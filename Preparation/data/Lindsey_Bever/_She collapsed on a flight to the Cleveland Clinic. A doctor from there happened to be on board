minutes into her flight , ashley spencer popped open a bag of chips and started to munch
for years , spencer has been suffering from a rare autoimmune disorder , and she hoped new medication might be able to help
so the 28-year-old was traveling from philadelphia to the renowned cleveland clinic on saturday to see whether she might be a candidate
the aircraft was barely in the air when spencer started to feel sick , she said
she told her mother she was going to the airplane bathroom to vomit
on her way back to her seat , she said , her face turned bright red , her throat started to tighten and she fell to the floor
i stopped breathing , she said monday in a phone interview with the washington post.
but i still had a pulse.
she said she woke up gasping for air and knew exactly what was happening because it had happened before
spencer , who has a severe peanut allergy , had gone into anaphylactic shock , a life-threatening allergic reaction
she said that her autoimmune condition churg-strauss syndrome , also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis makes her more sensitive to allergies she suspects that the chips , which she had purchased at the airport , may have been cooked in peanut oil
immediately , she started asking for her purse , where she kept epipens and an albuterol inhaler for emergencies
erich kiehl , an electrophysiology fellow from the cleveland clinic , was also on board american eagle flight 5471
he and another physician from duke university administered spencer 's two epipens and albuterol inhaler , then monitored her vitals until she started to stabilize , cleveland clinic spokeswoman andrea pacetti told the post

after spencer 's collapse , the plane was diverted to pittsburgh
spencer said kiehl administered a third epipen from his own kit , and that upon landing , she was given a fourth
she was rushed to a hospital in pittsburgh , where she said she was kept in the intensive care unit saturday night , according to abc affiliate wews
i am beyond thankful , she told the station.
i could have died up there.
spencer told the post that she was diagnosed with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in 2012
the disorder causes inflammation in the blood vessels , slowing down blood flow to vital organs and other tissues , according to the mayo clinic
over the past several years , she said , she has been undergoing regular chemotherapy treatments and taking steroids and other medications to manage her condition
she has been desperate for a better solution
that 's why , she said , she set up an appointment at the cleveland clinic to consult with experts
despite the incident , spencer made it to her appointment monday at the clinic and said she hoped to be able to thank kiehl in person while she was there
spencer said , adding that she has rush-ordered a plaque to give to kiehl.
words are never going to be able to express my gratitude.
she said she wants the doctor to always know that what he did was amazing.
kiehl could not immediately be reached for comment , but the cleveland clinic said that the doctor contended he was simply doing his job
the clinic said in a statement
following the incident , american airlines wished spencer a speedy recovery.
