have you ever thought a single vote doesnt really count
well , youd be wrong at least , if you voted in kentucky
more specifically , in kentuckys state house district 13 , where democratic candidate jim glenn beat the incumbent , republican rep. d.j
johnson , by a very narrow margin 6,319 people voted for glenn , and 6,318 voters cast their ballots for johnson
johnson could not immediately be reached for comment by the post , but he told the associated press that he had not been asking friends and family members whether they neglected to go to the polls
the teen who messed up his absentee ballot , creating virginias previous tied race
mary beverly goetz , from owensboro , ky. , said she knows that one vote does indeed matter because she cast her vote for glenn
goetz said she mailed in her ballot a couple of weeks before the election
goetz told the post , adding , im glad he won , and id vote for him again.
glenn represented the district from 2006 to 2017 , when johnson won the seat
this month , glenn reclaimed it
the votes were recanvassed thursday , meaning that the votes from machines were reviewed and upheld by the countys board of elections , and the states board of elections will meet next week to approve the results , according to the associated press
but johnson said its not over yet
other close elections have similarly made national headlines
late last year , a political battle played out between democrat shelly simonds and republican david yancey for a seat in virginias house of delegates
as the post reported on jan. 10
on election day , yancey appeared to win the race by 10 votes , but a recount put simonds ahead by one vote
the next day , a three-judge recount court ruled that a single ballot that had been discarded during the recount should be tallied for yancey
the race was tied with each candidate having 11,608 votes
a state election official broke the tie last thursday by picking yanceys name out of a stoneware bowl , a random drawing required under virginia law
