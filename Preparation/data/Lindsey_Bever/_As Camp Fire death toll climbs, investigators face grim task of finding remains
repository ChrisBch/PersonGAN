butte county sheriff kory honea said late sunday that search teams in butte county have recovered the remains of 29 people
most of them were found inside burned-out homes in and around the town of paradise or in cars that were overwhelmed by fire as locals desperately tried to outrun the fast-moving flames
the sheriff said 228 people are still unaccounted for , but many of them are probably in shelters
still , the death toll is likely to climb
the practical challenge , honea said , is finding the rest of the remains

during sunday nights briefing , the sheriff , who is also the county coroner , appeared to pause briefly to collect himself before announcing that the remains of six more victims had been found
the death toll 29 ties the camp fire with the deadliest in state history , the 1933 griffith park wildfire in los angeles
the camp fire burned nearly 7,000 buildings and is the most destructive individual fire in state history
by monday morning , officials said the fire had ravaged 113,000 acres , an area roughly the size of san jose , calif. , with just 25 percent containment
high temperatures and gusty winds made the weather optimal for the fire to spread for at least another day
officials said it is not expected to be fully contained until nov. 30
evacuation orders are still in effect for paradise , magalia , concow , butte creek canyon and butte valley
cal fire has released an interactive map showing the evacuation areas in the region
it was thursday evening when sol bechtold learned that a wildfire was raging across parts of northern california
bechtold , from the san francisco bay area , said he grabbed the phone and called his 75-year-old mother , joanne caddy , who lives near paradise in magalia
but , he said , the phone lines were down
he said watched live news broadcasts , which showed widespread devastation
worried , he called the sheriffs office and asked the deputies to go check on his mom
he said in a phone interview monday with the washington post.
i felt absolutely helpless
bechtold said his mother can no longer drive and does not have a car , so when the sheriffs office told him on saturday afternoon that her home had been destroyed , he became increasingly concerned
on sunday , bechtold and his wife started driving stopping at about 15 different shelters in the area to see whether his mother might have made it there
bechtold said he showed other evacuees his mothers photo and pinned up fliers on bulletin boards at the facilities
but , he said , we had no luck finding her.
bechtold ran thought through many scenarios maybe she was safe in someones cabin or staying at a local church
he told the post.
i cant give up
i wont give up.
in the wake of the devastating camp fire , sheriffs deputies and officials from the coroners office have been searching charred homes that have been too hot for body-sniffing dogs
the sheriff said that authorities have received more than 500 calls about friends and family members who are missing and that 107 of them have been located
however , in cases in which missing people are not found alive , he said relatives may be asked to provide a dna sample to help authorities identify the remains
in some cases , investigators have found only bone fragments
the victims have not been publicly identified
honeas office has ordered an additional dna lab truck and received help from two teams of anthropologists from california state university at chico for the time-consuming and daunting task of searching for and identifying victims
an anthropology team from nevada will join the efforts on monday
the sheriff told reporters.
there is still a great deal of work to do.
