there have been stories about passengers flying with cats and dogs and miniature horses
the list also includes a peacock , a hamster , a duck wearing a diaper and a defecating pig
now comes news of a
a passenger was removed from a frontier airlines flight late tuesday when she attempted to fly with her emotional support squirrel and then refused to get off the plane when she was told no , according to the airline
a frontier spokesman said in a statement that the passenger had alerted the airline that she would be bringing an emotional-support animal on the flight but did not mention it would be so
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
when the passenger declined , others aboard flight 1612 , which was traveling from orlando to cleveland , were forced to deplane so that authorities could remove the woman from the aircraft
fun fact frontier airlines features a variety of animals on the tails of its planes including foxy the red fox , rudy the raccoon , jim bob the badger and even sammy the squirrel.
sammy is featured on an airbus a320-214 flight 1612 was an airbus a321 and , thus , would not have had the squirrel tail
can you really bring a peacock on a plane
service and support animals , explained
the incident occurred tuesday night at orlando international airport
the orlando police department said that the squirrels owner had boarded the plane but that when airline personnel noticed she had a cage containing the little critter , they asked her to deplane
when she refused , authorities were called to escort her from the plane
authorities said that the passenger vacated the plane when officers arrived and that they did not have to take any action.
a subsequent video showed a woman being escorted through the airport in a wheelchair as others clapped and cheered
earlier this month , frontier announced a new policy on emotional-support and trained service animals that is set to go into effect nov. 1
it allows cats and dogs as emotional-support animals and restricts trained service animals to cats , dogs and miniature horses
emotional-support animals , or comfort animals , are not the same thing as service animals or therapy animals , which are typically trained to assist people with emotional and physical disabilities
as the washington post has reported , emotional-support animals are not covered under the americans with disabilities act , meaning businesses are not required to accommodate them
federal regulations do permit them on airplanes but give the airlines permission to turn away unusual animals
according to the posts karin brulliard
airlines can require passengers with creatures in the second category to produce a letter from a physician or mental health professional , but the documents are easily forged or obtained from websites that provide cursory , questionnaire-style exams.
the result , airline officials complain , has been a surge in poorly trained animals that has turned some flights into airborne menageries , with dogs blocking beverage carts , cats urinating on seats and ducks wandering the aisles
