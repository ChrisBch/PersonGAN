british masterchef critic and magazine editor william sitwell is battling backlash over a comment he made about killing vegans , one by one.
buzzfeed reported that sitwell , the editor of waitrose food magazine , made the statement in an email to freelance writer selene nelson , who had pitched a series on plant-based cooking
but he said in a statement wednesday on instagram that he wanted to make two remarks

heres his side of the story
nelson , who has written for huffpost , salon and various other publications , posted what she said was the email exchange on twitter earlier this week
in her initial email to sitwell , nelson pitched him a regular series on vegan cooking for people who are keen to discover plant-based meal ideas.
following the article on buzzfeed and in the interests of transparency here 's my original pitch to the editor of waitrose , along with my response to his reply
no triggered vegans here , thanks

hi - even though this was a private email conversation , we feel williams email is unacceptable and the words he uses are inappropriate and insensitive
sitwell is known for his role on masterchef a critic with an acid tongue and a distinct dislike of square plates , according to the sun
after sitwells email was made public , it prompted a heated debate on social media , where critics called his comment a ridiculous response and questioned how it could be interpreted as a joke
john brown media , which produces waitrose & partners food magazine , confirmed wednesday that sitwell is stepping down as editor
