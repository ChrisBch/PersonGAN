on his final day , before he went to a swiss clinic to die , david goodall spoke about his 104 years of life and his scheduled death
the australian scientist , who had traveled to switzerland to end his life because euthanasia is n't legal in his homeland , answered questions about his well-publicized plans for an assisted suicide did he want to eat anything in particular for his last meal
he did n't know
did he want any special song played at his bedside
he was n't sure but if he had to choose one , it would be the final movement of beethovens 9th symphony
then , the 104-year-old man burst spontaneously into song , singing in german
freude , schner gtterfunken tochter aus elysium , wir betreten feuertrunken , himmlische , dein heiligtum
in accordance with his plan , goodall died thursday at an assisted-suicide clinic , putting an end to a life that , he said , had become increasingly difficult to live
around midday , an iv was placed into goodall 's arm , allowing him to turn a wheel to let the lethal drugs to flow into his bloodstream , according to exit international , an australian nonprofit that advocates for the legalization of euthanasia
david fell asleep within a few minutes , exit international said in a statement , which noted that he was accompanied by his grandchildren
the ode to joy of beethovens 9th symphony began to play in german
then , just as the song concluded , goodall died , said the nonprofit 's founder , philip nitschke
this australian scientist just turned 104
now hes flying to switzerland to die
goodall , a botanist and ecologist who was thought to be australias oldest scientist , said on his 104th birthday last month he had simply lived too long
the 104-year-old man added
assisted suicide is banned in australia , so goodall boarded a plane last week and traveled more than 8,000 miles to basel , a swiss city near the french and german borders
switzerland , like many other countries , has not passed legislation legalizing assisted suicide but under some circumstances , its laws do not forbid it
in most countries , euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are illegal
however , a handful of nations including belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands have legalized one or both of the practices , according to the nonprofit group procon.org
for years , australia has banned such practices , but in november , the state of victoria became the first to pass a euthanasia bill , which , by summer 2019 , will allow terminally ill patients to end their lives
the law states
any person who for selfish motives incites or assists another to commit or attempt to commit suicide is , if that other person thereafter commits or attempts to commit suicide , liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding five years or to a monetary penalty
in the united states , only six states california , colorado , hawaii , oregon , vermont and washington state and washington , d.c. , have death-with-dignity laws for terminally ill patients
goodall said he did not have a terminal illness and until recent years , he appeared to be in good health
the abc reported at the time that after nearly two decades on the campus , goodall was told to leave amid concerns about his well-being
the incident gained international media attention , with goodall , then 102 , calling it ageism in the workplace
university officials later reversed their decision
goodall said he had a good life , but in recent years , his health had declined
he told the abc that several months ago , he fell down in his apartment in perth and , for two days , he lay on the floor until his housekeeper found him
i called out , but no one could hear me , he said
goodall said he thought it was time for him to die
but his countrys new legislation was of no use to him because it applies only to those who are terminally ill
for his final news conference wednesday in basel , goodall wore a shirt that said ageing disgracefully.
he said there were things he would miss , such as his journeys into the australian countryside.
he told reporters.
i am content to leave them undone.
he stressed that it was his own choice to end my life and said i look forward to that.
goodall said he hoped his story would encourage lawmakers to consider legislation to allow others like him to make their own decisions about death
in the end , goodall said , he would like to be remembered as an instrument of freeing the elderly to choose their own death
