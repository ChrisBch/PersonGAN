it almost sounded like heavy rain
rocks had started to tumble down mont blanc , the tallest mountain in the alps , and billionaire mogul sir richard branson and his son , sam , sought shelter behind a boulder , he wrote on his blog
branson said a small rock skipped across his sons head , loudly clipping his helmet on the way down
but the father and son emerged uninjured
.sambranson had been filming on his camera as we crossed the gouter couloir and although you dont see the boulders falling , you get a sense of the drama that unfolded
they posted about the dangerous expedition sunday on social media , saying it was part of the virgin strive challenge , which raises money for charity , according to the website
the father and son had joined several others to climb mont blanc , which is the highest peak in western europe , and richard branson said they were crossing gouter couloir , known as the gully of death , when it happened
branson , 68 , could not immediately be reached for comment by the washington post

a video that sam branson posted on instagram showed small rocks scattering down the mountainside as the father and son seemed to be taking cover
sam branson said in the post that some of the rocks were as small as coins but that others were as big as refrigerators

someone called out in the video
it seemed that sam branson then told his father to stay still and to protect his head
on his blog , the elder branson said his nephew noah devereux watched it all unfold from afar and thought the bransons were dead
my nephew noah was five minutes ahead and had watched with horror the side of the mountain giving way and although he heard our shouts of take cover he was too far away to see what was happening
for a horrifying moment , when noah turned to find us , all he saw was a gigantic rock where we should have been
he thought we were dead and broke down completely
for a few minutes he thought hed lost us
but by some miracle we all survived
when we were finally able to struggle to our hut for the night the tears of relief flowed and there were hugs all round
for a month we had spent every day together
my son sam and nephew noah , who are the drivers behind these incredible challenges , made me unbelievably proud every day
they motivated and helped their fellow strivers to complete every stage we faced , no matter the difficulty
sam and noah were determined that mont blanc would not defeat us
the next morning , as a team , we set off to conquer that summit
devereux told sky news that he was terrified
throughout all of our challenges i have never come so terrifyingly close to losing myself , my son and other team mates and it all happened in a matter of seconds virgin strivechallenge
branson has been in dangerous situations in the past
as the washington post previously reported , during hurricane irma , which ravaged the caribbean islands in 2017 , the virgin group founder hid out in his wine cellar on his private island
branson said in a blog post at the time
after the recent incident in the alps , branson said , we are lucky to be alive
