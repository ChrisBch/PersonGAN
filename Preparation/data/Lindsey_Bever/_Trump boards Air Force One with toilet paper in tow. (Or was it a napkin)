excuse me , mr. president , i believe you have some toilet paper stuck to your shoe said no one
alas , president trump made an embarrassing climb into air force one on thursday with what appeared to be some sort of paper product attached to the bottom of his shoe
video showed him stepping out of a limousine in front of the aircraft at the minneapolis-st. paul international airport and start up the staircase with a couple squares of toilet paper or , perhaps , a napkin , billowing in the wind with each step
what about the dozen or so people surrounding him
as he reached the top , the president seemingly oblivious turned around and waved goodbye
soggy president takes toilet paper with him
historically , toilet paper and shoes have gone together much like humiliating faux pas and deep , tear-inducing belly laughter
those who had the privilege to see it happen either live or later on while watching videos on social media couldnt help but share it
cnn political commentator ana navarro posted a clip on social media
starting the day with a little comic relief , she wrote friday on twitter
starting the day with a little comic relief while we were all distracted fighting over the future of the republic , trump climbed all the way up the stairs of air force one , with toilet-paper stuck to his shoe
so did abby huntsman , co-host of the view , though she showed some sympathy for the president
weve all been here
