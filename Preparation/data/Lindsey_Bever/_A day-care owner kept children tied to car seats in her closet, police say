one of the childrens parents contacted police late last week , stating that he and his wife had attached a small camera to their 6-month-olds car seat and discovered how anderson was treating their son
the video apparently revealed that anderson had yanked their child from his car seat by his ankle and , at one point , pulled him up by a bib around his neck , according to court records
the court records state that the video also showed anderson giving the infant an unknown substance through a syringe
the parent told the police that the child does not need any medication
on friday , police searched andersons home in mesquite , a dallas suburb , and found several children strapped into car seats some of which had the padded inserts removed inside a bedroom closet and a bathroom , according to the court records
the doors were closed and the lights were out , the court records state , and at least some of the children had ligatures around their necks.
the ligatures were determined to be cotton shoelaces , according to the court documents , and they were so tight that the children had to be cut free from their seats.

when asked about the syringe , anderson first told the investigators that she did not give the children medication but later admitted that she had probably given them tylenol , according to the court records
after the investigation , the investigators called the childrens parents to pick them up and advised them to take the children to a nearby hospital for evaluation
anderson is being held in dallas county jail on a $ 45,000 bond , according to booking records
