after a nationwide class-action lawsuit against motel 6 , the chain agreed to pay as much as $ 7.6 million to guests who said their private information was given to u.s. immigration agents , according to court records
former guests sued motel 6 over privacy violations earlier this year , alleging that the chain handed over their personal information to u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) agents , according to the lawsuit
the lawsuit came after a 2017 phoenix new times report that ice agents made at least 20 arrests at two motel 6 locations in arizona
under the proposed settlement agreement , the hotel also agreed not to share guests personal information without a warrant or subpoena , unless necessary to prevent a significant crime , according to the document
thomas saenz , president and general counsel at the mexican american legal defense and educational fund ( maldef ) , told the washington post on tuesday
maldef represented the guests in the class-action lawsuit
motel 6 gave guest lists to ice agents looking for 'latino-sounding names , lawsuit alleges
motel 6 and maldef said in a joint statement that the hotel has prohibited employees from sharing such information
the hotel chain did not , however , admit to any wrongdoing
ice did not immediately respond tuesday to a request for comment
maldef filed the lawsuit in january on behalf of seven class representatives from arizona and one from washington state
it alleged that employees at motel 6 locations in arizona gave hispanic guests personal information , such as their mexican passports and other forms of identification , to agents from the department of homeland security and ice without warrants being served
the lawsuit states that guests were then interrogated and arrested
the lawsuit was filed after a report in phoenix news times by antonia noori farzan showed that from february to august 2017 , ice agents arrested a motel 6 guest about every two weeks in arizona
( farzan is now a reporter at the washington post )
furthermore , motel 6 will cover the cost of the former guests legal fees
the settlement agreement must still be approved by the district court
