a pig was taken into police custody after it was accused of stalking a human , who was so perplexed by his four-legged pursuer that he called 911 to report it
yes , police said , a pig.
the unusual case unfolded saturday morning when a man called 911 and said that he was being followed on his way home from an amtrak station in ohio
it made for a surreal emergency call
north ridgeville police , the dispatcher answered
the caller said
dispatcher a pig , you said
caller yes.
the dispatcher chuckled , then composed herself and told the man she would send an officer to the scene
the north ridgeville police department later suggested that it was at least a little skeptical about the call
a pig
riiiight , the department wrote in a lighthearted facebook post
so what did the authorities do
the only logical thing they put the animal in the back of a patrol car and took it to a dog kennel , where its owners would be able to find it
ryan singley , the caller who reported the oddity , told cleveland abc affiliate wews that the animal was friendly
he told the station , adding that the animal seemed pretty good-natured
these men thought they adopted a mini piglet
she became esther the wonder pig , a 650-pound darling of the internet
north ridgeville police capt
marti garrow told the washington post on monday that the pig is somebodys pet and that it had dug itself out of its fenced-in yard
garrow said officers took the animal , which he said weighs between 35 and 50 pounds , to a dog kennel until its owners could pick it up
the pig , identified by police as zoey ( or perhaps zoe ) , has been returned to its home , he said
in the end , police were not oblivious to the humor
the department said
