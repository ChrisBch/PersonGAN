an australian bridal magazine is shutting down after standing by a controversial decision not to feature same-sex couples
the founders of white magazine said in a statement saturday that they have received a flood of judgment since making their decision during the same-sex marriage debate and legalization in 2017
luke and carla burrell wrote
the couple said that magazine staffers , advertisers and even couples who had been featured in the magazine were suddenly the subject of online abuse despite their individual beliefs.
their statement read
he blushed and asked his partner to marry him during a parliamentary same-sex marriage debate
australias parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage in december 2017 , joining many countries , including the united states , that now recognize such unions
and as in many other countries , there was an impassioned debate leading up to the vote , which gained widespread support from people across the country
while debating the issue in australias house of representatives , one lawmaker , liberal party member tim wilson , paused for a moment and proposed to his longtime partner , saying the same-sex marriage debate had been the soundtrack to their relationship
the founders of white magazine , who are christian , said they created the publication more than a decade ago to celebrate relationships
during the same-sex marriage debate , the couple said , people began asking why the magazine did not feature same-sex couples in its pages
carla burrell said in a video statement on the magazines website
but her husband , luke , said that the couple understood why their decision was contentious
he said in the video
the announcement drew a wide range of responses on social media some from people saying they are heartbroken by the magazines closure and others telling the founders , you reap what you sow.
another wrote , i guess all the ones who preached to us last year that love is love , about tolerance and acceptance actually dont practise what they preach and are the exact opposite of what they claim
some , however , praised the founders for standing up for their beliefs
there have been similar debates in the united states , where some ministers have declined to marry gay couples and businesses have refused to provide services for the wedding ceremonies
perhaps one of the most highly publicized cases was in colorado , where a christian baker refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple
the case was taken to the u.s. supreme court , which sided with the baker
