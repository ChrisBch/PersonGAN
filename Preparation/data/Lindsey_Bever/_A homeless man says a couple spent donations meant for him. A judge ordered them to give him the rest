after a new jersey couple raised more than $ 400,000 for a homeless veteran , and after allegations that they refused to give it all to him , a judge has ordered the couple to turn over the remaining money
bobbitt has alleged that mcclure and d'amico withheld the money and spent at least some of it on themselves a claim the couple largely denies
instead , the couple have said that they were attempting to help bobbitt manage it because they worried he would spend the donations on drugs
the judge gave the couple until friday afternoon to place the remaining money into an escrow account that will be managed by bobbitt 's attorneys until a guardian can be appointed by the court to oversee it , according to the associated press
the news agency reported that the judge also instructed them to provide an accounting of how the money has been spent
the couple said this week on nbcs megyn kelly today that there was well over $ 150,000 of the money remaining
bobbitt 's attorney , jacqueline promislo , told the washington post in a phone interview friday afternoon that its sad it came to this but said bobbitt and his attorneys are extremely pleased about the ruling
hes homeless and penniless , promislo said about bobbitt
she added that her client wants what he wanted before a home to live in , clothes to wear and food to eat and the money that was intended for him
mcclure and d'amico could not immediately be reached for comment
they raised $ 400,000 for a homeless man who claims they spent it on vacations , casinos and a bmw
there are conflicting reports from the couple and bobbitt about how the money was used and whether bobbitt was a participant or a victim
mcclure and d'amico raised nearly $ 403,000 on gofundme starting late last year to buy bobbitt , among other things , his own home and dream truck a 1999 ford ranger
as the post previously reported , mcclure and d'amico started the crowdfunding campaign after bobbitt came to mcclure 's rescue on the side of the road
mcclure had run out of gas on interstate 95 in philadelphia , and bobbitt walked to a service station and spent $ 20 of his own money to buy her gas
johnny did not ask me for a dollar , and i couldnt repay him at that moment because i didnt have any cash , but i have been stopping by his spot for the past few weeks , mcclure wrote on gofundme.
i repaid him for the gas , gave him a jacket , gloves , a hat , and warm socks , and i give him a few dollars every time i see him
i wish that i could do more for this selfless man , who went out of his way just to help me that day
he is such a great guy , and talking to him each time i see him makes me want to help him more and more
mcclure and d'amico hoped the gofundme effort would raise $ 10,000 , but the story resonated
it was featured in national newspapers , including the post
the pair made an appearance on good morning america and were interviewed by bbc news a feel-good story at the start of the holiday season
ultimately , the campaign raised more than $ 402,000 from more than 14,000 donors
but then the story soured with accusations of mismanagement and outright theft of the money raised on bobbitts behalf
the gofundme cash , bobbitt suspected , had been squandered on vacations , a luxury car and more than one addiction
bobbitt met with a financial adviser but never had access to the money or signed paperwork for a trust , according to the philadelphia inquirer
but bobbitt said he saw troubling signs
mcclure is a receptionist for the new jersey department of transportation and damico is a carpenter , according to the inquirer
but suddenly she had a new bmw , and the couple were taking vacations to florida and california and las vegas , bobbitt told the inquirer
he learned of a helicopter ride they took over the grand canyon
and bobbitt told the inquirer that damico gambled away some of the gofundme money at a casino in philadelphia
( damico told the newspaper he had indeed used $ 500 from the bank account to gamble on a night when he forgot his sugarhouse casino card but had quickly repaid the money with his winnings
the couple have denied that they used any more of the money for anything else for themselves )
the inquirer reported that damico spoke of expenses he and his girlfriend had incurred caring for bobbitt , including time that they took off from work
and damico gave an evolving account of how he handled the money to the inquirer
initially , he said he would not produce financial records because the money was put into an existing account at pnc bank that does not belong to bobbitt
on wednesday , he said he and mcclure had opened up a separate account for bobbitt
on thursday morning he said he told a reporter the trusts had been set up because thats what bobbitt wanted him to say
the money that came to bobbitt couldnt stop his addiction
he went through two unsuccessful stints in rehab that brought him no closer to being sober
some of the money gofundme donors gave to him ended up in the pockets of drug dealers , bobbitt told the inquirer
in april , six months after his fateful meeting with mcclure , bobbitt told the inquirer that he had been clean for three weeks and jobless for much longer
he told the newspaper about his addiction
bobbitts attorney told the post that he is in detox and working to get his life back
amid the backlash , mcclure and d'amico said on megyn kelly today earlier this week that they welcomed bobbitt into their family and tried to help him
because he had no bank account or documentation , the couple said , they initially put the donations in their own account and used it to buy bobbitt the things that he needed such as a camper that d'amico said bobbitt told him he wanted
the couple said they let bobbitt park it on land owned by mcclures family , but the associated press reported that in june , d'amico told him to leave
d'amico said that he and his girlfriend later opened a bank account for bobbitt once he got his affairs in order but that they deposited only $ 25,000 of the $ 400,000 in it because they suspected he was spending the money on drugs
and within 13 days , d'amico said on megyn kelly today , bobbitt had blown through it
