the student is in custody and the gun has been secured
after the incident , one student 's mother , amy wheeler , told the quad-city times that she started freaking out when she got a call about what had happened
its a crazy world out here , wheeler said
eldridge police chief david kopatich and north scott superintendent joe stutting said in a joint statement last week that in response to the incident , district officials implemented a safety plan
it 's still unclear where the boy got the gun or why he apparently took it to school and tried to shoot a teacher , but the teacher is being credited with helping to prevent another tragic school shooting
authorities said that when the gun failed to fire , the teacher wrestled the weapon from the boy , according to the quad-city times
the teacher in the room the decisions that she made made all the difference in the world , stutting , the superintendent , told the washington post

according to the quad-city times
in a motion arguing for his release , the boys attorneys said all weapons have been removed from his home , the family is seeking mental health treatment and the boy is to be home-schooled by his stay-at-home mother following his expulsion from school
the defense attorneys also suggested the court could place the boy on gps monitoring as the case moves forward
state laws allow for juvenile court proceedings to be held behind closed doors
but the prosecuting attorney in scott county has asked the court to try the boy as a youthful offender , which means the trial proceedings would happen in adult court if the judge approves
if convicted as a youthful offender , the boy would be supervised by the juvenile court system until his 18th birthday , then be sentenced in adult court
a spokesman for the scott county attorney 's office said that if the boy 's case is not moved to adult court , his trial will begin oct. 26 in juvenile court
