jemel roberson had dreams of becoming a police officer
he was killed by one
the 26-year-old was working as an armed security guard sunday when he tried to intervene during a shooting outside a chicago-area bar
officers arrived , and officials later said saw a man with a gun
a midlothian police officer opened fire after ordering the man to drop the weapon
that man was roberson
he was trying to subdue one of the suspects , investigators later said , when the officer shot him
roberson later died at a hospital
now amid an uproar and questions about police training and operations the citys police chief said he is mourning the loss of roberson
the department has not released the name of the officer , who has been put on administrative leave
they basically saw a black man with a gun police kill armed guard while responding to call
according to a federal lawsuit filed by beatrice roberson , her son was working security early sunday at mannys blue room bar in robbins , ill. , when some patrons shot the bartender and others were shot.
the suit , filed in u.s. district court in the northern district of illinois , says robersons civil rights were violated
investigators said the police response began after reports of gunfire in a dispute at the bar after 4 a.m. on sunday
officers from two departments , including midlothians , arrived to find roberson armed and trying to subdue a suspect in a parking lot
before he fired , according to a preliminary report by the illinois state police that cited witnesses
officers provided medical aid to multiple victims , including roberson , the report found
but the report did not say how long the officer waited before he fired or whether he identified himself as a police officer
investigators also appear to distance officers from accountability to determine who is a threat , and who is not
roberson wore no markings readily identifying him as a security guard , the report found
witnesses have also said they tried to warn officers that roberson was trying to help
adam harris told wgn
kulis , the family attorney , said roberson was doing what he was supposed to when he was shot and killed
he was a hero
he probably saved lives , kulis said
thats a tragedy.
the incident closely tracks with theoretical situations that advocates have suggested would curtail violence a weapon is drawn , shots are fired , and then a good guy with a gun steps in to help before the police can respond
that ideal doesnt account for the chaotic unknowns when police arrive and cant tell a good guy with a gun from a bad guy with a gun
the incident may become a touchstone in a persistent debate about how places such as schools , nightclubs and houses of worship should steel themselves against gunmen
two oklahoma citizens killed an active shooter , and it 's not as simple as it sounds
that debate has gained urgency during the past year , as president trump and others have repeatedly said security guards specifically armed ones could have prevented the nations mass shootings this year , trump tweeted his support for the controversial idea of arming teachers
the sunday incident has already provoked concerns that black men even when legally carrying firearms or employed in positions that allows their use can still become targets for police fire
robersons friends said he had talked all his life of becoming a police officer
said christian torres , 21.
this is someone who was on their side.
roberson had a valid gun owners license but did not have a concealed-carry permit , wgn reported
in minnesota in 2016 , philando castile was killed by an officer during a traffic stop seconds after he told an officer there was a weapon in the car
the cook county sheriffs office and the robbins police department , neither of which responded to requests for comment , are investigating the shooting that first drew the police to the scene , delaney said
illinois state police will investigate robersons killing by the midlothian officer
roberson is one of at least 840 people who have been shot and killed by police so far in 2018 and one of at least 19 in illinois , according to a washington post database
at least 181 of those shot and killed by police this year 22 percent were black
the u.s. population is about 13 percent black
we are armed now in kentucky , shootings leave a black church and the white community around it shaken
more than half of those killed 459 people , including roberson were said to be armed when police killed them
the oldest of four children , roberson grew up in wicker park , a neighborhood in the north side of chicago about 27 miles from robbins
his family said he was in law school and was a role model for his peers , inspiring young men to become involved with the church
said malik harris , 20 , a cousin of robersons
marvin hunter told the associated press that roberson played organ at his church and others in the area
he called him an upstanding young man who was working to regain custody of his son and earn money for a new apartment
hunter is the great-uncle of laquan mcdonald , a black teenager who was shot and killed by a white chicago police officer in 2014
