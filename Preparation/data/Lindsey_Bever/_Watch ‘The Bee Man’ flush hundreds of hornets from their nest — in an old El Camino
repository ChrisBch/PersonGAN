watson posted the video on facebook over the weekend , showing him pumping pesticide into the hornets nest before breaking it apart
he said the nest , which he estimated to weigh between three and four pounds , filled several plastic bags
watson , also a beekeeper who rescues honeybees , said he exterminates hornets because they are pests and can kill honeybees
watson said the hornets , which look for confined spaces away from the elements , had gotten into the vehicle through a crack in the window

watson said european hornets are new to the area he services around austintown , ohio , about 70 miles southeast of cleveland
