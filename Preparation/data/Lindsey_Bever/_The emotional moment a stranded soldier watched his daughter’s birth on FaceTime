brooks lindsey sat in camo against the wall at an airport in texas , his eyes locked on his cellphone screen as his wife began to give birth
the 25-year-old soldier , who said he had been in training at fort bliss , tex. , was trying to make it home to brandon , miss. , to welcome their first child into the world
but his flight got delayed last week at dallas-fort worth international airport , so he hunkered down and watched every moment on facetime , from more than 400 miles away
fellow passengers captured lindseys reaction on video , showing his eyes growing wide as his wife started to push
he broke focus and blew out a breath , reached for a water bottle and then looked back at the screen
it was a pretty exciting and scary moment , he said wednesday in a phone interview from fort bliss
moments later , his daughter was born 7 pounds , 6 ounces and 21 inches long with blue eyes and a head full of hair , the new father said
a crowd of passengers who were gathered around him clapped and cheered
an airline employee made an announcement at the gate , congratulating him on the addition to his family , a passenger said
then he hopped on the plane , rushing home to hold his daughter , millie fritzanne lindsey , for the first time

lindsey has been in training at fort bliss with the mississippi national guard , preparing for deployment overseas
lindsey said his wife , haley , 22 , was told by her doctors may 3 that she needed an emergency induction because she was at risk of high blood pressure and preeclampsia
so lindsey was granted emergency leave and , the next day , was on a plane bound for mississippi
during a connection in dallas on friday afternoon , lindseys flight home was delayed due to maintenance issues
fellow passenger jane carpenter , from flora , miss. , said she could tell the soldier was distressed , so she approached him and asked what was wrong
it was about 5 p.m. , and lindsey said he wanted to be at his wifes side
i asked him , how close is she
she said he responded i think shes real close.
carpenter , who is a nurse , said she told lindsey to call his mother , who was in the delivery room , and ask her to facetime the birth so he wouldnt miss it
carpenter said that when the airline called them to board , someone ran up to the flight crew and asked them to slow it down
but , she said , the child was born before the father was even called to the gate
indeed , millie was born at precisely 5:23 p.m
he went from tears to the biggest smile you ever saw , carpenter said about the soldiers reaction to the birth
she said , adding that the soldiers fellow passengers were clapping and cheering.
everybody was just beside themselves with excitement.

lindsey said his delayed flight was a blessing in disguise , explaining that if he had been in the air , he would have never been able to see his daughter enter the world
two hours later , lindsey walked into the hospital
lindsey said that , at the time , he had no idea he was being filmed and photographed in the airport.
i was just in my own little zone , he explained
but he said he is surprised by the overwhelming response from strangers wishing him all the best
he told the washington post , but it turned into something much more than we anticipated.
lindsey has returned to fort bliss but with a story to tell
