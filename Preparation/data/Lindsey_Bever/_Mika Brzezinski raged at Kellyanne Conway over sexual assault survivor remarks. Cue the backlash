following white house counselor kellyanne conways statement that christine blasey ford had been treated like a faberg egg , an msnbc host dared conway to be the egg and share her own sexual assault story
but brzezinskis comments prompted intense criticism from others on social media including from the press secretary for vice president pence saying survivors should never be forced to share and leading brzezinski to defend her impassioned words
a spokeswoman for msnbc declined to comment
president trump angrily lashes out at morning joe hosts on twitter
in the past , brzezinski has been singled out by the white house in personal and demeaning terms
last year , president trump viciously attacked her on twitter , calling her low i.q
crazy mika and saying she had recently had plastic surgery
i heard poorly rated morning_joe speaks badly of me ( do n't watch anymore )
then how come low i.q
crazy mika , along with psycho joe , came..
... to mar-a-lago 3 nights in a row around new year 's eve , and insisted on joining me
she was bleeding badly from a face-lift
i said no
on thursday , brzezinski was responding to the statement conway made while speaking to reporters about ford
trump mocked ford at a political rally this week , ridiculing her testimony and laughing with a crowd of thousands , but conway didnt see trumps remarks in those terms
conway did not respond to a request for comment
if women are being treated like faberg eggs when they announce their stories , then you go ahead and tell yours and see how easy it is , okay
following brzezinskis on-air rant , other political commentators took to twitter , questioning whether survivors should be pressured to share their stories
im rarely genuinely appalled , but mika attacking kellyannepolls for sharing her experience with sexual assault & claiming it was political is one of the ugliest things ive seen
brzezinski responded harshly to her critics with a series of tweets , many of which she has since deleted
id did not force
i said try being the egg .watch the whole thing
i think its terrible to support the mocking of a victim greta
i respect you so i will go further..
i made my point understanding..that it is so hard .. how dare kc say ford was being treated by a faberge egg..
i said try being the egg.
as she knows its not easy
and greta , try to up the level on what you read
this web site consistently manipulates the truth to make headlines that are incorrect
you should know better
im disappointed - i really respect you
later in the morning , cuomo said he was removing his original tweet
i am all about engagement and disagreement - but i am not about adding to ha politics and using victims as fodder
ford was victimized again - by politics
i wont add to that
i have no fight with mika or anyone
we must be united on respecting victims
