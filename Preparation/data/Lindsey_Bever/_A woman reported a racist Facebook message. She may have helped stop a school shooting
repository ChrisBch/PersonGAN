koeberle bull had never met the man who contacted her on facebook calling her a wan na be black woman and telling her that he hoped her black children gets hung for you being so stupid.
worried for her biracial children , the 40-year-old mother of three said she contacted local authorities in lumberton township , n.j. , telling them about the chilling facebook message she received from a stranger three states away , in kentucky
then , she said , she made contact with kentucky state police
in the process , authorities said , bull may have helped police prevent a school shooting
kentucky state police officials said the man , 20-year-old dylan jarrell , was found last week with a firearm and more than 200 rounds of ammunition , posing a credible and imminent threat to two school districts in western kentucky
he was arrested on two counts of second-degree terroristic threatening and one count of harassing communications , according to police
kentucky state police commissioner rick sanders said at a news conference
more than 215,000 students have experienced gun violence at school since columbine
she said she has no connections to kentucky no family members or friends there
it is unclear whether jarrell knows anyone in her state
she told cbs affiliate wkyt that after jarrell sent her the facebook message , he blocked her account , so she was not able to view his personal information
but she asked friends to tell her where the man lived so that she could contact the authorities there
she told the station
bull said her husband , who died in 2012 , was black
she said tuesday
she was shocked to hear what police learned
after receiving the complaint last week , kentucky state police investigators discovered that jarrell , who is white , had been previously questioned by the fbi about threats against a school in tennessee
when kentucky troopers went to question him thursday , he was leaving his home in anderson county , ky. , with a firearm and ammunition , a kevlar vest and a detailed plan of attack , according to state police
authorities contacted the school districts in anderson and shelby counties and worked with administrators to determine a plan of action.
schools in anderson county were closed friday the shelby county school district , which is on fall break , suspended all activities at shelby county high school
police have not said why jarrell might have targeted the districts
michael clark , director of student services for shelby county public schools , said jarrell was last enrolled in shelby county high school in 2013 but said he could not share further details due to the ongoing investigation
anderson county schools superintendent sheila mitchell said jarrell had not been enrolled in the school district except for a general educational development ( ged ) test class in 2016
jarrell completed his ged last year , mitchell said , adding that there had been no reports about worrisome behavior when he was in the program
since the columbine high school massacre in 1999 , more than 215,000 students in the united states have been exposed to gun violence on their school campuses , according to a washington post database
so far this year , there have been at least 17 school shootings
officials in both school districts in kentucky said they were grateful to the state police as well as the new jersey mother who brought a potentially horrific situation to their attention
mitchell told the post.
were very grateful to her
i believe that she , with her efforts to protect her children , protected a lot of other children in kentucky
bull , the mother , said the experience has been humbling.
