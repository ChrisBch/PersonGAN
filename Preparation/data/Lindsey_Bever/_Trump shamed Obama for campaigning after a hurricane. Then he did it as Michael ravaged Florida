the president announced wednesday afternoon that he would attend a previously scheduled rally in erie , pa. an opportunity to campaign leading up to the midterm elections
he wrote on twitter.
i look forward to seeing everyone this evening.
but at the time , trump said it was wrong
andrew weinstein , co-chair of the democrats national lawyers council , wrote wednesday on twitter , mocking trumps 2012 remarks
trump rallies supporters in pennsylvania as hurricane michael makes landfall
but some questioned whether trump should have attended at all
in fact , sen. brian schatz ( d-hawaii ) posed that precise question
is it appropriate for the president to be at a rally
rep. debbie wasserman schultz ( d-fla. ) posted video of a live cnn broadcast showing the storm raging in panama city beach
its not clear which expression he was referencing
just when you think his conduct and indifference couldnt be more revolting , realdonaldtrump holds a political rally while florida and georgia are getting hit by the worst hurricane since andrew
and mocks women and the metoo movement
then rep. eric swalwell ( d-calif. ) criticized the president for campaigning while millions suffered from hurricanemichael.
last night , realdonaldtrump went to a political rally while millions suffered from hurricanemichael
what do you think the american president should have done
according to mediaite
at the same time , fox & friends co-host brian kilmeade called it a good move.
kilmeade said , according to media matters for america
he added that i think that was , overall , a good move.
trump said on fox news channel that he did not cancel the previously scheduled event because he did not want to disappoint all of his supporters
we had thousands of people lined up from yesterday
i mean , literally , they stayed 24 hours and sometimes more than that to go to these rallies
they like them
you probably saw the pictures on television tonight , thousands and thousands of people outside after the arena
it was a big arena
but it was full
and we had 15,000 or beyond that people outside
and so , you had these people waiting for hours , many hours
and if i didnt go , that would have been the wrong thing , too
trump said people there had a fantastic time.
trump echoed his comments thursday morning on fox & friends.
yesterday obama campaigned with jayz & springsteen while hurricane sandy victims across ny & nj are still decimated by sandy
departing the whitehouse for erie , pennsylvania
i can not disappoint the thousands of people that are there - and the thousands that are going
i look forward to seeing everyone this evening
cnn reported that candidates running for u.s. senate and governor in florida postponed their campaigning to focus on hurricane michael , which has since been downgraded to a tropical storm
his opponent , sen. bill nelson ( d-fla. ) , was planning to meet with emergency management authorities to make sure local officials have everything they need , a spokesman told cnn
gubernatorial candidate and tallahassee mayor andrew gillum ( d ) said sunday that he would be stepping away from his campaign temporarily to prepare for the looming natural disaster
