last week , johnny bobbitt filed a lawsuit against the new jersey couple , alleging that they withheld most of the money and spent it on vacations , gambling and a luxury car
a judge gave mcclure and d'amico until this past monday to hand over the remaining money , according to the philadelphia inquirer
but a day after the deadline , an attorney for bobbitt said there was no money left to surrender
on thursday , the couple 's home was searched as part of a criminal investigation , burlington county prosecutor scott coffina said in a statement , but charges have not been filed , cnn reported
during the search , the couple looked unhurried
tv news footage showed d'amico whiffing a golf club on the lawn as officers carried boxes of evidence out of his house
he fiddled with his baseball cap and played fetch with a dog
mcclure stayed mostly out of sight before driving away in a white sedan

bobbitt 's legal team has asked judge paula t. dow to force the couple to stay in new jersey , give up their passports and not spend any money from their bank accounts , the inquirer reported
dow has since asked the couple to appear in court monday for depositions , saying that she had heard enough from their attorney and that it was time they spoke for themselves , according to reporting from cnn
the couple 's attorney , ernest badway , refused to comment on the search and whether his clients would show up to be deposed
if they flee , they 're taking the money with them , jacqueline promislo , another of bobbitt 's attorneys , told the inquirer.
we 're really concerned about the flight risk
during an appearance on megyn kelly 's nbc show last week , mcclure and d'amico insisted that $ 150,000 remained of the money they had raised for bobbitt
the court had ordered them to account for what they had spent and put the rest in a trust for the homeless veteran
but a little later , bobbitt 's attorney learned that the estimate was about $ 150,000 too high
as the case drags on , gofundme is working with legal counsel and investigators to ensure bobbitt gets what he 's owed , bobby whithorne , a spokesman for the company , said in a statement
gofundme has a policy for cases such as these that protects donors and beneficiaries
gofundme has given $ 20,000 to a bank account created by johnny 's legal team to provide assistance during the investigation , the statement said
as the washington post previously reported , mcclure and d'amico started the crowdfunding campaign after bobbitt came to mcclure 's rescue on the side of the road in october
mcclure had run out of gas on interstate 95 in philadelphia , and bobbitt walked to a service station and spent $ 20 of his own money to buy her gas
johnny did not ask me for a dollar , and i couldnt repay him at that moment because i didnt have any cash , but i have been stopping by his spot for the past few weeks , mcclure wrote on gofundme.
i repaid him for the gas , gave him a jacket , gloves , a hat , and warm socks , and i give him a few dollars every time i see him
mcclure and d'amico said they hoped the gofundme effort would raise $ 10,000 , but the story resonated
it was featured in national news outlets , including the post
the pair made an appearance on good morning america and were interviewed by bbc news a feel-good story at the start of the holiday season last fall
ultimately , the campaign raised more than $ 402,000 from more than 14,000 donors
but then the story took a dark turn , with accusations of mismanagement and outright theft of the money raised on bobbitts behalf
the gofundme cash , bobbitt suspected , had been squandered on vacations , a luxury car and more than one addiction
hes homeless and penniless , promislo said about bobbitt in an interview with the post last week
she added that her client wants what he wanted before a home to live in , clothes to wear and food to eat and the money that was intended for him
mcclure and d'amico could not be reached for comment thursday morning
they raised $ 400,000 for a homeless man who claims they spent it on vacations , casinos and a bmw
there are conflicting reports from the couple and bobbitt about how the money was used and whether bobbitt was a participant or a victim
mcclure and d'amico raised the money starting late last year to buy bobbitt , among other things , his own home and his dream truck a 1999 ford ranger
bobbitt met with a financial adviser but never had access to the money or signed paperwork for a trust , according to the inquirer
but bobbitt said he saw troubling signs
mcclure is a receptionist for the new jersey department of transportation , and damico is a carpenter , according to the inquirer
but suddenly , she had a new bmw , and the couple were taking vacations to florida , california and las vegas , bobbitt told the inquirer
he learned of a helicopter ride they took over the grand canyon
and bobbitt told the inquirer that damico gambled away some of the gofundme money at a casino in philadelphia
damico told the newspaper that he had indeed used $ 500 from the bank account to gamble on a night when he forgot his sugarhouse casino card but had quickly repaid the money with his winnings
the couple have denied that they used any more of the money for anything else for themselves
the inquirer reported that damico spoke of expenses that he and his girlfriend had incurred caring for bobbitt , including time that they took off from work
and damico gave an evolving account to the inquirer of how he handled the money
initially , he said he would not produce financial records because the money was put into an existing account at pnc bank that does not belong to bobbitt
on wednesday , he said he and mcclure had opened up a separate account for bobbitt
on thursday morning he said he told a reporter the trusts had been set up because thats what bobbitt wanted him to say
through it all , the money that came to bobbitt couldnt stop his addiction
he went through two unsuccessful stints in rehab that brought him no closer to being sober
some of the money that gofundme donors gave him ended up in the pockets of drug dealers , bobbitt told the inquirer
in april , six months after his fateful meeting with mcclure , bobbitt told the inquirer that he had been clean for three weeks and jobless for much longer
he told the newspaper about his addiction
bobbitts attorney told the post that he is in detox and working to get his life back
but the camper , the suv and most of the other things he got after the gofundme campaign are gone
he spent most of the summer back on the streets of philadelphia , sleeping under a bridge near the spot where mcclure 's out-of-gas suv sputtered to a stop last fall
