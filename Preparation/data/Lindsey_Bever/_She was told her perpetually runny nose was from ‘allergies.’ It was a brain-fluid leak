for years , kendra jackson battled an incessantly runny nose sniffling and sneezing , blowing and losing sleep each night
jackson said she initially thought she was getting a cold , then , as her symptoms persisted , doctors suggested it was possibly seasonal allergies , placing her among the more than 50 million americans who struggle with them each year
but the symptoms never cleared up , and , as the years went by , jackson started to worry that it might be something worse
jackson told cnn this week
it was n't until recently that jackson got some answers
earlier this year , the 52-year-old woman from omaha went to see specialists within the nebraska medicine hospital system
the specialists told jackson that she was losing an estimated half-pint of the fluid per day through her nose , according to ketv
last month , they performed a surgical procedure , going through jacksons nasal cavity to repair a tiny hole between her skull and nostrils , where her brain fluid was leaking
a spokesman for nebraska medicine told the washington post on tuesday that jackson followed up with doctors last week , and she is doing extremely well.
doctors changed diagnosis after woman said allergies were n't causing runny nose
medical experts say that csf leaks can put patients at an increased risk of infection as well as complications such as meningitis
jackson told ketv that in 2013 , she was involved in a serious car accident she was rear-ended , causing her to slam her face on the dashboard
a couple of years after the trauma , she said , she developed headaches and a runny nose , which had gotten worse the last couple years
the specialists at nebraska medicine believe that jackson 's injury may have been the result of her car accident
although many csf leaks correct themselves , sometimes they need to be repaired through various medical or surgical means
on april 23 , barnes , the lead surgeon , and neurosurgeon dan surdell at the university of nebraska medical center performed a csf leak repair , according to the spokesman for nebraska medicine
barnes said the surgical team took tissue from jacksons body and used it to plug the small hole in her cribriform plate , a very thin bone between the cranial and nasal cavities , according to cnn
csf leaks are rare , with about 5 in 100,000 people diagnosed with them each year , according to data from the csf leak association
other symptoms of cranial csf leaks , according to cedars-sinai , may include
following her surgery last month , jackson said she is getting her life back
