it was once known as the hellhole on the brazos a notorious network of sugar cane plantations and prison camps where former slaves worked and died
a tract near houston , in what is now known as sugar land , became a graveyard for many of those people it was unmarked , untouched and unconfirmed for decades
it wasnt until this year that the remains of 95 likely prisoners were unearthed in the old hellhole on the brazos , after the fort bend independent school district had broken ground there for a new school
on monday , a judge ordered the school district to halt construction and ruled that the human remains should remain at the site pending an investigation , including dna testing to identify them , according to nbc affiliate kprc
bodies believed to be those of 95 black forced-labor prisoners from jim crow era unearthed in sugar land after one mans quest
the district could not immediately be reached for comment by the washington post
it was there the former imperial state prison farm site where archaeologists unearthed an entire plot of precise rectangular graves for 95 souls , each buried two to five feet beneath the soil in nearly disintegrated pinewood caskets
the 19th-century cemetery was unmarked , with no vestige of its existence visible from the surface
this place was almost truly lost to history , archaeologist reign clark of goshawk environmental consulting told the post in june
clark said researchers have almost no doubt that the graves belong to black prisoners among them former slaves
their ages are estimated to be as young as 14 and as old as 70
the prisoners were then leased by the state to private businesses and forced to work on plantations , in coal mines and on railroads , or on state projects such as building the entire texas capitol building from scratch
in texas , the highly profitable system was notorious along the brazos river , the epicenter of the countrys sugar industry in the 19th century
photographs from the era show the prisoners in ragged striped prison clothing hoisting cane stalks from swampy fields into mule-drawn wagons and delivering them to the mills , including the imperial mill
why youve never heard of the six chinese men who survived the titanic
the prisoners chopping sugar cane , subject to whippings and beatings , were almost exclusively black , concentrated on neighboring plantations owned by former slave drivers edward cunningham and littleberry ellis
the site of the fort bend independent school districts new school and of the newly discovered graves rests on land that was ellis camp no
1 , clark said
the camp was renamed imperial state farm prison camp no
1 when the state took it over
in texas alone , more than 3,500 prisoners died between 1866 and 1912 , when lawmakers , shocked at the mortality , outlawed convict leasing , according to historian robert perkinsons book , texas tough the rise of americas prison empire.
by his calculation , that means more african americans died in convict leasing in the south in the same period than in lynchings
archaeologists clark and banks whitley had said over the summer that they intended to seek permission from the texas historical commission to complete a more detailed analysis of the bones recovered from the cemetery , such as dna testing
the ideal goal was to find descendants who could help identify the prisoners , they said
in handing down his decision monday , judge shoemake said he intends to revisit his decision by the end of march , according to local reports
