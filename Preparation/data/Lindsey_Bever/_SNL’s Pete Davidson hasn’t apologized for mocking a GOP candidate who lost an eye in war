he didnt demand an apology , but he did urge the shows writers not to use injured veterans as punchlines.

that being said , i hope nbcsnl recognizes that vets dont deserve to see their wounds used as punchlines for bad jokes
crenshaw later told tmz that he didnt necessarily want an apology
appearing monday morning on fox , crenshaw suggested that davidson and his snl colleagues consider pooling money together and donating to a veterans charity
