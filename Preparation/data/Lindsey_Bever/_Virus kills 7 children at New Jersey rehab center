seven children have died and others remain ill from a viral outbreak at a nursing home and rehabilitation center in new jersey , health department officials said
experts say the outbreak highlights the challenge of controlling infectious diseases in nursing homelike environments
adenoviruses are ubiquitous viruses that can cause a variety of illnesses , from the common cold and conjunctivitis ( pinkeye ) to more severe diseases such as bronchitis and pneumonia , according to the centers for disease control and prevention
a spokeswoman for the states health department said that at least one of the patients who died was a toddler

virus starts like a cold but can turn into a killer
the strain responsible for the outbreak in the long-term-care facility in new jersey is adenovirus 7 , known for causing pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses
the state , with help from cdc , is investigating the outbreak
health officials said in a statement that investigators have found minor handwashing deficiencies at the nursing home and rehabilitation center , which has 135 long-term-care beds and 92 pediatric beds , according to the health department
the department said it is working with the facility on infection control issues.
health officials said the center has been told not to admit any new patients during the outbreak
the wanaque center for nursing and rehabilitation could not immediately be reached for comment
according to the centers website , it offers short-term and long-term care , from physical and occupational therapies to hospice care , and has a pediatrics center for medically fragile children
amesh adalja , a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university center for health security , said that by adulthood , most people in the united states have been sickened by an adenovirus and recovered on their own
in patients with compromised immune systems , however , the viruses can be deadly
adalja noted that he does not know how the faculty in new jersey is handling the outbreak , but he said the outbreak is considered particularly severe given the high number of fatalities
there have been similar outbreaks in the past
in 2006 and 2007 , adenovirus 14 sickened at least 140 people across four states new york , oregon , texas and washington , according to cdc
nine of them died , cdc said
adenoviruses have also been a problem in military training centers , where men and women are under extreme physical and emotional stress and live in close quarters
for that reason , adalja said , a food and drug administration-approved vaccine for certain strains is given to members of the military
but when outbreaks occur , he said , it prompts questions about whether vaccines should be available to the general public
to prevent transmission , cdc recommends that people avoid close contact with those who may be ill as well as practice good handwashing techniques and avoid touching the eyes , nose and mouth with unwashed hands
there is no treatment for adenovirus , according to cdc , but the majority of cases clear up on their own
