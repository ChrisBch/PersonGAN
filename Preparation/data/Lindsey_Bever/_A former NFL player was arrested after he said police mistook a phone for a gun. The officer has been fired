a police officer in the atlanta suburbs has been fired after an internal investigation found he used unnecessary force in the arrest of a black man for possessing a firearm which in reality , the man said , was his cellphone
henry county police officer david rose was administratively charged with maltreatment or unnecessary force during the dec. 2 arrest of desmond marrow , a 30-year-old former nfl player , as well as conduct violations
chief mark amerman said in a statement posted to facebook thursday that he agreed with the investigations findings and fired rose
the statement said
henry county district attorney darius pattillo also said in a statement thursday that no felony charges would be brought against marrow
marrow had been arrested on charges of terroristic threats , felony obstruction of a law enforcement officer , reckless driving and aggressive driving
a magistrate judge already dismissed the terroristic-threats charges , and the misdemeanor charges will be turned over to a county solicitor general for review , pattillo said
rose could not immediately be reached for comment
marrow on april 26 posted a video to facebook showing what appeared to him to be three white henry county police officers taking him to the ground and pinning him down as he cried and screamed , telling them that he was not resisting
he said officers slammed him to the ground and choked him until he passed out
he wrote in the facebook post
its unclear in the video whether marrow lost consciousness
he said he also suffered a shoulder strain and a concussion
***attention*** to anyone who views this post , share like please help me get my voice heard
i was falsely arrested & taken into custody in atlanta georgia henrycounty by the henry county police
i only had my cell phone in my possession & they claimed to be scared for their lives
i had no type of weapon in my possession , i was arrested for having a gun that turned out to be my cell phone
during the arrest the police knocked my teeth out , slammed me on my head and choked me out until i was unconscious
in addition i suffered a shoulder strain and a concussion along with the heartache of my wife leaving me during this very hard time for my short comings and careless actions
this has affected me mentally and impacted my life in a way i cant even humanly describe
this isnt a cry for sympathy , i just need it to be known
my cry is for justice.they threw me into isolation and labeled me a gang member because of my tattoos
i was fully cooperating with the officers with zero resistance
i thought i was going to die
i was sure i was passing out or dying when officer d.rose was choking me as my breath kept slipping away
henry county police dept was trying to keep me quiet , but once they found out i was a former nflplayer & there was a video of the incident did they then try to drop my charges
they were basically trying to get me to sell my soul in exchange for the video not being posted and they would drop all the felonies and clear my record
they said i was resisting arrest , being out of control , spitting and assaulting the officers by head butting them
but god recorded it and i have proof
you know the truth take a lil longer to make it around lies travel faster
they locked me up & gave me no bond which gave me no voice you guys are my voice i need your help

in the facebook post , marrow asked social-media users to help give him a voice , writing , please help me get my voice heard
marrows past as a professional football player might help him do just that
marrow was listed on the preseason roster of the tampa bay buccaneers in 2012 , according to nfl.com
amerman said in the statement that the department had promised to find the truth for desmond marrow , no matter what that truth was
the investigation found that rose was recorded on his in-car video camera system saying he choked marrow but that he was not going to include that information in his report , amerman said
the investigation found that another officer , matt donaldson , acted within departmental policy , he said
wxia reported that the arrest may have been in response to an altercation between marrow and another driver
the station described a dec. 2 police report , which stated that someone in another vehicle had tossed coffee at marrows car and he chased the car into a shopping center outside atlanta
the report said that a police officer witnessed the incident and responded to the scene , where a witness said he overheard marrow threatening to shoot them , according to the station
it said that officers asked marrow whether he had a gun and he said no , and that the officers could not find one in his possession
video shows former nfl players violent arrest after he said police mistook a phone for a gun
still , the station reported , officers arrested him on the allegation that he threatened harm
its unclear when the video was filmed , but in it , a police officer can be heard warning marrow that he has a stun gun
im not even doing nothing
im not even fighting back , marrow , who appeared to be handcuffed , shouted as two officers slammed him against a white pickup truck
one of the officers held marrows arms behind his back and the other officer pulled his legs out from under him , swiftly taking him to the ground
marrow cried out as his body hit the concrete
oh , my god , he said , weeping.
i didnt even do nothing.
a bystander who appeared to be filming the scene said , thats unbelievable , man.
as marrow continued to struggle and scream at the officers , one of them pressed down on his throat
marrow made choking sounds and told the officers in a panicked , high-pitched voice , i cant breathe.
a third officer then knelt down and told him to settle down.
following the incident , one of the police officers patted him on the chest , saying , you okay
marrow wrote on facebook that he showed zero resistance during the arrest
marrow did not immediately respond to a request for comment by the washington post on thursday
the case is still being reviewed by the district attorneys office , amerman wrote
