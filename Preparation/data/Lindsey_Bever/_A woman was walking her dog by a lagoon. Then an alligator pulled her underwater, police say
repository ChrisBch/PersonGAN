cassandra cline was walking her dog along a lagoon in a resort town in south carolina when her pup ventured closer to the water , authorities said
the dog may have seen another animal in the water monday morning on hilton head island
nbc news reported that when the dog , a shetland sheepdog called kylie , got to the edge , an alligator apparently attacked in what authorities said was an extremely uncommon occurrence
beaufort county coroner edward allen told nbc news that the alligator first tried to attack clines dog and the 45-year-old woman tried to save it
then , allen said , the alligator turned on her.
during the struggle , allen said , the alligator chomped down on the dogs leash and dragged cline underwater , where she died
her dog was not harmed in the attack , authorities said
allen said , according to nbc affiliate wsav
ominous warning came days before florida woman was killed by a 12-foot alligator
officials with the beaufort , s.c. , county sheriffs office said cline , from hilton head , was suspected to have been killed by the eight-foot-long reptile
deputies responded to the scene near wood duck road in the sea pines neighborhood about 9:30 a.m. and pulled her body from the water , according to a statement from the sheriffs office
authorities are awaiting an autopsy to determine the womans exact cause of death , according to the statement from the beaufort county sheriffs office
clines mother , julia meza , told nbc news that her daughter died trying to save her dog
south carolina department of natural resources spokesman david lucas said fatal alligator attacks are extremely uncommon , especially in south carolina
lucas said that over the past four decades , only one other death from an alligator encounter has been recorded in the state
in 2016 , a 90-year-old woman found dead in a pond in charleston was believed to have been killed by an alligator , according to the post and courier
lucas said that since 1976 , there have about 20 nonfatal encounters with alligators in the state
after mondays incident , lucas said , authorities captured the alligator and euthanized it
a spokeswoman with sea pines community services associates called it a tragedy , saying the homeowners association is working with the beaufort county sheriffs office and the south carolina department of natural resources during the investigation
the department of natural resources has previously warned residents and visitors to the coastal plains to beware that alligators may be hiding in bodies of water and not to approach the animals
officials also said people should avoid swimming in water or allowing pets to swim in water where alligators are known to live , and urged people to never feed the animals because it can make them aggressive toward humans
according to a 2016 news release.
this can cause alligators to lose their natural fear of humans
in many cases , fed alligators will begin to approach at the sight of people and may become aggressive in seeking a handout
these animals will be euthanized to prevent unwanted alligator interactions
also , dont dispose of fish scraps or crab bait in the water at boat ramps , docks , swimming , or camping areas
you can inadvertently be feeding alligators.
