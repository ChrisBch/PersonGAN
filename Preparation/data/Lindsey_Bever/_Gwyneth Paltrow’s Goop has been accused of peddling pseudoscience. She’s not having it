even though the stickers had nothing to do with spacesuits at all
and coffee enemas
and vaginal steaming
and those eggs made from jade the ones that were supposed to be inserted into womens vaginas to help them get better connected to the power within.
that may not be advisable
one gynecologist called the vaginal eggs the biggest load of garbage and the green orbs ended up costing the company $ 145,000 in civil penalties last month
but when asked whether the products goop sells online are based on pseudoscience , paltrow told bbc news no
we disagree with that wholeheartedly , the actress and business executive said tuesday on bbc breakfast.
and we find that they are very helpful to people and that theres an incredible power in the human body to heal itself
gwyneth paltrows goop touted the benefits of putting a jade egg in your vagina
now it must pay
goops $ 145,000 penalties stemmed from a consumer protection lawsuit filed by 10 prosecutors across california who accused paltrows company of advertising products with medical claims that were not supported by competent and reliable science
the santa clara county district attorneys office detailed some of goops claims in a news release about the settlement
goop advertised that the jade and rose quartz eggs egg-shaped stones designed to be inserted vaginally and left in for various lengths of time could balance hormones , regulate menstrual cycles , prevent uterine prolapse , and increase bladder control
goop advertised that the inner judge flower essence blend , a blend of essential oils meant to be taken orally or added to bathwater , could help prevent depression
but when bbc news asked paltrow about goops claim that one of the products could help prevent depression , paltrow said she wanted to set the record straight
paltrow said it has been a learning experience , adding that goop now has a science and research team as well as a regulatory team to vet products
paltrow told bbc news
goop could not immediately be reached for comment
paltrows company started simply in 2008 as a newsletter telling readers where to shop , what to cook and how to better their lives
but as goop grew , so did the criticism of its medical and spiritual claims
and the controversy helped drive business , according to the new york times magazine
goop knew what readers were clicking on , and it was nimble enough to meet those needs by actually manufacturing the things its readers wanted
goop says it sold $ 100,000 of them on their first day
the weirder goop went , the more its readers rejoiced
and then , of course , the more goop was criticized by mainstream doctors with accusations of pseudoscience , by websites like slate and jezebel saying it was no longer ludicrous no , now it was dangerous
and elsewhere people would wonder how gwyneth paltrow could try to solve our problems when her life seemed almost comically problem-free
but every time there was a negative story about her or her company , all that did was bring more people to the site among them those who had similar kinds of questions and couldnt find help in mainstream medicine
