the worst wildfire california has ever seen has destroyed the once-lush forest town of paradise , leaving an unfathomable trail of death and destruction in its wake
by wednesday evening , 56 people had been confirmed killed by the camp fire , making it the deadliest wildfire in state history
dozens of people are still missing , so authorities expect that the death toll will continue to rise
the fire also destroyed nearly 7,000 structures , most of them homes
no california wildfire has ever done more damage
the camp fire started on nov. 8 near pulga , a small community surrounded by the plumas national forest
high winds and dry conditions sent the flames raging through paradise , a city of 27,000 nearly 90 miles north of sacramento
now , the city is in ruins , leaving most residents who survived without homes and businesses , a community that has all but disappeared
one fire official said it resembled armageddon
a resident said the devastation looked like iraq.
