sorry kids , no more all-day pajama parties , cartoon marathons and snowball fights when youre really supposed to be in school
a school district in south carolina has done away with the much-loved snow days requiring students to do classwork online
the simple fact is , though , that south carolina has very little snowfall each year
what does it take to call a school snow day
a lot of frantic emails
the superintendent said the school district invested $ 11 million in chromebooks over the past several years , providing them to students in kindergarten through 12th grade , so we think were in a position to make it work.
still , wilson , the superintendent , said school district officials are working to determine how many children lack internet access at home and how many younger children may have trouble accessing online assignments
he said younger children may be given assignments , such as reading , that to do not require computers
wilson said he understands that there are always outliers and that the students who are unable to complete their assignments at home will be given five days to make them up once they return to school
when asked whether he had received any pushback from parents or outraged children he said the response had been mostly positive , but he added that he expects more questions when the students return to school next month
