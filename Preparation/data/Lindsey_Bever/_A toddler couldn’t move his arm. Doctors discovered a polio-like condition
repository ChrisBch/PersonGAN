when orville young ran up to his mother , elaine young , to give her the mail , she noticed he was using his non-dominant hand
it was not until nearly two weeks later when everyone else was on the mend and orville had come down with a fever that she started to worry
young said she was planning to take her son to the doctor the morning of july 12 when she noticed that her right-handed toddler was using his left hand
his right arm , she said , was hanging at his side
i was panicked , she said during a phone interview monday with the washington post
she said she called out to a neighbor , shouting that her son was paralyzed and that she needed someone to watch her daughter while she rushed him to the emergency room
then she called her husband , frantic , and told him what happened
young said she had been reading about the condition since it started making headlines in 2014
in july , her son became one of the first children diagnosed in the recent cluster in minnesota
a mysterious polio-like illness that paralyzes people may be surging this year
since the cdc began tracking afm in 2014 , 362 cases have been reported in the united states , 38 of which have been reported across 16 states this year
it prompted the minnesota department of health to put out an alert last week , stating that over the past several weeks , six cases have been reported in children across the state
mdh disease investigators are working aggressively with health care providers to gather information about the cases
the department is also in contact with the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) to share information
for reasons not fully understood , afm affects mainly children
all recent minnesota cases have been in children under 10 years old and all were hospitalized
cases have been reported from the twin cities , central minnesota and northeastern minnesota
there was a national uptick in afm cases in 2014
disease investigators believe this was linked to an outbreak of a respiratory illness in children that was caused by a virus known as enterovirus d 68 ( evd68 )
minnesota saw three afm cases that year
since then , we have typically seen less than one case a year
the cdc states that afm targets the spinal cord , which can lead to weakness in the muscles
symptoms can include facial-muscle weakness , seen as droopiness issues moving the eyes or droopy eyelids issues swallowing or slurred speech
in rare cases , the cdc stated , it can cause numbness , tingling and pain in the extremities , problems urinating , paralysis , respiratory failure , and death
marc patterson , a pediatric neurologist at the mayo clinic , told the post that , like polio , afm is caused by enteroviruses a collection of viruses that typically cause mild symptoms , such as stomach problems , or no symptoms at all
in some patients possibly those with genetic predispositions these viruses can invade the nervous system , leading to conditions such as afm
patterson said that there is no vaccine to guard against enteroviruses ( except for polioviruses ) and that treatment for afm is simply supportive treatment
after a diagnosis , he said , doctors may prescribe physical therapy to help with recovery and , in some cases , surgery to help repair nerves
asked why it seems that afm cases have been climbing across the united states in recent years , patterson said that there may be a number of factors.
he said it could be that the viruses are mutating to be better able to invade their hosts , or it could be that doctors are now better able to recognize the signs
more cases reported of a mysterious polio-like illness that killed a 6-year-old
young , from minneapolis , said she had heard about afm during a 2014 cluster in california , where she and her family lived at the time
in july , young said , doctors in the emergency room in minneapolis told her that her son was probably suffering inflammation from a virus and tried to send them home
but then , she said , the doctors decided to admit the toddler and do an mri exam
she said the spinal images confirmed her fears afm
her son was given steroids for several days and then released from the hospital , she said
at its worst , young said , her son could not move his right shoulder , elbow or lower arm he would wiggle his fingers , but they were weak
he also lost muscle control in his torso , leaning to one side because he was unable to hold himself upright , young said
and because his right leg also had become weak , his parents had to hold him up as he tried to walk
young said her son is still struggling to use his right arm but he wants to so badly that he holds items in his right hand and then uses his left arm to move it
looking back on it all , young said that it was isolating and scary.
young said orville is thought to be the first child diagnosed with afm in the recent cluster in minnesota , so she and her husband had no one who could relate to what they were going through
after the ordeal , she said , she started reaching out to other parents in the state to let them know that the young family understood
we want them to know that theyre not alone , young said
