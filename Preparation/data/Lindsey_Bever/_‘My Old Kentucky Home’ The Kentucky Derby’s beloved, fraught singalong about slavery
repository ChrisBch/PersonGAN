the tradition of playing the song on derby day dates to at least 1921 , although its not clear when it became part of the parade of horses and jockeys at the start of the race at churchill downs
the derbys official history explains
on a rainy saturday , as race winner justify and the 19 other horses headed to the gates , it happened again at the 144th running of the kentucky derby
the crowd sang along , a scene captured by nbcs television cameras
many people belting out the lyrics or the millions who listened at home had no idea that the history behind the song is so fraught
justify wins the 144th kentucky derby , pulling away on a sloppy , rain-soaked churchill downs track
my old kentucky home is the state song of kentucky
it was written before the civil war by american songwriter stephen foster , who is considered the father of american music.
the song has made appearances in gone with the wind and the simpsons and been recorded by artists including al jolson , bing crosby , marian anderson and louis armstrong
but last month , the city of pittsburgh , fosters home town , removed a statue of him with a black man sitting at his feet , singing and strumming the banjo
the pittsburgh post-gazette reported
defenders said that it simply showed foster listening to a song by a black musician
foster , who wrote minstrel music now seen as racially offensive , is remembered for oh
susanna , hard times come again no more and old folks at home ( or swanee river )
hunting down runaway slaves the cruel ads of andrew jackson and the master class
in a 2010 interview with npr , music critic ken emerson , who wrote a biography of foster , said my old kentucky home was inspired by the anti-slavery novel uncle toms cabin.
the song goes like so
the sun shines bright in the old kentucky home , tis summer , the darkies are gay the corn-tops ripe and the meadows in the bloom , while the birds make music all the day
the young folks roll on the little cabin floor , all merry , all happy and bright by n by hard times comes a-knocking at the door , then my old kentucky home , goodnight
they hunt no more for the possum and the coon , on meadow , the hill and the shore , they sing no more by the glimmer of the moon , on the bench by the old cabin door
the day goes by like a shadow oer the heart , with sorrow , where all was delight , the time has come when the darkies have to part , then my old kentucky home , good night
in 1986 , the kentucky general assembly passed a law replacing the words darky and darkies with people.
the altered lyrics are the ones now sung at churchill downs
former kentucky poet laureate frank x walker told npr in 2016 that the song is more than a state anthem
