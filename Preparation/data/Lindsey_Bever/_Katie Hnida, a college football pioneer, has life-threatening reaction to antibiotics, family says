katie hnida , who made u.s. history as the first woman to play and score in division i-a college football , has suffered a life-threatening reaction to antibiotics , her family says
hnida , an athlete-turned-advocate for survivors of sexual assault , became ill in september after taking an antibiotic often prescribed for a common illness , her father , dave hnida , told the washington post
he said thursday in a phone interview that hnida had an adverse reaction that caused her kidneys and liver to start shutting down and her bone marrow to stop functioning properly
after weeks of treatment , including emergency dialysis , hnida is stable and expected to recover in the coming months , though her father called her prognosis cautious.
to this day , people call me a liar a campus rape victims story , 10 years on
hnidas father did not explain why his 37-year-old daughter was prescribed the antibiotics in september but said that within days she had become seriously ill
hnida said his daughter was taken to a hospital , where doctors learned that she had almost no platelets , meaning her blood would not clot
hnida was admitted into the intensive care unit , where she underwent treatment
he said that hnida was in the hospital for weeks , though he did not name the hospital or say where it was located
his daughter is now making a very slow recovery at her family home in the denver area , hnida said
in 2003 , she kicked two extra points in a game against texas state university , according to her website
but in 2004 hnida made headlines for a different reason
the college football player had came forward with sexual assault allegations against a former teammate at the university of colorado boulder during a time when the team was embroiled in controversy over accusations that it had used alcohol and sex to impress recruits
hnida told sports illustrated that she was a virgin when a teammate raped her in 2000
a decade later around the same time as rolling stones debunked story of a gang rape at the university of virginia but before the metoo movement hnida told the post that people were still calling her a liar
she said in 2014
'the attention you get as a rape victim is not fun , its awful
following news of hnidas illness , jacque may , equipment operations manager at the university of new mexico who knew hnida when she was a student athlete , told the santa fe new mexican she was a wonderful teammate.
ive been around a long time and i can tell you , she was a wonderful teammate , she added
according to a gofundme page set up for hnidas family , hnida will be unable to work for four to six months while she completes rehabilitation
the page has raised more than $ 11,000 to help cover her medical expenses and lost wages
hnidas father said he is extremely grateful for what his daughter has done and hopes she will be able to continue her advocacy work
