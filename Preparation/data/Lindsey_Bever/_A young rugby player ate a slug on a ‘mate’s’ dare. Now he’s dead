sam ballard swallowed the slug on a dare
the young rugby player from sydney was a larrikin a rough-and-tumble free spirit , his mother said
so when the creature crawled across a table at a party in 2010 and his buddies dared him to eat it , her son accepted the challenge , she said
his mother , katie ballard , told 7 news sydney in an interview the following year.
boys will be boys , she said
the dare may have been innocent enough
but after swallowing the slug , ballard contracted a rat lungworm a parasitic worm ( angiostrongylus cantonensis ) that lives in rodents and can be passed onto snails and slugs , according to the centers for disease control and prevention
those gastropods can then transmit the worm to humans
in an unusual and tragic turn , the parasite infested ballards brain putting him into a coma for more than a year and leaving him paralyzed , according to news.com.au
ultimately , it killed him
ballard , 29 , died late last week , according to the sunday project
his last words to his mother were , i love you , according to the australian news show

the parasitic worm angiostrongylus cantonensis lives inside rodents lungs
as the cdc explained in a video , the rodent typically a rat coughs up the worms and then swallows them , forcing them into the animals stomach
eventually , the rat excretes the worms
snails or slugs can become infected by eating the rats feces , according to the cdc , and people can become infected by eating the snails or slugs
according to the cdc
people can get infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite
in some cultures , snails are commonly eaten
some children , in particular , have gotten infected by swallowing snails/slugs on a dare.
people also can get infected by accident , by eating raw produce ( such as lettuce ) that contains a small snail or slug or part of one
certain animals such freshwater shrimp , crabs , or frogs , have been found to be infected with larvae of the parasite
it is possible that eating undercooked or raw animals that are infected could result in people becoming infected , though the evidence for this is not as clear as for eating infected snails and slugs
of note , fish do not spread this parasite
cases have been reported in hawaii , as well as in the continental united states , according to the cdc
a new orleans boy contracted the parasite in 1993 by eating a snail on a dare , according to the agency , but did not need treatment
australian health officials have called it an extremely rare infection.
the new south wales ministry of health said in a fact sheet that most people who contract it do not experience any symptoms when they do , the symptoms are usually temporary and mild , the health agency said
according to the ministry
very rarely , rat lung worm causes an infection ( infestation ) of the brain called eosinophilic meningo-encephalitis
people with this condition may have headaches , a stiff neck , tingling or pain in the skin , fever , nausea , and vomiting
the time between eating the slug or snail and getting sick is usually 1-3 weeks
anyone with these symptoms should seek medical assessment although other infections ( such as meningococcal disease or pneumococcal disease ) are much more likely causes of meningitis in children
health officials warn people not to eat raw snails or slugs and to thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables and inspect them for the slimy creatures
