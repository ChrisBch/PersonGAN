there dylan is playing cards with bill.

in another photo online , the 12-year-old with autism is seen talking to his two animals outside in georgetown township , mich
earlier this year , dylan even drew a picture of a duck and wrote an acrostic , defining his feathery friends as determined , undefeatable , caring and kind
these ducks are his everything , his mother , jen dyke , told nbc affiliate wood.
theyre his whole life.
thats why dylans parents said it was so upsetting earlier this summer when neighbors began to complain about the animals , which mark and jen dyke said provide emotional support for their son
it prompted officials in the township , near grand rapids , to order them to remove the ducks , saying they violated an ordinance against keeping farm animals in the neighborhood , according to the station
but after an emotional fight , dylans parents announced that members of the georgetown township zoning board of appeals said dylan could keep his friends
it looks like dylan will get to keep his ducks
the dykes wrote wednesday on a facebook page called dylans duck adventures , where they have been chronicling their sons relationship with his beloved pets
the family could not immediately be reached for comment friday afternoon by the washington post
service and support animals explained
the news comes months after georgetown township officials sent a letter to the dykes , informing them that the ducks must be removed from the property
another complaint stated that the animals violated the homeowners associations bylaws , adding that residents were forced to smell and look at duck waste , hear quacking and look at a messy pen
the complaint added
this is where nibbles and bill live , behind the latticework under the deck
we have a small outside area made of thin ...
wood reported that the dykes filed for an ordinance variance to try to keep their sons pets and their fight gained international media attention , with people from all over pledging support for dylan and his ducks
the board of directors for the cory estates association told wood it was aware of the familys request
the board said last month in a statement to the station
therapy animals are everywhere
proof that they help is not
on wednesday , according to wood , dozens attended the board meeting to determine the ducks fate , some wearing t-shirts to show support
one person who had complained said it was not about dylan
we love dylan , maggie phillips said , according to wood
its unclear whether dylans ducks have received special training to assist him or whether they are simply pets that he relies on for emotional support
dylans psychologist , eric dykstra , told wood that the ducks are important to the boys well-being and dykstra recently wrote a letter explaining that they are considered emotional support animals
they provide the opportunity for him to calm down
they provide the opportunity for him to practice emotional regulation , he told the station.
for dylan these ducks are extremely helpful.
after wednesdays announcement , the dykes said dylans story has given them the opportunity to advocate for people with special needs , writing on facebook that they are fortunate that we found something that works for dylan
he still struggles with many things , but nibbles and bill help him
is our hope that you find what works for you , and if there is anything we can do to help please let us know
as for dylan , he said that the ducks just get him
