rick scott was chased away from a campaign event by demonstrators criticizing him for the toxic algae bloom that , for many months , has been killing marine life and apparently triggering respiratory issues among some residents
the herald-tribune reported that scott , the gop candidate for u.s. senate in the state , was confronted by angry protesters monday at mojos real cuban restaurant in venice , about 80 miles south of tampa , where dead animals have been washing ashore
protesters crowded outside the restaurant holding signs reading redtide rick and calling the governor a coward forcing him to enter and , only minutes later , leave , through the back door , according to the newspaper

residents told the herald-tribune that florida has been plagued by an extreme amount of toxic algae and although its not scotts fault , he has been exacerbating it
at issue , according to the newspaper , is the governors multimillion-dollar budget cuts to environmental agencies
in fact , politifact reported that during scotts first term in 2011 , he cut $ 700 million in funding from floridas water management oversight
some argue that had the state had that funding , it could have taken steps to lessen the effects of the toxic algae bloom , according to the herald-tribune
the algae , karenia brevis , releases toxins that can attack the central nervous system in animals and can cause skin , eye and respiratory irritation in people , according to a fact sheet from floridas department of health
the fact sheet says that when the algae occur in large numbers , called blooms , its commonly known as a red tide for the reddish-brown color that it turns the ocean water
as the washington posts alex horton reported
a red tide is a natural phenomenon that develops miles offshore before making its way to the coast , where it feeds on a variety of pollutants , including phosphorus and nitrogen from fertilizer , along with other runoff and wastewater
the toxins can aerosolize in the wind that drifts ashore , triggering respiratory problems or worsening conditions such as asthma
what is not clear is whether climate change and pollution from humans near the shore has made this outbreak severe and prolonged
scientists have found that the algae thrive in warmer waters and increased carbon dioxide levels
the red tide prompted the governor to issue a state of emergency last month across seven counties along the states southwestern shore , promising to provide $ 1.5 million in emergency funding
scott did not speak about the issue or anything else at the rally monday in venice , according to the herald-tribune
