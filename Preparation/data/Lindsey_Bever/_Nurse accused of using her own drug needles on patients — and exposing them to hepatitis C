a washington state emergency room nurse has resigned and her license has been suspended after accusations that she exposed patients to hepatitis c by stealing narcotics and using her own needle to administer their medication
officials with the state department of health said monday that cora webergs nursing license has been suspended due to alleged diversion of controlled substances.
authorities said weberg , a 31-year-old former nurse at multicare good samaritan hospital in puyallup , has admitted to diverting fentanyl and hydromorphone , narcotic pain medications
police also said that two patients who were under her care in the emergency department in december 2017 were later admitted to the hospital and tested positive for hepatitis c , according to a statement from the health department
the statement read
but weberg , who was arrested late last week on two counts of second-degree assault , has denied the allegations
she said she does not believe she is a contagious carrier.
after her arrest , weberg was released from custody pending further investigation in the case
the disturbing reason behind the spike in organ donations
the hospital has recommended that those who may have been exposed to hepatitis c undergo testing , which the hospital said it will provide at no cost
webergs attorney , bryan hershman , could not immediately be reached for comment tuesday but told the news tribune that his client has denied accusations that she infected the patients
hepatitis c is a blood-borne virus that attacks the liver and is most often contracted by sharing needles or other intravenous drug paraphernalia , according to the centers for disease control and prevention
according to the cdc
the cdc states that most people with the virus eventually develop long-term infection in fact , an estimated 3.5 million people in the united states have chronic hepatitis c , according to the agency
the cdc says
the news tribune reported that in march , local health officials opened an investigation into the infections
the tacoma-pierce county health department , which monitors such cases , connected the infected patients to each other and then to weberg , who treated the patients
health department experts , relying on information from the national centers for disease control and prevention , established that the tests revealed a conclusive link between the two patients and the genetic sources of the virus
the link to weberg was less clear , health department leaders found
the viral material from webergs tests was limited and insufficient to show a conclusive genetic link to the patients , though she tested positive for the disease
during a news conference last week , multicare good samaritan hospital president chris bredeson apologized to the patients who had been exposed
