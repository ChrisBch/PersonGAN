a georgia police officer has resigned after an aggressive confrontation in which he shouted a profanity at a 65-year-old grandmother while trying to arrest her , police said
legg , who was initially suspended during an internal investigation , said friday that he was stepping down , explaining that he did not think he would get a fair ruling
he wrote in his resignation letter , according to abc affiliate wsb.
it worked instantly and she exited the vehicle immediately
the police department did not immediately respond , and legg could not be reached for comment by the washington post
a port authority official berated and cursed at officers during a traffic stop
a dash cam was on
the video shows officers pull over the woman , identified as rose campbell , for failure to maintain a lane on windward parkway in alpharetta , about 30 miles from atlanta
it was unclear friday whether campbell had been formally charged with a crime
the officer who conducted the traffic stop explained to her why he had pulled her over , issued her a citation and asked her to sign it
when she would not comply , the officer opened the door and instructed her to step out of the car
campbell remained in the vehicle but , several minutes later , agreed to sign the citation
then she appeared to close the door on the officer , hitting him in the shoulder
get out of the car , the officer said , attempting to pull campbell from the vehicle
he told her she was under arrest for disorderly conduct and she replied , no , im not
another officer quickly arrived on the scene and tried to assist the arresting officer still , the two struggled to get campbell to exit
she repeatedly screamed for a supervisor , saying she was being abused
maam , come on out of the car
one of the officers said , as the two appeared to pull on her
legg then approached the scene , walking up behind the two other officers and observing briefly before shouting and cursing at campbell , who had just appeared to agree to comply with the officers
she stepped out , looked at legg and responded , who are you talking to
you
legg then appeared to aggressively pull campbells arm behind her back to handcuff her and campbell let out a series of screams , still asking for a supervisor
during this particular stop , you will see that the driver became so upset that she struck the officer with the door of her vehicle
she was then told that she was under arrest and , after she refused to obey the officers lawful order to step out of the vehicle , the officer attempted to physically remove her
as youll see , this was a complicated issue due to the age of the driver as the officer did not want to hurt her
backup was requested and available officers responded to the scene , some of which responded to handle traffic control along windward pkwy
one officer in particular however , interjected himself into the situation using language and tactics that were inappropriate , even inflammatory
again , this officers behavior does not reflect who we are as an organization and , because of this , we have initiated an internal affairs investigation
our process allows us to thoroughly review the matter and determine what actions are appropriate moving forward
campbell told wsb that when the first officer pulled her over and gave her a citation , she asked , for what
as the situation escalated , campbell said , she felt violated.
during the arrest , campbell told wsb , she felt ganged up on.
but legg said , given the circumstances , he acted appropriately
he wrote in his resignation letter
