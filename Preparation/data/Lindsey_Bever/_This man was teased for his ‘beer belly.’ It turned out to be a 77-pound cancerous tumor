warning this story contains a graphic image of a 77-pound tumor
it seemed that each pound was going straight to his gut
hector hernandez said he has always been a big guy , so he did not notice a problem until a couple years ago when his arms and legs seemed to be getting smaller , while his stomach was getting bigger
the 47-year-old from downey , calif. , said that he also started struggling with heartburn and constipation and noticed that , at times , he had a hard time catching his breath
at 300 pounds , he said , strangers had started to stare , and friends were cracking jokes about his beer belly , even though he said he rarely drank the beverage
when he first mentioned the issue to a physician , he said , the doctor brushed him off , telling him some people just carry weight differently than others
i just thought i was fat , hernandez said in a phone interview on tuesday with the washington post
she kept gaining weight and didnt know why
it turned out to be a 50-pound ovarian cyst
but hernandez said his stomach kept feeling heavy and hard to the touch , so he got a second opinion
ultimately , he said , he was diagnosed with a retroperitoneal liposarcoma , a rare but cancerous tumor that forms in fat cells , according to the mayo clinic
doctors dont know when the tumor started growing
but it weighed 77 pounds , according to his surgeon
hernandez said he did not know how to feel about the tumor or the surgery needed to remove it
at first , he said , he was shocked and confused but also relieved that he finally knew what was wrong
he said , noting they are raising funds to help with his recovery.
i finally left it in gods hands.
tseng , who specializes in sarcomas , said that throughout his career , he has surgically removed dozens of them , which typically are between 20 and 30 pounds
this is probably the largest one ive removed , he told the post , speaking about hernandezs tumor
during an hours-long surgery over the summer , tseng removed the massive tumor , which he said had spared hernandezs major blood vessels and most organs , though he had to cut out a kidney that had suffered damage
tseng said that bleeding is the biggest risk associated with the surgery and that patients can die on the operating table but that there were no complications in hernandezs case
the surgeon said hernandez will not need to undergo chemotherapy or radiation but that , because liposarcomas often return , hernandez must have periodic follow-up scans to monitor the situation
i was really lucky , hernandez said
now , hernandez said he feels totally different more energetic and many , many pounds lighter
though , he said , he is still not 100 percent.
