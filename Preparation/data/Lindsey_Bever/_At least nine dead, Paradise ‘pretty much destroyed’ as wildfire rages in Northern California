but the fire was spreading rapidly , its growth sped by abnormally hot , dry and windy conditions that had prompted official warnings up and down the fire-prone state
within a half-hour , the hospital , adventist health feather river , sent out an alert across its loudspeakers that warned of the impending emergency , kicking off a fevered scramble to evacuate the hospitals patients and staff before the flames subsumed the town
patients , including many on gurneys or in wheelchairs , were loaded in waiting ambulances , police cars , even some nurses vehicles as the staff worked to evacuate , loney said
within a few hours of the hospitals evacuation , many of the buildings on its campus were destroyed , with a makeshift medical station set up on a nearby helipad left eerily untouched
the story was not unique
residents across the area , in butte county about 90 miles north of state capital sacramento , described fleeing a catastrophic fire that grew with incredible speed and turned a sunny day into an end-of-days scene of flames , smoke , sparks and wide destruction
and the camp fire , named for a nearby creek , was not yet done
a state emergency , it had burned at least 90,000 acres , more than 140 square miles , and was only 5 percent contained by friday night
officials warned about hot , dry and windy red flag conditions persisting on and off through monday
it had injured an undisclosed number of residents as well as three firefighters
and honeas deputies were still looking into some 35 reports of missing people
this event was the worst-case scenario , honea said.
its the event that we have feared for a long time
hundreds of miles south in ventura county , still reeling from a mass shooting that left 12 people dead , more wildfires had broken out , causing the evacuation of 100,000 people in thousand oaks , malibu and other areas
the woolsey fire had burned some 35,000 acres , officials said , while the nearby hill fire had burned through 6,000
the weather and climate behind the inferno that wrecked paradise
but of all the areas struck by fires in the state so far , paradise had fared the worst
its main commercial street transformed into a smoking runway of destruction
officials said that 6,453 homes and 260 businesses had been destroyed , making the fire the most destructive in californias history
the previous record holder , the tubbs fire in the states wine country , was just one year ago
stories of hope did emerge from the frightening swirl of chaos and devastation
the adventist health feather river was eventually evacuated in its entirety , loney said , calling it one of the most horrific but also amazing things , shed ever seen
patients had been funneled out of the hospital through the emergency room with attention to the level of care they required
there were people who had recently been in surgery , she said
newborns thrust back into the hands of their mothers
patients with breathing or feeding tubes
but getting out of the hospital was just the beginning of the evacuation
the two-lane road next to the hospital was choked with traffic , as the crush of cars fleeing the encroaching flames had slowed to a crawl
street signs shimmered in the dancing orange light of the fire
everything was engulfed
and the traffic was hardly moving
loney said , describing two people who exited their cars and started running
she called her brother , wondering if it was the last time shed speak to him
others described similarly harrowing escapes
marc kessler , 55 , a science teacher at a public middle school in paradise , said the sky turned black soon after he arrived at work
he said in an interview.
within minutes , the town was engulfed.
teachers were told by emergency workers to forgo seat-belt laws as they piled 200 or so students into their personal vehicles
bus drivers drove through flames to help out , he said
one of his students pointed out what they thought was the moon in the darkened sky
other residents , like mike kirby , 62 , made other plans after seeing the clogged roads
the lifelong paradise resident had woken to the unnatural darkness outside at 8:30 a.m. , and loaded up his trailer
he ended up parking in a cemetery in town a large area of green , he said , where he felt he had room to move if he needed to , despite warnings from fire crews
i was totally surrounded at one point , he said
he spent the night there safely the cemetery was relatively untouched
fast-moving wildfires threaten homes in southern california , forcing thousands to flee
the rest of the town , which has a large community of retirees , did not fare as well
people returning friday arrived to find much of it destroyed
houses lay in ruins along the road , which was littered with the hulls of burned-out cars that had been ditched , and other debris
the strip of businesses downtown that included a burger king , a valero gas station , a jack in the box and small businesses had been reduced to charred ruins
breaking we have arrived in downtown paradise and im so sorry to report ... much of the town has been lost , along with hundreds of homes
nearby neighborhoods were wiped out as well
for every building that survived , there were dozens that did not
mayor jody jones told reporters that about 80 percent of the homes in town had been burned
officials said that they did not yet have a complete death count because of the hazards caused by the fire
in addition to paradise , the nearby communities of magalia , pulga , concow , butte valley and butte creek canyon were also under evacuation orders
a total of 52,000 people had evacuated officials said nearly 1,400 were in shelters
the harrowing push to flee that so many residents described one made even more tenuous because of the traffic pointed to questions about whether more planning or infrastructure is needed in an era of catastrophic fires in the state
scott lotter , a paradise town council member , said it took him nearly two hours to go a half-mile as he evacuated with his wife , daughter and son-in-law , as well as a pet rabbit and two dogs
these abandoned and burned out cars shows you what a panic it must have been for residents trying to escape the camp fire
unreal scenes in paradise , ca , this morning
in less than a year , california has seen its record for largest fire broken by the 282,000-acre thomas fire in ventura and santa barbara counties in december
that record was shattered in july when the mendocino complex fire claimed 460,000 acres
and five of the states 10 most destructive fires measured by the number of buildings destroyed have occurred in the past 10 years
stephen pyne , a wildfire expert at arizona state university , said the destruction of the town of paradise was a grim sign of the potency of modern wildfires in california
officials said friday morning that an evacuation order had also been issued for stirling city and inskip , as the national weather service warned that strong winds and low humidity could create critical fire weather.
the fire started thursday near pulga , a small community surrounded by the plumas national forest , officials said
the first firefighters to arrive found 10 to 15 acres burning amid wind gusts of nearly 50 mph
kessler , the teacher at paradise intermediate school , said more than 100 of the students were taken to chico , where they were reunited with their family members
he read an email to the washington post from one of his students
the email said , according to kessler.
i cant stop crying im having anxiety attacks.
rick prinz , of paradise , who has been the varsity football coach for paradise high school for the past 20 years , said his players were all accounted for but were going through the same thing
officials said that schools in the county would be closed through nov. 23
in chico , a college town of about 93,000 about six miles from paradise , officials had watched the blaze wearily
the national weather service had predicted dangerous fire weather in california because of santa ana winds , which roar in from the east and accelerate down californias north-to-south-oriented mountain slopes
red-flag warnings for critical fire weather conditions were in effect not only for the sacramento valley but also through central and southern california
gusts of 50 mph were expected in many locations
about 23.4 million californians were still under red-flag warnings early friday , though the winds were expected to ease , giving emergency responders more advantageous conditions for battling the blaze
kessler said the fire felt like a battle
it felt like we were under attack with no warning , he said
