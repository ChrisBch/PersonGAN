in the years leading up to his death , notorious boston mob boss james whitey bulger wrote about his regrets in life
bulger , imprisoned for life for his role in 11 murders , penned a letter to three teenage girls in 2015 , telling them that he was a 9th grade dropout who took the wrong road.
the former mobster said he was among societys lower , best forgotten members
he told the students , who had first written to him for a project for national history day , not to spend their time on him
he wrote , according to the boston globe
the bureau of prisons confirmed that bulger , 89 , died tuesday
he was found unresponsive at a penitentiary in bruceton mills , w.va. , though details about his cause and manner of death were not immediately known
whitey bulger , boston crime boss and elusive fugitive , dead in prison at 89
the three high school students michaela arguin , mollykate rodenbush and brittany tainsh , then juniors in lakeville , mass
decided to build their project around bulger , the former boss of bostons notorious winter hill gang
arguin said that the theme was leadership and that , rather than choosing a positive leader , they chose a negative one , asking bulger what he thought about his own legacy
bulger , no doubt , had a troubled life
as the washington posts paul duggan reported , bulger , from a poor family in boston , started stealing when he was young
by the 1950s , he was robbing banks
by the 1970s and 1980s , he was heading his infamous gang , known for fixing horse races , among other crimes
although notorious in boston , mr. bulger was largely unknown to the wider world until after he disappeared in 1994
in his absence , his darkest secrets , including his corrupt ties with fbi agents , were gradually laid bare in court hearings , media exposs and a congressional inquiry
he became a nationwide curiosity , sharing space with osama bin laden on the fbis 10 most wanted list
captured in santa monica , calif. , in 2011 , mr. bulger was sentenced to two consecutive life terms plus five years after a boston jury convicted him of 31 racketeering offenses
the indictment against him catalogued 19 alleged murders , and he was found guilty of ordering or carrying out 11 of them
the verdicts , in 2013 , climaxed a gangland opera of fealty and betrayal that spanned half a century and combined two of bostons abiding fixations ethnic crime and politics
but on feb. 24 , 2015 , bulger replied to the students letter from federal prison in sumterville , fla. , declining to participate and urging the teenagers to find a more deserving subject , such as a wounded service member
bulger also talked about his brother , william bulger , whom he called a better man than i.
his brother was a former president of the massachusetts senate as well as the university of massachusetts but was pressured by then-gov
mitt romney to resign from the university in 2003
arguin , one of the students who wrote to bulger , said in 2015 that his response was shocking.
she told the boston globe at the time.
it was kind of weird we kind of had an impact on him , three high school girls
you wouldnt expect that
but more than three years later , arguin said she feels the same way
she told the post on tuesday after the news that bulger had died in prison
still , arguin said , she was most stuck by his advice
its something you wouldnt think a mob boss would say , arguin said
arguin , who said she is a pre-law student , said she has taken bulgers suggestion and plans to go to law school perhaps to study criminal law
