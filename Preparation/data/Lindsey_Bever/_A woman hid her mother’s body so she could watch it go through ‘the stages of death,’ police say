a north carolina woman is accused of keeping her 93-year-old mothers dead body so she could watch it decompose
authorities said tuesday donna sue hudgins , 69 , hid her mothers body in their home in enfield , not far from raleigh , for several months before she told family members , friends or the funeral home her mother had died
hudgins told police the reason she did not tell anyone was because she was curious and wanted to see the stages of death , according to a statement from the enfield police department
hudgins was arrested and charged with concealment of death , a felony
a spokeswoman with the halifax county detention center said wednesday hudgins has since been released on bond
it is not clear whether she has an attorney
tourists stumbled upon a car crash then saw the driver drag a body into the woods
her funeral was scheduled for the following week , according to the obituary
although it is unclear when , authorities said it all came to light when hudgins went to a funeral home to make arrangements
hudgins apparently told funeral home personnel she was not sure where the paramedics had taken her mothers body and , when the personnel were not able to track it down , they called police , according to the statement from the enfield police department
asked about the incident , wheeler & woodlief funeral home director kemp david said he could not disclose details but confirmed the funeral home made arrangements for the service and burial
when authorities went to hudginss home , they found a badly decomposed body , according to the statement from police
police said the body had been in the home for several months
kenny velasquez , who is separated from nellie hudginss granddaughter , told nbc affiliate wral that when relatives tried to see or talk to the 93-year-old woman during that time , hudgins would not allow it
officials with the enfield police department did not immediately respond wednesday to a request for comment from the washington post , but said in the statement they would not be providing further comment on the case
