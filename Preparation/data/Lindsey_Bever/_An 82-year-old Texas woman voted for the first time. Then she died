when 82-year-old gracie lou phillips returned from early voting last week in north texas , she danced a little jig around her walker , then sat down and raised her fists into the air , her family said
i voted
until then , phillips , from grand prairie , had never cast a ballot the result of misapprehension about voting and her belief that she didnt have a voice , her family said
but her son-in-law , jeff griffith , said that in recent years , voting had become extremely important to phillips , and she wanted to have a say in the 2018 midterm elections
so despite being gravely ill , phillips cast her first ballot during early voting thursday in grand prairie
on monday , she died
phillips was a beautician her husband , bill , worked in construction
in addition , he did not want them to be political for fear that it might sway business , the family said
but after watching the elections in recent years , griffith said , his mother-in-law wanted to participate
she registered to vote , but then she became ill with pneumonia and sepsis , griffith said
still , he said , while phillips was in the hospital , she kept talking about the election
it was really important to her.
he added that when she got home , she kept insisting.
a reporter unwittingly left a voice mail for a gop candidate
she was fired for what she said
so thursday afternoon , phillips , who was in hospice care , went to the polls a church near her home
phillips , who was on oxygen , stayed in the vehicle and poll workers brought her a paper ballot , griffith said
when she finished filling it out , he said , they clapped and cheered
a video from her family showed phillips sitting in the vehicle , holding a souvenir pen and a sticker
i voted today , she said , reading the words printed on the seal
but the next morning , phillips was unable to get out of bed or to drink her morning coffee , her family said
she died just before 2 a.m. monday , with her daughters by her side , but her vote having been logged
in phillipss congressional district , democratic rep. eddie bernice johnson , the incumbent , won reelection
she was very happy , griffith said about his mother-in-law.
she kept saying she finally got to vote.
