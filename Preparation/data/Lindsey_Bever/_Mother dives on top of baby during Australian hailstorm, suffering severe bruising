fiona simpson and her grandmother were driving back from an appointment when it started to rain
the 23-year-old had not heard the weather reports , so she did not know that a superstorm was quickly approaching thursday in queensland , australia
she had decided to take her grandmother and her 4-month-old daughter to a coffee shop for the afternoon , she told australias the project.
but the rain got heavier , and then it started to hail blowing out a back-seat window of simpsons vehicle and putting her infant in danger
without thinking , simpson said , she unlatched her seat belt , jumped into the back seat and threw her body over the baby , trying to shield the child from the icy pellets that were pouring into the vehicle
now simpson , from kingaroy , queensland , has massive bruises covering her back and arms
simpson could not immediately be reached for comment friday morning by the washington post

she said she had hoped it would pass quickly , but the storm only got worse
simpson said she unbuckled her daughters seat belt , picked her up and tried to pass her to her grandmother so she would be safe , but , at that moment , her grandmothers window blew out as well

then , she said , she tried to cover her grandmother
she told the abc
