amid a mounting controversy over supreme court nominee judge brett m. kavanaugh , who faces numerous sexual misconduct allegations , supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg applauded the metoo movement
ginsburg addressed law students at georgetown university on wednesday , just hours before a senate judiciary committee hearing at which kavanaugh and one of his accusers , christine blasey ford , will be questioned about her allegations of sexual assault
ginsburg did not mention kavanaugh by name , reuters reported , but told the students that she was cheered on by metoo
the 85-year-old jurist said , according to reuters
but now , she said , women are speaking out together about their experiences
she told the students.
so women nowadays are not silent about bad behavior.
ginsburg has previously shared her own metoo story , telling live audiences this year about an encounter in college
i was in a chemistry class at cornell , she said in february at the national constitution institute.
i was not very adept in the laboratory , so a teaching assistant decided to help me out so much that he offered to give me a practice exam the day before the actual exam
when i went into the room and looked at the exam paper , i found that it was the practice exam
her conversation with national constitution center ceo jeffrey rosen , republished in the atlantic , began with a question about metoo , a movement ginsburg said she never saw coming
