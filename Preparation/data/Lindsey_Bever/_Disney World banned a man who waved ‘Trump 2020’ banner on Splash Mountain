dion cini calls his photos at floridas walt disney world resort guerrilla marketing.
one picture shows the 49-year-old with a slight smile , holding a trump 2020 banner on the splash mountain log ride
another shows him on a roller coaster , holding a sign that reads keep america great
his plan , he said , was to go viral , drawing support for president trumps campaign
according to newsweek , in the past several months he has also unfurled pro-trump banners on broadway and at yankee stadium to show his support for the president
but , he said , it was his campaigning last week at the disney theme park that became an issue and got him banned from all disney properties , including theme parks and resorts , for inciting a crowd

a disney spokesperson said in a statement that the issue was not with the guests political views but that he repeatedly violated park rules by waving banners
according to the parks policies , guests are prohibited from organizing demonstrations or speeches , using any flag , banner or sign for commercial purposes or inciting a crowd
the policies also state that any item disney deems harmful or disruptive is not permitted
the statement read.
we have previously reminded this guest about our rules.
the orange county sheriffs office , which reportedly responded to the incident , did not immediately provide information to the washington post
impeach trump banner hung by protesters at nationals park after opening day win
it started in september when cini , a trump supporter , hung a massive trump 2020 banner outside disneys main street railroad station
cini claims he was banned from disney but was later told he could return if he agreed not to incite a crowd
after he used the two pro-trump signs last week , he said , he was banned again
he wrote on facebook.
they hate my signs , or the president
maybe both
disney said that the guest was not banned in response to the incident in september but that his ticket was paused so park staffers could have a conversation with him about the policies and procedures
when he broke the rules again last week , he was trespassed , disney said
in any case , cini said he knew the photos showing him with pro-trump banners would go viral and he was counting on it , saying it was his way to contribute to the campaign
he said he believes that trump is doing a better job than any president ive ever seen.
one person can have a bigger voice than a thousand people , he added
after his recent photo-ops , cini said he has gotten a wide response from people some expressing appreciation and some sending death threats
when he posted about it on facebook , many people commented on his personal page , calling him a super hero and saying that the stunt was his best one yet.
however , some pointed out that a sign could be a hazard on a fast-moving ride
and others noted that many people go to theme parks to escape the world , not be confronted by it
as for his banishment from disney , cini said he intends to fight it in court
