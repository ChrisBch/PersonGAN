xavier cunningham and his buddies were climbing into a treehouse when a wasp landed on his hand
the children had stumbled into a massive yellow jacket nest saturday afternoon in a neighbors treehouse in western missouri , and xavier , who was at the top of the ladder , tried to swat one of them away
but in the process , xaviers stepfather said , the 10-year-old lost his balance and fell face-first to the ground right where he and his friends had stuck a long metal meat skewer they had found
he fell down on it , shannon miller said about his son , explaining how the skewer impaled the young boys cheek and drilled through his skull
miller said , adding that xavier got up covered in yellow jackets with a long rod protruding from his face and started running toward his house , wailing , get them off me
get them off me
xaviers surgeon said the skewer entered the boys face under his eye and traveled several inches through his skull , but it did not puncture the skin at the back of his head and it missed all his major arteries
a 12-year-old had one-sixth of his brain removed
he feels perfectly normal
miller said he was not home at the time
xaviers mother rushed him to a hospital near their house in harrisonville , about 40 miles from kansas city
miller said doctors there told them that they were not equipped to handle such an injury and the boy was taken by ambulance to childrens mercy hospital in kansas city and then to the university of kansas hospital
while xaviers medical team worked to devise a plan , miller said he and xaviers mother stayed up all night , praying and singing and watching the boy sleep to make sure that he didnt pull the metal skewer out of his face
that was the hardest part , miller said
he said xavier would sleep only minutes at a time , then wake up in a panic , asking , am i dead
am i still alive
on sunday morning , he went into surgery
the second priority was to get the skewer out as cleanly as it had gone in
the surgeon added that the skewer did puncture one of xaviers jugular veins but that it had closed the wound , keeping the boy from bleeding
he said it barely missed everything , calling the scenario one in a million.
an army of surgeons specializing in ear , nose and throat ( ent ) neurosurgery , pediatrics , trauma and more , worked hours to remove the skewer
ebersole said the team made an incision on the side of xaviers neck to expose the vessels so they could be ready to control any bleeding , then using x-ray imaging , slowly started to pull out the rod
he said , but after an inch or so , it started to move more freely.
and the surgeons were able to remove it
ebersole said xavier will be sore for a while and may experience some voice changes because the skewer was so close to his vocal cords , but the surgeon does not foresee any significant impairment
and the image of the skewer piercing through xaviers skull
its flabbergasting , ebersole added
miller , the boys stepfather , said when xavier woke up from surgery sunday afternoon , the first thing he asked his parents was , is it out
is it out
is it out
miller said he credits xaviers medical team and god for his sons survival
xavier is still recovering in the hospital , but is expected to go home this week
