less than a week ago , leilani estates was the picture of serenity on hawaiis big island , a subdivision in the islands eastern puna district filled with wooden homes nestled in tropical plant-filled lots
the latest eruption of the islands most active volcano changed everything
shortly after kilauea erupted thursday , the ground split open on the east side of leilani estates , exposing an angry red beneath the lush landscape
from the widening gash , molten rock burbled and splashed , then shot dozens of feet in the air
the hawaii county civil defense agency called it active volcanic fountaining
some residents insisted it was pele , the hawaiian volcano goddess , coming to reclaim her land
residents were ordered to flee amid threats of fires and extremely high levels of dangerous sulfur dioxide gas
soon , another such fissure had formed a few streets to the west
then another , and another
from the vents , hot steam and noxious gases rose , before magma broke through and splattered into the air
as of monday morning , 10 such fissure vents were reported in the neighborhood and at least 26 homes and another nine structures had been destroyed , emergency officials said
that number could change , hawaii county spokeswoman janet snyder told the associated press
this is heartbreaking
the u.s. geological survey said some of the lava was shooting 330 feet into the air higher than the tip of the statue of liberty torch
active venting of lava and hazardous fumes continue in leilani estates , the civil defense agency said monday , noting that residents of the evacuated subdivision will be allowed to check on their properties during the day
but , the agency warned be prepared to evacuate at a moments notice
the fissures are forming along a northeast-southwest line in the rift zone , and not all of the older fissures are actively spewing lava , said wendy stovall , a volcanologist with the usgs
as the eruption progresses , there will become a preferred pathway for the magma to go through , stovall said
some of the outer vents along this fissure line will start to close up and congeal because the lava is going to essentially harden
once that happens , lava fountains from the remaining open vents can shoot even higher reaching up to 1,000 feet , stovall said
more outbreaks are likely to occur along the rift zone , officials said
drone footage showed lava spouting along the fissures that had formed , creeping toward leilani estates homes and leaving lines of smoldering trees in their wake
the flows destroyed or cut off several streets in the neighborhood , typically home to about 1,700 people before most of them evacuated last week
meanwhile , over the past few days some photographers have followed the fissures , posting dramatic photos and videos of lava spattering into the air or oozing across roads
officials have urged everyone to leave leilani estates , where a mandatory evacuation order remains in force
being in hawaii and being around lava , you get used to the way it behaves and so you kind of become comfortable around it , stovall said
the lava flows are mesmerizing to see
i understand why people want to see them but its not advisable
its a dangerous situation
the county civil defense agency put it more bluntly in an advisory sunday please , the residents of leilani need your help by staying out of the area
this is not the time for sightseeing
this is a very fast-moving situation , hawaii county mayor harry kim told hawaii news now
this is unfortunately not the end
when kilauea erupted thursday , it sent fountains of lava gushing out of the ground and billowing clouds of steam and volcanic ash into the sky on the eastern side of the island
three days later , some residents there continue to suffer through a triple whammy of threats
from below , lava has spewed forth from an increasing number of fissures that have opened up in the ground , oozing toward homes
several earthquakes including the strongest to hit hawaii in more than four decades have jolted the big islands residents , some as they were in the midst of evacuating
temblors have rattled the big island at regular intervals over the past several days including 18 between 6 p.m. sunday and midnight local time another struck early monday
and in the air , noxious fumes from the volcano are what some officials say could be the greatest threat to public health in the wake of its eruption
after the eruption thursday , the island shook at regular intervals , but especially about midday friday a 5.6-magnitude quake hit south of the volcano about 11:30 a.m. , followed about an hour later by a 6.9-magnitude temblor , according to the geological survey
the latter was felt as far away as oahu and struck in nearly the same place as a deadly 7.4-magnitude earthquake in 1975 , according to the geological survey
videos posted to social media showed homes visibly shaking , items clattering to the floor at supermarkets and waves forming in swimming pools as the quake rattled
i think the whole island felt it , said cori chong , who was in her bedroom with her foster dog , monty , when the earthquake struck , frightening both of them
even though chong lives on the hamakua coast , about an hour north of the earthquakes epicenter , the shaking in her home was so violent that it caused furniture to move and glass to shatter
david burlingame , who lives about two miles west of leilani estates , told the washington post that he and a friend ran outside when the earthquake hit and watched my house just shake back and forth
everybody is kind of on edge , burlingame said saturday of both the potential for additional earthquakes and the unpredictability of the lava flows
the worst part is kind of waiting to see , because you really never can tell what can happen

the earthquakes also prompted the rare closure of hawaii volcanoes national park after they damaged some of the parks trails , craters and roads
the first earthquake triggered a cliff to collapse into the ocean , and fissures began to appear in the ground at a popular overlook near the jaggar museum
park officials said they canceled hikes friday and evacuated about 2,600 visitors , along with all nonemergency employees
safety is our main priority at hawaii volcanoes national park , and it is currently not safe to be here , park superintendent cindy orlando said in a statement
we will monitor the situation closely , and reopen when it is safe to do so
the county civil defense agency reported that the threat of a tsunami was low after the earthquakes , although officials warned that residents were not in the clear
everything is still elevated , civil defense agency administrator talmadge magno said , according to hawaii news now
it kind of gets you nervous
thursdays eruption prompted the county of hawaiis managing director , wil okabe , to issue a state of emergency declaration
david ige ( d ) also issued an emergency proclamation and activated hawaiis national guard to help with evacuations
please be safe , sen. brian schatz ( d-hawaii ) wrote on twitter
jordan sonner , a big island realtor , was on another part of the island taking pictures for an upcoming listing thursday when she got the call that there was lava in leilani and rushed back to her home just outside leilani estates
to describe it in a single word chaos , sonner said of the evacuation in an interview with the post on saturday
my immediate threat was not the lava
it was the sulfur dioxide gas
it took sonner about an hour and a half to reach her home , grab important documents and her pets four dogs and a chinchilla and scramble back out , she said
shes now staying with a friend in mountain view , about 20 miles northwest of leilani estates , and expects it could be a long while before its safe for residents to return
its so hard to tell what is going to happen because its just so early
this volcano being a shield volcano , the way that it erupts , it just erupts slowly , sonner said
we kind of just have to sit and wait to see what direction the lava is going to flow in and what other fissures are going to open up
this is far from over
when asked whether she was afraid she would lose her home , sonner paused before describing the uniqueness of the community there
the way i kind of look at it is , the land doesnt really belong to us
it belongs to pele , sonner said , referring to the hawaiian volcano goddess
we get to live on it while we can , and if she wants it back , shell take it
i have good insurance
gabbard warned that , in some ways , the threat from the sulfur dioxide gas could be more dangerous than the lava flows , which had stopped in places after the eruption
if conditions worsened , even first responders would not be able to go into the affected neighborhoods to help trapped residents , she added
sulfur dioxide gas can be so toxic and thick in some areas that it can be fatal , especially to those who have respiratory illnesses , gabbard said
kilauea is the youngest and most active volcano on hawaii island , according to the usgs
the eruption from the volcano came hours after a 5.0-magnitude earthquake jolted the island thursday morning
as the posts sarah kaplan reported , kilauea is made of basalt , a fluid lava that makes for effusive rather than explosive eruptions
rather than building up into a steep , towering peak like krakatau in indonesia or mount st. helens in washington state , the fluid rock at kilauea creates a broad , shallow dome known as a shield volcano
shield volcanoes are really voluminous , the largest volcanoes on earth , but because they have those long , low-angle slopes , theyre not very dramatic , said tari mattox , a geologist who worked at the hawaii volcano observatory for six years
people are surprised when they go to hawaii and they say , wheres the volcano
and i tell them , youre standing on it
rocks moving upward through the mantle beneath hawaii begin to melt about 50 miles beneath the surface
that magma is less dense than the surrounding rock , so it continues to rise until it ponds in a reservoir thats roughly three miles wide and one to four miles beneath the summit
as pressure builds in the magma chamber , the magma seeks out weak spots in the surrounding rock , squeezing through the earth until it reaches a vent to the surface
geologists said the seismic activities around puna most closely resemble the events that precipitated a 1955 eruption , according to hawaii news now
that eruption lasted about three months and left almost 4,000 acres of land covered in lava , the news site reported
more recently in 2014 , lava again threatened the puna district , specifically the town of pahoa and its surrounding area , the post reported
during that event , lava flowed as quickly as 20 yards per hour , and up to 60 structures were at risk
