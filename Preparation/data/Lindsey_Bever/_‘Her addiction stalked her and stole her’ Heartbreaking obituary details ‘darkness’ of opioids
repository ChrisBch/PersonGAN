twelve days at home with her loved ones
twelve days watching childrens movies and chatting around the dinner table
twelve days madelyn ellen linsenmeir remained mostly sober after a years-long on-again , off-again relationship with opioids
twelve days that gave them all hope
a family member wrote.
we believed this until the moment she took her last breath
the details come from a heartbreaking obituary one of linsenmeirs relatives apparently wrote earlier this week , opening up about the 30-year-olds devastating fall into addiction
it said linsenmeir , from burlington , vt. , died oct. 7 while she was home with her family but it is the raw and emotional way the obituary portrayed the circumstances leading up to her death that has resonated with others
why this father didnt hide his daughters heroin overdose in her obituary
a voice that took her around the world and at 16 , she and her parents moved from vermont to florida so she could attend a performing arts high school
it was there , however , her life started to crumble
to some , maddie was just a junkie when they saw her addiction they stopped seeing her
and what a loss for them
because maddie was hilarious , and warm , and fearless , and resilient
she could and would talk to anyone , and when you were in her company you wanted to stay
the family could not immediately be reached for comment by the washington post
after linsenmeirs obituary was published gaining widespread media attention a police chief in her hometown said he had a problem with it
burlington ( vt. ) police chief brandon del pozo wrote wednesday on facebook , according to the burlington free press
del pozo said many others like linsenmeir have died as a result of opioid addictions
