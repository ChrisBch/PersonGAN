following hundreds of lawsuits over the years against pharmaceutical giant purdue pharma , colorados attorney general is suing the oxycontin creator for its significant role in causing the opioid epidemic.
the lawsuit claims purdue pharma l.p. and purdue pharma inc. deluded doctors and patients in colorado about the potential for addiction with prescription opioids and continued to push the drugs
and it comes amid news that the companys former chairman and president , richard sackler , has patented a new drug to help wean addicts from opioids
oxycontin and our opioid crisis how the misleading marketing of one pain pill helped get america addicted
according to the statement from the colorado attorney generals office
but purdue pharma vigorously denied the accusations friday in a statement to the washington post , saying that although it shares the states concern about the opioid crisis , it did not mislead health-care providers about prescription opioids
in 2016 , there were more than 63,000 drug overdose deaths in united states , and more than 66 percent of them were attributed to opioids , according to the most recent data from the centers for disease control and prevention
the cdc states that both illegal opioids and prescription opioids , which are commonly used to treat pain , have been associated with addiction , overdoses and death
then earlier this year , the wall street journal reported that purdue planned to stop promoting the drug
now , it seems , a new business venture is only adding to the outcry
the financial times reported that sackler , whose family owns purdue pharma , a multibillion-dollar company , patented a new drug earlier this year that is a form of buprenorphine , a mild opioid that is used to ease withdrawal symptoms
however , some are expressing outrage that the sacklers , who have in essence profited from opioid addictions , may soon be profiting from the antidote
the patents description acknowledges the risk of addiction that is associated with opioids
while opioids have always been known to be useful in pain treatment , they also display an addictive potential in view of their euphorigenic activity
thus , if opioids are taken by healthy human subjects with a drug seeking behaviour they may lead to psychological as well as physical dependence
these usually undesired characteristics of opioids can however become important in certain scenarios such as drug substitution therapies for drug addicts
the constant pressures upon addicts to procure money for buying drugs and the concomitant criminal activities have been increasingly recognised as a major factor that counteracts efficient and long-lasting withdrawal and abstinence from drugs
the patent states that the drug could be used both in drug replacement therapy as well as for pain management
