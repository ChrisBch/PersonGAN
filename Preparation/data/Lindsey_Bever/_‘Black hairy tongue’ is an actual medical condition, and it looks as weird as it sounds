do not panic , but there is a medical condition in which a person 's tongue can take on a dark , woolly appearance and it is appropriately called black hairy tongue
doctors in missouri diagnosed a 55-year-old woman with the condition last year after she reported feeling nauseated and having a foul taste in her mouth and a black , hairy-looking tongue , according to a study published thursday in the new england journal of medicine
yasir hamad , lead author of the study and an assistant professor in the department of internal medicine at the washington university school of medicine in st. louis , said the condition is relatively rare
it affects anywhere from .06 percent to 13 percent of the population , according to official estimates , and varies by region
i 've been practicing in the u.s. for the last 10 years , and this is literally the first case i 've seen , hamad said thursday in a phone interview with the washington post
why dont we treat our teeth as if they are part of our overall health
hamad said the case in st. louis was the classic , textbook case of black hairy tongue
luckily , black hairy tongue , or lingua villosa nigra , is typically painless and temporary
the mayo clinic says the condition is sometimes caused by antibiotics which can alter the bacteria and yeast in the mouth tobacco , certain diets and excessive quantities of coffee , tea and alcohol as well as poor oral hygiene
in the winter 2017 , hamad diagnosed the patient with black hairy tongue about a week after she began taking antibiotics for an infection
it was very dramatic , hamad said about the appearance.
the tongue was literally black
the woman , who was not publicly identified , had developed an infection after both of her legs were crushed in a severe car accident , according to the study
the study states the patient was treated with two antibiotics , one of which , minocycline , belongs to a class of antibiotics that has been associated with the condition
hamad said he determined minocycline was probably the culprit so took her off the medication , and he advised her to practice good oral hygiene
within several weeks , he said , it cleared up
as scary at it is , it is actually benign , hamad said about the medical condition.
it does n't cause any health problems , and it is reversible
hamad advised people who have similar symptoms not to worry and to consult their doctors
he advised physicians to be aware of it and to be sure to pay attention to patients mouths during examinations so that they can recognize it
