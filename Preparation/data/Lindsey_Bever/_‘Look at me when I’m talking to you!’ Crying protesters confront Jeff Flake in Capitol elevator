one woman , who said she had been sexually assaulted , shouted during a live cnn broadcast as flake was making his way to a senate judiciary committee meeting
the center for popular democracy , a left-leaning advocacy organization , later identified her as the groups co-executive director , ana maria archila
this is horrible , she told flake.
you have children in your family
think about them.
analysis kavanaughs evasive testimony probably wouldnt have been allowed in his own courtroom
another woman then chimed in , telling the senator that she had also been sexually assaulted and that no one believed her story
she said as the tv cameras rolled
youre just going to help that man to power anyway , she added , weeping.
thats what youre telling all of these women
thats what youre telling me right now
flake listened quietly , then told the women thank you.
a tweet from immigrant rights group make the road action identified the second woman who confronted flake as maria gallagher and showed a photo of her standing with archila
a woman claiming to be gallagher later published a tweet with the same image
these two heroes , who confronted jeffflake this morning , just changed the course of the kavanaugh process
weyou so much , anamariaarchil2 and maria gallagher
the american bar association had kavanaugh concerns 12 years ago
republicans dismissed those , too
in his statement , issued at 9:25 a.m. washington time , roughly six minutes before the confrontation , flake said that thursdays emotional senate judiciary hearing had not persuaded him that kavanaugh sexually assaulted christine blasey ford in the 1980s
i will vote to confirm judge kavanaugh , flake concluded
but that wasnt all
when the senate judiciary committee voted to send kavanaughs confirmation out of committee and to the full senate , flake announced that his support for kavanaugh hinged on an fbi investigation and said that he would not vote to confirm kavanaugh without it
chris coons fights back tears defending jeff flake we share a deep concern
the confrontation was hardly the first time in which tensions over this supreme court nomination have boiled over on capitol hill
the night before following the testimony of christine blasey ford , the woman accusing kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when the two were teenagers sen. lindsey o. graham ( r-s.c. ) was similarly confronted by protesters in front of the cameras
earlier , he had excoriated senate judiciary committee democrats , saying , boy , you all want power
god , i hope you never get it
i hope the american people can see through this sham
you had no intention of protecting dr. ford none
as graham was walking and talking to fox news about the hearing calling the way kavanaugh was treated despicable and saying that he also felt bad for ford protesters followed him and heckled him
graham ignored them , pausing only briefly to tell a reporter , these people can yell all they want to
he then resumed the interview , attempting to speak over their shouts
lindsey graham moments ago on fox ( with protesters yelling behind him ) these people can yell all they want to
does n't matter
i believe him
as the posts reis thebault reported , graham and republican senators mike lee and orrin g. hatch were doxed thursday when their personal information including their phone numbers and home addresses , were leaked to the public
graham said friday on fox & friends that people were banging on his front door thursday night and that he had to get a new phone number
