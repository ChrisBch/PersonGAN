the hawaii county civil defense agency reported that the threat of a tsunami was low following the earthquakes
kilauea first erupted thursday , sending white , billowing clouds of steam and volcanic ash into the sky and prompting emergency officials to order mandatory evacuations
authorities warned residents to stay out of the area friday as molten rock shot high into the air from cracks in the ground in leilani estates , a subdivision in the puna district , on the eastern side of the island
the civil defense agency said there was active volcanic fountaining in the neighborhood , meaning the lava was springing up from ground fractures reports indicated it was shooting 80 to 100 feet into the sky
the geological survey said at least six fissure vents have opened in the subdivision so far and that more outbreaks are likely to occur along the rift zone
no significant lava flows have yet formed , the geological survey said
but at least two homes in the leilani estates subdivision caught fire , hawaii news now reported
about 1,700 people live in leilani estates
as kilauea roared to life , the deafening sound of grinding rocks echoed in the air , and fiery red-orange lava could be seen spurting from the ground
residents were ordered to evacuate to nearby community centers serving as shelters , and the states department of education announced that several schools would be closed due to volcanic activity.
a state of emergency was issued by the county of hawaiis acting mayor , wil okabe , and gov
david ige ( d ) issued an emergency proclamation and activated hawaiis national guard to help with evacuations

less than an hour after the eruption began thursday , wailing warning sirens joined the cacophony , maija stenback , a resident of leilani estates , told the washington post
as dramatic as the sights and sounds are , the eruption and lava flow pose little threat to peoples lives , thanks to a monitoring and alert system in place for years
kilauea is the youngest and most active volcano on hawaii island , according to usgs
the eruption from the volcano came hours after a 5.0-magnitude earthquake jolted the island thursday morning
since monday , the area has been rattled by at least 600 smaller quakes generated by magma flow from kilauea , janet babb , a geologist with the hawaiian volcanoes observatory , told the post
osuna told the post , adding that it was nerve-racking not knowing exactly where the eruption would occur
the event has been building for several days , babb said , and the tremors were a sign that magma could break through the surface any time
and sent a large plume of ash into the air , the usgs reported
the collapse began monday as magma , which supported the crater , moved out and down the rift zone , triggering the quakes , babb said
when stenback got a call from her son that the volcano had started erupting , it felt unreal , she said
it wasnt until she and her daughter saw lava coming up through the ground that she believed it
once you see it , then you know its really happening , said stenback
she added that she even hesitated to pack because she didnt think the eruption would occur
but after seeing and filming the lava , stenback said , she and her daughter rushed back home to prepare to evacuate
in addition to collecting legal documents and medication , stenback said , she quickly grabbed sentimental pieces from her jewelry box and stuffed the items into the pockets of her shorts because she didnt have time to properly pack her suitcase
she said her family will stay with friends in hilo , about 25 miles away , until it is safe for them to return
many residents took to social media to share photos and videos of the eruption
on twitter , one person wrote , omg my island is on fire and included a video of lava gushing from the middle of a road
since 1983 , kilauea has erupted frequently , many times forcing nearby communities to evacuate
geologists said the current seismic activities around puna most closely resemble the events that precipitated a 1955 eruption , according to hawaii news now
that eruption lasted about three months and left almost 4,000 acres of land covered in lava , the news site reported
more recently in 2014 , lava again threatened the puna district , specifically the town of pahoa and its surrounding area , the post reported
during that event , lava flowed as quickly as 20 yards per hour , and up to 60 structures were at risk
in comparison , thursdays eruption seems more tame , as the usgs reported that lava spatter and gas bursts erupted for about two hours and the lava spread less than 33 feet from the fissure
according to a statement released from the service shortly after 10 p.m. local time
however , babb said the inactivity doesnt mean the event is over , and there is no way to forecast how long the eruption could last
early friday morning , civil defense also said that the fire department had detected extremely high levels of dangerous sulfur dioxide gas in evac area.
the areas bordering the eastern part of the rift zone , kim said , are at high risk for eruption.
for now , residents dont know when it might be safe for them to return to home
