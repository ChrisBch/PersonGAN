amid increasing tension over the sexual assault allegations against supreme court nominee brett m. kavanaugh , donald trump jr. said he is more concerned for his sons than for his daughters
president trumps eldest son , who has five children , was speaking about the recent allegations of sexual assault in an interview with dailymailtv , which is scheduled to air as a two-part series monday and tuesday , according to the daily mail
looking at his childrens futures , he seemed to be worried that perhaps one day , his sons might face false accusations of sexual misconduct
ive got boys and ive got girls , he told the british tabloid , and when i see whats going on right now , its scary
when asked whether he was more worried about his sons or daughters , he said , right now , id say my sons
the other problem , he added , is that for people who are real victims of these things , when it is so obviously political in cases like this , it really diminishes the real claims
a spokesman for trump jr. would not provide a comment monday to the washington post about those remarks
kellyanne conway says kavanaugh accuser should not be insulted after trump jr. mocked her
trump jr. has been vocal amid the recent discussions and debates about allegations of sexual misconduct and assault
just two weeks ago , he posted a meme on social media that appeared to be mocking christine blasey ford , one of kavanaughs accusers
ford has accused kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers , and the judge has denied the allegation
oh boy ... the dems and their usual nonsense games really have him on the ropes now
finestein had the letter in july and saved it for the eve of his vote ... honorable as always
i believe this is a copy for full transparency
a post shared by donald trump jr. ( donaldjtrumpjr ) on sep 15 , 2018 at 12:30pm pdt
the meme showed a picture of an apparent schoolboys love note , which was written in crayon and read hi cindy will you be my girlfriend
it included two boxes , one for yes and one for no , and it was signed , love bret
it appeared to be mocking a confidential letter that ford sent over the summer to sen. dianne feinstein ( calif. ) , the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary committee , detailing her allegations against kavanaugh
oh boy the dems and their usual nonsense games really have him on the ropes now , trump jr. wrote , claiming that feinstein had saved the letter and released it just in time for the confirmation vote
honorable as always , he added
during fords and kavanaughs testimonies last week at a hearing before the committee , trump jr. appeared to question ford
im no psychology professor but it does seem weird to me that someone could have a selective fear of flying
cant do it to testify but for vacation , well its not a problem at all
he then showed support for kavanaugh , saying that he loved the judges tone which has been characterized as volcanic
i love kavanaughs tone
its nice to see a conservative man fight for his honor and his family against a 35 year old claim with zero evidence and lots of holes that amounts to nothing more than a political hit job by the dems
others in the gop should take notice
during the recent interview with dailymailtv , trump jr. 's girlfriend , former fox news channel host kimberly guilfoyle , said that sexual assault accusers should be heard , but that their claims should be scrutinized
i think its important , in terms of doing an investigation , to get the facts out there and find out , she said
its very tough 35 years later , but it doesnt mean it should be ignored
people need to be careful to understand the politics involved as well , and what motivations people may have , she added
