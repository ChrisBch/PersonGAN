a massachusetts mayor has taken a pledge of sobriety at least when it comes to samuel adams brews after the beer companys co-founder jim koch praised president trump for his contentious tax cuts
somerville mayor joseph curtatone , a democrat , made a sobering declaration sunday on twitter i will never drink sam adams beer again
no more winter lager
no more summer ale
no more rebel grapefruit ipa sigh
opinion craft beer is booming
is that bad news for the u.s. economy
it all started when koch , co-founder and chairman of the boston beer co. , which produces samuel adams , met with the president
he said , according to a transcript from the white house
thats right , trump said
trump wow
but youve done a great job
when somervilles mayor got wind of kochs remarks , he got all hopped-up and threatened to boycott the business executives beer
then he addressed koch
hey jim koch
while you were thanking trump for your tax break , did you happen to express any concern for the families separated under his cruel and inhumane immigration enforcement policy
boston beer and the mayors office did not immediately respond to requests for comment
however , the internet had plenty to say and some of it was comical
would rather toss a mayor into harbor
though some people on social media supported curtatone , many were more critical of the mayors stance
never , ever take that samueladamsbeer you showed them mayor
more your speed ...
