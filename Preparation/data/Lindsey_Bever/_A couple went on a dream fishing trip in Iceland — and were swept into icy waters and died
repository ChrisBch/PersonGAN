veit told her family about her biggest catch a six-pound brown trout , her sister , patrice veit , told the minneapolis star tribune

although there are conflicting reports about who went in first , veits sister wrote monday in a facebook post that the u.s. embassy in iceland told family members that veit was swept away and that schumacher entered the lake to save her
