an arizona man conned caregivers into providing sexual gratification for him , telling them that he had down syndrome and needed assistance with bathing and going to the bathroom , authorities said
authorities said paul anthony menchaca posed as his own mother online and told potential caregivers that he ( she ) needed help with his ( her ) special-needs son
between january and september , police said , the 31-year-old hired at least three caregivers , all of them women , to bathe him and change his diapers
the caregivers later told police that when they performed the tasks , menchaca was sexually aroused , sgt
darrell krueger , a spokesman for the gilbert police department , told the washington post
in some cases , krueger said , menchaca would ask them to clean it better.
menchaca was arrested last week and charged with 10 counts of sexual abuse and three counts of fraudulent schemes , police said
he is being held without bond
it was not immediately clear friday whether menchaca has an attorney
a serial sexual predator posed as a ride-service driver so he could hunt and rape women , police say
court documents show that menchaca , of gilbert , ariz. , near phoenix , posted an advertisement on the home-care website carelinx.com under the name amy , claiming that amy had a then-30-year-old son who needed special assistance
krueger , with the gilbert police department , said that menchaca lives with his parents but added that his parents did not seem to be aware that their son was running such a scheme
krueger said that menchaca would sometimes have the caregivers meet him at restaurants or coffee shops and then change his dirty diapers in public restrooms
one caregiver told investigators that she cared for menchaca about 30 times , bathing him and changing his diaper and each time he had an erection , according to a probable cause statement
the caregiver said there were several instances in which menchaca aggressively said he was not clean enough , forcing her to continue touching him , according to the court records
two other caregivers gave similar statements
eventually , the first caregiver became suspicious , according to the court documents
the documents state that the three women , who all knew each other , had been communicating with amy only through text messages and were receiving payments through their smartphones
so earlier this month , she followed him home , knocked on the door and met his parents
authorities said menchacas parents confirmed to investigators that their son does not have down syndrome and does not require special assistance
in court , menchaca claimed that he has a low iq level.
he told the judge , according to fox affiliate ksaz
after the allegations , investigators searched menchacas bedroom at his parents home and found his cellphone , computers and other electronic devices that had apparently been used to create accounts online , according to the court records
they also found diapers
