maureen pacheco had expected to have a spinal procedure
it was april 2016 , and she was told a surgeon would fuse together a couple of vertebrae in her lower back to help relieve pain believed to be from an injury she sustained in a car accident the previous year
however , when she woke up from surgery at wellington regional medical center in wellington , fla. , she learned that the surgeon had done something else , according to court records
during the spinal procedure , the surgeon , ramon vazquez , had allegedly noticed a mass in pachecos pelvis , suspected that it was a cancerous tumor and cut it out , according to an administrative complaint from the florida department of health
it turned out it wasnt a tumor
it was one of pachecos kidneys
pachecos attorney , donald ward , told the palm beach post
ward could not immediately be reached by the washington post
'damaged for the rest of my life woman says surgeons mistakenly removed her breasts and uterus
pacheco sued the surgeon last year , claiming that vazquez and others were medically negligent when vazquez unnecessarily removed a fully functioning kidney
the lawsuit was settled in september for a nominal amount , the surgeons lawyer , michael mittelmark , told the post
however , mittelmark said that his client did not admit liability and does not think he did anything wrong.
vazquez is a general surgeon in west palm beach
according to the states board of medicine , he has an active license with no record of discipline on file
wellington regional medical center said in a statement friday that , at the time , vazquez was an independent physician with privileges at the hospital but is not and has never been an employee.
although its better to have two functional kidneys , most people can live normal lives with only one , according to the national kidney foundation
however , in some cases , having only one can lead to problems later in life , such as an increased risk of high blood pressure
leading up to the spinal surgery , pacheco had undergone two magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) tests , which revealed she had a kidney located in her pelvic region , according to the lawsuit
by failing to perform a radiology review or even inform pacheco before removing one of her organs
as a result , according to the lawsuit , pacheco has suffered bodily injury and resulting pain and suffering , disability , disfigurement as well as mental anguish.
the health department requested that the board consider suspending or revoking the surgeons medical license or put him on probation
