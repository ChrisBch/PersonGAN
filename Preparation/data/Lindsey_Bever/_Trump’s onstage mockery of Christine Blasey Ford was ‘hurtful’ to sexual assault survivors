following the explosive allegations and the tearful testimonies and adamant denials president trump stood on stage at a political rally in the deep south and openly mocked the woman at the center of an extremely public sexual assault scandal
trump said tuesday night , ridiculing christine blasey fords testimony at a recent senate judiciary committee hearing , where she answered questions regarding the sexual assault allegations against supreme court nominee brett m. kavanaugh
i dont remember , he repeated during his impersonation
trumps remarks ignited an uproar on capitol hill and beyond , as politicians called his words appalling and vile and accused the president of dividing us into tribes.
but at issue is not exclusively what the president said during the rally in southaven , miss
its that he said it at all
advocates for sexual assault survivors argue that society and especially leaders should be working to help put an end to sexual violence
the white house did not respond to a request for comment
trump mocks kavanaugh accuser christine blasey ford
terri poore , policy director for the national alliance to end sexual violence , a nonprofit group based in washington , said trumps actions were the absolute opposite of what is needed from leaders
poore said that advocates , activists and survivors have been working for decades to make progress regarding sexual violence and trumps recent behavior marked a new low point
in the united states , it is estimated that someone is sexually assaulted every 98 seconds and that a child is victimized every eight minutes , according to statistics from rainn
that means that millions of men , women and children have been victimized in america and poore said that the presidents words were tremendously hurtful to them
she said , referring to trumps remarks
ford recently spoke out against kavanaugh , who she alleges sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers , raising critical questions only days before the judges confirmation vote was set to take place
it prompted a nationwide uproar and led to a hearing before the senate judiciary committee in which ford recounted details from a night in the 1980s when she said the incident occurred
in his own impassioned speech , kavanaugh denied the claims
but in the days since ford stepped into the public eye , berkowitz , with rainn , said a record number of sexual assault survivors have called the national sexual assault hotline
