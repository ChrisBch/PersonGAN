like other families , bryant goldbach posted a photo on social media showing him and his young son dressed in their halloween costumes
but unlike others , the kentucky father was pictured donning a nazi soldier costume thursday night at the trail of treats halloween festival in owensboro , ky. , about 115 miles southwest of louisville
he dressed his 5-year-old son as adolf hitler
goldbach said the costumes elicited almost immediate jeers at the event
it also prompted questions about goldbachs intentions as his social media history revealed memes he had posted , including some stating white pride doesnt mean hate and being liberal means being a hypocrite , according to the courier & press
goldbach could not immediately be reached for comment , and the posts have since been removed or set to private
herring said halloween costumes are a reminder that , for some , anti-semitism is a way in which they see the world.

goldbach claimed that we love history , and often dress the part of historical figures.
he told the owensboro times that he has previously gone as a confederate soldier and a catholic priest
goldbach said on facebook that adults , screaming obscenities , threatened to rip off his sons costume at the festival
first off , its none of your business
second , how dare you
he wrote , according to the courier & press.
i mean how dare you threaten a child
me , its one thing , but my child
you are messing with fire
but when the photo of the costumes was posted online , goldbach attacked liberals for what he said was intolerance
or by people who have a racist agenda.
herring said that what makes the kentucky incident so troubling is that goldbach dressed his son as someone who was responsible for casting the world into war.
most of us who have children were sickened by that , he said
