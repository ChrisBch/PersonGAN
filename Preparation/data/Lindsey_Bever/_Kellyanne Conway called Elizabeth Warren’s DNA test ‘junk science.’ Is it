after news that sen. elizabeth warren ( d-mass )
released dna results showing that she had a distant native american ancestor something president trump had dared her to do white house counselor kellyanne conway dismissed the dna test , calling it junk science.
but is it junk science
jennifer raff , an assistant professor in the anthropology department at the university of kansas , said the geneticist who analyzed warrens dna is a prominent scholar in the field , and the method he used and the way he used it was appropriate
raff , who has read the report , said the geneticist looked at warrens chromosomes and was able to trace segments of them back to a native american ancestor about six to 10 generations ago
warren releases dna test suggesting distant native american ancestor
experts said the geneticist , carlos d. bustamante , analyzed warrens genome , looking at genetic markers inherited from her ancestors , and was able to determine which groups her dna came from
the process , known as chromosome mapping , is the same one used in commercial dna tests , but raff , with the university of kansas , said bustamantes approach scrutinized the information more closely
warren released her dna test results to the boston globe , which reported that the test shows strong evidence that she had a native american ancestor
bustamante calculated that warrens pure native american ancestor appears in her family tree in the range of 6-10 generations ago.
that timing fits warrens family lore , passed down during her oklahoma upbringing , that her great-great-great-grandmother , o.c
sarah smith , was at least partially native american
there were five parts of warrens dna that signaled she had a native american ancestor , according to the report
the largest piece of native american dna was found on her 10th chromosome , according to the report
each human has 23 pairs of chromosomes
he added we are confident it is not an error.
how to interpret the results , experts said , is a separate matter
raff , with the university of kansas , said about warrens dna test results
native american identity is based not on genetics but on culture and history
kim tallbear , canada research chair in indigenous peoples , technoscience and environment at the university of alberta , called warrens claims yet another strike against tribal sovereignty.
tallbear said about the senator in a statement
trump said he would give warren , who is rumored to be a 2020 democratic presidential candidate , a test kit during the debate
trump told the crowd in montana.
and well see what she does
i have a feeling she will say no , but we will hold it for the debates.
trump promised $ 1 million to charity if warren proved her native american dna
now he denies it
warren wrote monday morning on social media that she had not forgotten trumps promise
by the way , realdonaldtrump remember saying on 7/5 that youd give $ 1m to a charity of my choice if my dna showed native american ancestry
i remember and here 's the verdict
please send the check to the national indigenous womens resource center
trump , however , denied that he ever said it
when asked monday whether he had heard that warren released her dna test results , trump said , who cares
i didnt say that , the president said when asked about his million-dollar promise.
youd better read it again.
