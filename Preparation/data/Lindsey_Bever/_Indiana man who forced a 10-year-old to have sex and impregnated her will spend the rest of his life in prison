nicholas deon thrash , 35 , was sentenced thursday to 160 years in prison after he was convicted last month on 10 counts of child molestation

after she turned 11 last year , she gave birth , according to news reports
an attorney for thrash could not be reached for comment
an alleged case of incest led to 4 senseless deaths in 3 states
one was a baby
according to an oral probable cause determination , thrash started forcing the young girl to have sex when she was 8
at the time , thrash lived with the child and her mother , who was thrashs girlfriend , in georgia , police said
the girl told investigators that since the three had moved to indiana in 2016 , thrash had forced her to have sex with him an estimated 15 more times
officers with the marion police department in indiana told the court during a probable cause hearing last year that they had learned that child welfare workers in georgia had first become aware of the allegations and that police there had opened an investigation
during that investigation , male dna was discovered on the girls underwear and authorities began searching for thrash , according to court records
court records state that around that time , thrash and the girls mother took the girl and moved to indiana
the girl told investigators that , at some point , her mother had given her a pregnancy test and determined that she was pregnant
dna testing later revealed that thrash was the babys father , according to chronicle tribune
once in indiana , the girl told investigators , her mother took her a clinic in indianapolis to see about getting an abortion , but she was denied services , according to the court documents
the girl told investigators that a group she described as protesters outside the clinic performed an ultrasound
that group then reported it to the authorities , according to the court documents
during his trial , thrash denied that he had ever forced the child to have sex with him , telling jurors that instead , the childs mother had taken his sperm and inseminated the child , according to chronicle tribune
after sentencing , prosecutors said that thrash would not be eligible for parole until serving at least 85 percent of his 160-year sentence , which means that he wont be up for parole for 136 years
the girls mother has been charged with aiding child molesting , neglect and assisting a criminal , according to prosecutors
online court records show that her trial is scheduled for oct. 9
glancy , the chief deputy prosecutor in grant county , said the girl , who is now 12 , is in a residential facility getting intense treatment.
the prosecutor said the baby was put up for adoption
