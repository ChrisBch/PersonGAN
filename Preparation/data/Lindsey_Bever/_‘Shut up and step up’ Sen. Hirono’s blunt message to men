many democrats in congress have said that they support christine blasey ford , the professor who this week publicly accused supreme court nominee brett m. kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her decades ago when the two were teenagers
but few have made as big a splash as sen. mazie hirono ( d-hawaii ) , whose statements at a news conference tuesday drew national headlines
speaking alongside democratic colleagues richard blumenthal ( conn. ) , kirsten gillibrand ( n.y. ) , and patty murray ( wash. ) , hirono criticized the way republicans are dealing with fords accusation
but it was what hirono said in response to a reporters question that turned the most heads
the reporter , who was not identified in video footage of the news conference , asked whether the four women on the senate judiciary committee all democrats could affect its deliberations over kavanaugh
hirono said it shouldnt just come down to the women
the worst is yet to come for kavanaughs accuser

hirono also reportedly told senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on tuesday to do the right thing after he passed her outside the senate chamber
