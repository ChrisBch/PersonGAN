a day after baldwin portrayed trump in a saturday night live skit about the presidents recent meeting with rapper kanye west , he addressed voters at a political fundraiser for the new hampshire democratic party , according to the associated press
baldwin went on to say that some of the republicans in power are setting up the country for failure
baldwin then said that supreme court justice brett m. kavanaugh showed how republicans see women
the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the washington post
baldwins comments were met with harsh criticism from a commentator on the other side of the aisle
nratv contributor dan bongino said monday on fox & friends that he was embarrassed for baldwin
how is there a lawful way to overthrow the government
baldwin is a deranged lunatic , and hes not even that bright
thankfully , there isnt a lawful way to overthrow the government theres an impeachment process
snl has skewered every president since ford
all of them reacted the same way until now
bongino referenced a speech that former democratic vice presidential candidate john edwards gave in 2004 in which he said he had seen up close what having two americas can do to our country.
bongino said , saying that theres academia , the media and the swamp rats and then theres the rest of us.
after speaking sunday night , baldwin told reporters that he still struggles to wrap his mind around the fact that trump is president , according to the new hampshire union leader
