other pictures show her posing behind a ram and a wild goat

she wrote online , adding eatwhatyoukill
switlyk , who hosts a hunting and fishing show for wild tv , recently posted numerous photos on facebook , instagram and twitter , showing her traveling and hunting on the island of islay in scotland
these images , of a hunter and her prey , have ignited an uproar in scotland and on social media , where switlyk has been called a coward and a disgrace and worse
you are not welcome in scotland , one person wrote
hunting is legal in the united kingdom
still , amid a mounting backlash over switlyks photos , scottish lawmakers said they may reconsider the countrys hunting laws
scottish first minister nicola sturgeon said wednesday that the government will review the current situation and consider whether changes to the law are required
switlyk could not be reached for comment
but as the backlash continued , she posted yet another photo late wednesday , showing her with a bush plane in the background
she said she was embarking on her next hunting adventure and would be without internet and cellphone service
nothing better than disconnecting from this social media driven world and connecting back with nature , she wrote
hopefully that will give enough time for all the ignorant people out there sending me death threats to get educated on hunting and conservation
a mother bear and two shrieking newborn cubs were killed in their den by hunters , troopers say
switlyk said earlier on instagram that she was in scotland more than a month ago
it wasnt until a couple of weeks after the trip , when she started posting the photos , that the backlash began
the first photo was posted oct. 10 , showing her outside mingary castle in kilchoan
feeling like royalty staying in the mingary castle and glassing for red stags with my nightforce_optics spotting scope , she wrote

the comments began to trickle in honey your def not royalty , and go back to america , and more
youre a weird person , somebody wrote
wheres the challenge in shooting defenceless goats and then posing for pictures with them as if you are cool
it honestly looks like a rubbish life
beautiful wild goat here on the island of islay in scotland
such a fun hunt
they live on the edge of the cliffs of the island and know how to hide well
we hunted hard for a big one for 2 days and finally got on this group
made a perfect 200 yard shot and dropped him with the gunwerks and nightforce_optics
( good thing too because he could have ran off the cliff into the water )

critics argued that it was disgraceful to present dead animals as trophies , and several people called switlyk a coward for killing the animals with a rifle
its one thing to actually hunt an animal with bow and arrow ( and im not talking compound bows ) because that takes actual skill , one person wrote on her instagram
using a gun is a cowardly , unskilled way to take down an unsuspecting creature
to parade its corpse around is beyond sickening
think about your actions
clearly you have no respect for life
scottish tennis coach judy murray whose adult sons , andy and jamie murray , are british tennis stars called on the government to put an end to such incidents
a unique hunt
its a goat
and its in scotland
on a beautiful island
stop this pls scotgov
sarah moyes , with the scottish animal welfare organization onekind , told itv news that the images were utterly shocking
yet again , instead of celebrating scotlands magnificent wildlife , we are seeing these beautiful animals exploited in the name of sport , she said
this is not the kind of tourism we should be encouraging in scotland , let alone allowing to happen in the 21st century
in the united kingdom , hunting and killing wild animals is legal
the law stipulates that it is illegal to hunt certain animals in certain situations , such as using a pack of dogs , or to cause unnecessary suffering to an animal , according to the governments website
roseanna cunningham , cabinet secretary for environment , climate change and land reform in scotland , said the government will look into it
we fully understand why so many people find these images of hunted animals being held up as trophies so upsetting , she said in a statement on twitter
responsible and appropriate culling of animals is a necessary part of sustainable land management and the culling of some wild animals , including deer and goats , is not illegal
however , we understand the concerns raised by these images and , in light of them , the environment secretary will review the situation and consider whether any clarification of or changes to the law might be required
big-game trophy hunting and , of course , illegal hunting have caused controversy in other countries as well
perhaps the most notable incident came in 2015 , when american dentist walter palmer hunted and killed africas beloved cecil the lion
more recently , in august , a man and his teenage son were charged with illegal hunting after killing a black bear in her den in alaska , then shooting her newborn cubs
