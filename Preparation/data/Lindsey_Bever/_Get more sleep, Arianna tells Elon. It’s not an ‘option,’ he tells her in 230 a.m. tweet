an apparently overworked , under-rested elon musk rejected arianna huffingtons recent suggestion that he get more sleep and he did so in a tweet in the middle of the night
it prompted huffington , a longtime sleep advocate who co-founded the huffpost , to reach out and offer her fellow entrepreneur some tips
huffington tweeted out the letter friday , urging the tesla executive to change his ways
if trump is as healthy as his doctor says , hes beating long odds
in her open letter to musk , huffington , who wrote a 2016 book titled the sleep revolution , cited research suggesting that sleep deprivation can lead to cognitive impairment
according to the mayo clinic , adults need seven to nine hours each night
dear elon , please change the way you work to be more in line with the science around how humans are most effective you need it , tesla needs it and the world needs it
huffington said that she wrote to musk in an open letter because the issue does not pertain to only him
huffington said in a statement monday to the washington post
musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the open letter
earlier this month , musk apologized for calling an analysts questions boneheaded and boring blaming his behavior partly on his lack of sleep
other successful business executives have said that they , too , have worked long hours
as the atlantic reported this month , pepsico chief executive indra nooyi is known for her 20-hour days
former yahoo president and chief executive marissa mayer has said when she was starting out at google , she sometimes worked 130 hours and pulled at least one all-nighter per week
mayer told bloomberg news in 2016
even president trump has said that he sleeps only about four to five hours per night
virgin group founder richard branson said he works hard , as well but he does rest
as the washington posts lenny bernstein and lena h. sun reported earlier this year , though research has shown some people can get by on a small amount of sleep , many can not
the washington post reported
but for the vast majority of others , long-term sleep deprivation is a serious threat to well-being
it weakens the immune system and is associated with higher levels of metabolic problems , including diabetes , she said
cognitive function and energy-level decline and the risk of depression and dementia increase , fu said , because the brain and body arent given enough time to flush waste products and replenish resources
medical experts agree that sleep deprivation may be associated mental and physical health issues
according to the division of sleep medicine at harvard medical school , studies have shown that inadequate sleep can lead to weight gain and obesity , diabetes , high blood pressure and heart disease , as well as depression , anxiety and other mental issues
in her statement to the post , huffington said that musks reply that slowing down isnt an option presents a false choice.
building a leadership team and effectively delegating ( the way elon has done at spacex ) , can not be done while youre running on empty
and this is true for all us.
