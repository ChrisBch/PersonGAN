ford recently spoke out against kavanaugh , whom she alleges sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers , raising critical questions only days before his confirmation vote was set to take place
some lawmakers are now calling for the vote to be delayed
trump jr. posted what appeared to be a meme over the weekend , showing a picture of an apparent schoolboy love note with the caption judge kavanaughs sexual assault letter found by dems
the satirical note shared by trump jr. was written in crayon , reading hi cindy will you be my girlfreind
it included two boxes , one for yes and one for no , and it was signed , love bret
it appeared to be mocking a confidential letter that ford sent over the summer to sen. dianne feinstein ( d-calif. ) , the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary committee , detailing her allegations against kavanaugh
oh boy ... the dems and their usual nonsense games really have him on the ropes now , trump jr. wrote , claiming that feinstein had saved the letter and released it in time for the vote
honorable as always , trump jr. added
oh boy ... the dems and their usual nonsense games really have him on the ropes now
finestein had the letter in july and saved it for the eve of his vote ... honorable as always
i believe this is a copy for full transparency
a post shared by donald trump jr. ( donaldjtrumpjr ) on sep 15 , 2018 at 12:30pm pdt
a representative for trump jr. could not immediately be reached for comment by the washington post
california professor , writer of confidential brett kavanaugh letter , speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault
conway did not directly address the meme trump jr. tweeted
conway also showed support for kavanaugh , who has denied the allegations , saying that he is a man of character and integrity who has been vetted by the fbi and lauded by women who have known him throughout his life
president trump has also defended kavanaugh , telling reporters , we want to go through a full process
and hear everybody out
according to the posts emma brown , who wrote about ford and her accusations against the supreme court nominee
speaking publicly for the first time , ford said that one summer in the early 1980s , kavanaugh and a friend both stumbling drunk , ford alleges corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in montgomery county
when she tried to scream , she said , he put his hand over her mouth
i thought he might inadvertently kill me , said ford , now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern california
he was trying to attack me and remove my clothing
ford said she was able to escape when kavanaughs friend and classmate at georgetown preparatory school , mark judge , jumped on top of them , sending all three tumbling
she said she ran from the room , briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house
ford did not wait until the eve of the vote to come forward with her allegations
after trump jr. posted the meme on instagram , lynne patton , a top official with the department of housing and urban development , commented on it , using emoji showing a laughing smiley face and raised hands , according to mediaite
she later released a statement saying that she was not trivializing sexual assault
to the contrary , she tweeted , my post was in response to the hypocrisy highlighted by donaldjtrumpjr inasmuch that senfeinstein concealed ms. fords letter for 2 mos , releasing it only when the timing best suited her own
not everyone approved
republican former congressman joe walsh criticized the presidents son , calling him an uncaring , narrow-minded idiot
no matter your take on the accusations against brett kavanaugh , i think we all can agree that donaldjtrumpjr is an uncaring , narrow-minded
walsh also called out democrats for waiting until the last moment to drop this dirt
so dems waited until the very last minute to drop this dirt , and now they want to wait again to hear from her you do n't think they 're trying to drag this thing out do you
