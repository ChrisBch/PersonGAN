the 4-year-old boy fancied himself a real-life superhero , wearing a blue t-shirt with photographs of his 4-month-old twin brothers , who were born with a rare immunodeficiency disease
hey , michael , his mother , robin pownall , called out as she filmed her young son early one thursday morning in march , running ahead of her through childrens hospital of philadelphia ( chop )
yeaaaah
he responded , hanging back to let her catch up
you ready to go
his mother asked
yay
he said , pumping his fists and jumping up and down
where you going
she asked him
to save my baby brothers , he said
to save your baby brothers
youre the best.
the preschooler knew what was about to happen , his mother said a long needle would be pushed into the bone near his hip to extract the marrow , then the cells would be transplanted into his brothers
he did it anyway
and later in the day , when his brothers received the stem-cell infusion , michael was there to watch , jumping and shouting , thats my bone marrow
thats my bone marrow
his mother said
nearly two months after the procedure , the twins were discharged last week from the hospital
their mother posted a video on facebook , showing michael wearing a superhero t-shirt , smiling and standing between his little brothers
i saved you guys , the preschooler said.
its time to go home.
this 3-year-old has a sparkle in her heart the worlds smallest mechanical heart valve
santino and giovanni were born in october with chronic granulomatous disease ( cgd ) , an immune disease in which the immune system does not work properly , meaning even a common cold could become life-threatening , their mother told the washington post
she and her fiance , michael demasi , were already familiar with the condition
their oldest son , dominick , 9 , was also born with gcd and they knew it was a possibility that their other children would be born with the disease
following his diagnosis only weeks after his birth , dominick was put on a transplant list and received stem cells from the umbilical cord of a donor
he is now considered cured , his mother said
when the twins turned out to have cgd , michael , who was not born with the condition , was tested and found to be a match
his parents talked to their doctors about the risks , such as pain and soreness and complications from anesthesia , then they sat down with michael and tried to explain
michael knew that his little brothers were sick and he knew that they needed bone marrow
he also knew that he had been tested to determine whether he was a match , his mother said
when his parents told him he was , he exclaimed , im the match
im the match
his parents asked him whether he wanted to go through with the donation
pownall said her son asked whether his bone marrow would allow his little brothers to come home
she said yes
he said okay
pownall said her son told her he wanted to help save my baby brothers.
but pownall said the decision was not simple she and her fiance grappled with the option , wondering whether michael understood what was being asked of him and whether it was right to ask him at all
she added that doctors at the hospital sat down with michael and made sure he understood and that he was okay with it
he said that before such procedures are performed , he hopes to see an ethics committee review the circumstances to ensure there are no risks for the donor that the parents may not be considering
but in general , im inclined to allow it to happen , he said , assuming that those involved understand and accept the risks
its unclear whether chop had an ethics committee review michaels case
a hospital spokeswoman said she could not comment on michaels case , and when asked whether chop requires an ethics committee to weigh in on situations involving child donors , she said that she could not confirm that either
on march 8 , michael marched down to the hospitals patient check-in area
his mother had told him that he was going to be a real-life superhero , and the small boy who loves captain america as well as spider-man , batman and superman seemed excited to join their ranks
the nurse told him that she was going to give him some giggle juice and he would go to sleep , his mother recalled
hes so small , she added.
you dont want your babies to be in pain.
michael woke up with small welts on his back , but insisted he was not in pain , his mother said
pownall posted a video after his procedure , showing michael with blue popsicle juice all over his face.
ive got a blue tongue , he said , sticking it out for the camera.
because my popsicle was blue.
hours later , the 4-year-old was jumping up and down , watching his bone marrow go to work
the childrens aunt wrote on a gofundme page that michael and his brothers were doing well
she posted an update last week , saying the transplants were successful and the twins were home
pownall said that now the twins , who are nearly 7 months old , show no signs of chronic granulomatous disease , though their doctors are monitoring them closely
michael , for his part , told the post in a brief , distracted conversation that he felt good about helping his brothers
