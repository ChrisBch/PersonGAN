during the 2004 republican national convention , arnold schwarzenegger stood at a lectern at madison square garden in new york , speaking about what it means to him to be a republican
he went on
now , theres another way you can tell youre a republican , he said
you have faith in free enterprise , faith in the resourcefulness of the american people and faith in the u.s. economy
and to those critics who are so pessimistic about our economy , i say dont be economic girly men.
it wasnt the first time that schwarzenegger used the term girly men to refer to political opponents , but now , more than a decade later , he says he regrets it
he said in an interview published wednesday in mens health magazine
opinion i knew gov
mr. trump , youre no gov
the phrase girly men had been previously used by the actor-turned-politician and also appeared in a saturday night live skit in which comedians dana carvey and kevin nealon played schwarzenegger-like bodybuilders named hans and franz
in fact , before schwarzenegger said it at the 2004 republican national convention , he used it at a political rally
in the summer of 2004 , schwarzenegger called democrats girly men and urged voters to terminate them on election day prompting outrage from his opponents , the los angeles times reported at the time
then-california state senate president pro tem john burton told the times
in his recent interview with mens health magazine , schwarzenegger suggested his language had been counterproductive
when you can reach out across the aisle and work together , you can get much more accomplished , rather than girly men
or its my way or the highway , he said
