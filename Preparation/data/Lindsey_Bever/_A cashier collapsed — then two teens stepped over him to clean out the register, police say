a convenience store clerk in washington state stumbled into a tower of water bottles and collapsed from an apparent heart attack
instead of calling 911 , two teenage boys stepped over his body to steal merchandise and money then left him to die , police said
surveillance video released by the police shows the teenagers repeatedly jumping over the counter to steal from the cash register while kelada was apparently unconscious on the ground
according to a gofundme page set up for kelada , he is in the hospital on artificial life support
it 's heartbreaking , angela sharapova , the store manager , told the washington post on wednesday morning in a phone interview.
i could n't believe my eyes
it blows my mind
it 's totally unbelievable , totally unacceptable
it 's inhuman
i ca n't even tell you how i feel about it
authorities said earlier this week that they have identified the teenagers , who are 13 and 17 , as well as an adult who had accompanied them in the store
police added wednesday that investigators have spoken with the man but that he does not seem to be associated with the teenagers
a police spokesman said that they are still searching for the boys and that once they are found , they could face charges including theft , burglary and possibly failing to render assistance to someone in need
my dad taught us some moves girls used kicks and coffee to escape a kidnapper , police say
authorities said in a statement that after the man and two teenagers entered the shell station early saturday evening , one of the teens took a pepperoni stick and started to eat it , then took another one and gave it to the other teen
when the man went to pay for his item , the cashier attempted to charge him for the pepperoni sticks as well , police said
in the surveillance video , it appeared as though there was a dispute
the cashier appeared to confront them , and at some point , one of the teens handed the cashier $ 1 , police said
the video then showed the cashier walk around the counter to talk to them and that 's when he collapsed , police said
one of the teens quickly took back the $ 1 , hopped over the counter to steal some items and then exit the store , police said
the video showed the teens return at least twice in the moments after the incident for more merchandise and for the cash
sharapova , the manager , said the teenagers appeared to be stealing packs of cigarettes and a total of $ 178 in cash
not something that 's worth somebody 's life , she told the post
several minutes later , another customer entered the store , saw the cashier and called 911 , the authorities said
the man , who was not identified , told the station
the gofundme for kelada stated that he has three young children and that wednesday was his birthday
today is zarif 's birthday , and he is spending it in critical care , it said.
he is not able to breathe on his own yet
however , he has opened his eyes a few times and even moved his foot
the doctors say this is a good sign
please continue to keep zarif and his family in your prayers and hearts
