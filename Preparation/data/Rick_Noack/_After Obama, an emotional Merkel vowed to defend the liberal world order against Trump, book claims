it appeared to be pure coincidence that less than two weeks later , merkel also announced that she would run for a fourth term , after thinking about it for an eternity.
in his book , rhodes goes on to describe an emotional last goodbye between merkel and obama as president , writing that she had a single tear in her eye.
shes all alone , rhodes quoted obama as noting at the time
the excerpt does not indicate when the conversation took place , but rhodes is probably referring to obamas visit to berlin in mid-november , days after trumps victory
as obama left the world stage , merkel was almost immediately branded the new leader of the free world a title that she later acknowledged left her uncomfortable
one of merkels most distinctive character traits has long been caution
the chancellor was widely applauded for her remarks at the time , but critics say merkel has not done enough since then to follow up on her words
few germans believe their country should assume a more influential role in world affairs anyway , and 52 percent said in a recent survey by the krber foundation that more restraint was beneficial
that is one reason the german military remains so chronically underfunded that it is virtually not deployable for collective defense , according to an independent commissioner
even if merkel decided to ignore that sentiment , she would have few options to directly confront trump
as trump withdrew from the paris climate accord , the iran nuclear deal and free-trade commitments , top german officials either said there was nothing they could do about it or that they were seeking to de-escalate tensions
so far , german efforts to uphold the international liberal order have focused on strengthening european institutions and trying to soothe some of the tensions that have arisen over trumps policies regarding iran , israel and china
whereas previous u.s. provocations mostly drew a verbal backlash from europe , the e.u
said thursday that it also would impose duties on some u.s. products with the backing of merkel and other european leaders
one of merkels other confrontational moves has been the construction of north stream 2 , a pipeline that would connect central europe with russian gas supplies
critics , including the u.s. government , say the pipeline would make germany too dependent on russia
the german government has vehemently denied this
and yet , defending russian-european projects against u.s. criticism probably was not what anyone had in mind when talking about the defense of the liberal international order
