berlin to be granted asylum as an lgbt refugee in austria , there are a number of criteria an applicant should apparently meet if they want their application to succeed
their walk and clothes should look homosexual
their gestures and behavior should also convey their sexual orientation
oh , and dont get into a fight with anyone , because gays arent really aggressive
gays also have lots of friends though , so beware if youre more of the introverted type
what sounds like a list of cliches from a different era appears to have been the basis for at least one rejected asylum application of an 18-year-old afghan refugee in vienna , the capital of austria
when he first entered the country , the teenager failed to disclose his homosexuality , later saying that he was intimidated by his translator
officials were not convinced
said marty huber , a human rights activist with the queer base nongovernmental organization that has represented the teenager
wrote the official who rejected the teenagers asylum claim
the official asked
said ministry spokesman christoph plzl
the 18-year-old has appealed against the decision and remains in austria
the post could not independently verify the asylum seekers complaints , but critics of austrias right-wing government said that the stereotypes authorities relied on to reject his application reflected a worrisome but common pattern
while other cases have raised less public attention , stereotypes are frequently used to justify asylum rejections , said huber , whose organization has provided support to about 400 lgbt asylum seekers in austria
last year , 31-year-old center-right party leader sebastian kurz won the austrian elections and subsequently formed a coalition with the countrys controversial far-right and anti-immigrant party
kurz and his coalition partners have pursued some of western europes toughest immigration laws , and critics argue that their rhetoric has emboldened right-wing extremists and xenophobes
the countrys tougher immigration laws have also clashed with a recent ruling by the european court of justice that outlawed personality tests as evidence in asylum applications by lgbt refugees
despite the clear ruling by europes highest court , many european nations including austria continue to justify rejected applications with arguments that come close to or are equivalent to personality tests , rights groups say
in the case of 28-year-old iranian navid jafartash , the threshold for taking that risk was low
jafartash was 100 percent sure that his application would be accepted when he appeared for an interview at austrias asylum authority , he said thursday
after all , the iranian had an austrian boyfriend , a number of gay austrian friends and had even appeared on the countrys main evening news cast to discuss homosexuality an interview for which he could have faced the death penalty in iran
his meeting at the asylum authority appeared to go well , jafartash recalled
the official asked only three questions , including one about the origins of the rainbow flag
the official wrote
the official went on
jafartash was stunned by the rejection letter.
i was so sad , he said
the 28-year-old eventually appealed the decision , and the rejection was later overturned by a higher court
jafartash and austrian human rights organizations believe that the high initial rejection rates among lgbt refugees are part of a deliberate pattern in austria
said plzl , who indicated that the country was open to teaming up with the u.n
refugee agency to offer more extensive training to its officials
