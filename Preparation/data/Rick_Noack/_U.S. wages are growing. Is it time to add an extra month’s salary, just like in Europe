berlin just days ahead of tuesdays midterm elections , the u.s. labor department released new wage growth figures last week showing the strongest annual year-on-year rise since 2009
private workers now make $ 27.30 per hour on average
the trump administration has celebrated those figures as a watershed moment for the u.s. economy , which produced job gains in recent years but little improvement in wages
but the united states isnt the only country where workers are better off
in europe , wages have been on the rise , too
measuring the extent to which wages have improved here since the financial crisis is a bit trickier , however
one reason for that is europes 13th salary phenomenon
while most americans receive 12 months of salary each year , many europeans receive 13
similar arrangements are in place in latin america and parts of asia
with u.s. unemployment dropping and wages on the rise , a 13th salary in the united states might not appear as far-fetched anymore as it did in prior years
but would it make sense
originally conceived as a way to get people to spend more money on gifts ahead of christmas , the practice now widely varies across europe
in germany , nine out of 10 employees benefit from a 13th salary each year under terms that are usually agreed between unions and employers , according to new figures released monday
while contractors benefit least , employees in the gas or pharmaceutical industries often receive additional bonuses that are higher than their pay in a normal month
some countries , including austria , have lower tax rates for 13th salary payments than for normal salaries
elsewhere , there are deadlines for employers to transfer a specified rate or even rules for a 14th salary
but the vast majority of european countries have provided employers with a lot of leeway to determine how much and to whom they pay additional money , making total income less transparent
the practice might appear strange to most americans , but some european employees have also long been unaware that they would be entitled to extra money
last year , the government of cyprus launched a campaign to inform employees of their right to demand a 13th salary
noncompliance is a punishable offense in cyprus , with a maximum fine of $ 17,000 or six months in prison
while the idea of adding a 13th or 14th months salary payment might sound intriguing to many american employees , some critics insist that the united states is better off without it
the extra payments are usually not included in average salary figures , and they can unpredictably vary from year to year , even if wages themselves may stall or grow more rapidly
given its strong association with christmas celebrations , the practice has also become politicized in some countries such as austria , where far-right groups suggested in 2016 that muslims should be excluded
more recently , far-right groups also circulated unsubstantiated rumors that refugees were paid almost $ 1,000 each ahead of christmas celebrations adding a political spin to what was long a popular measure to boost wages and domestic spending
