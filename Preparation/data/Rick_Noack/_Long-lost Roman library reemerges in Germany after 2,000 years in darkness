when the romans expanded across europe 2,000 years ago , they made inroads into almost every corner of the continent , fighting as far away as scotland and sending its coins to what today is estonia
but germany posed a particular challenge
in the year 9 of our modern calendar system , the romans suffered an embarrassing defeat in the battle of the teutoburg forest near the modern day city of hanover
they never recovered from it and were permanently pushed back to the western side of the rhine river , which separates germany from south to north , 50 miles from teutoburg
centuries later , marauders from germany finally brought an end to the western half of the roman empire
yet the roman were quite active on the western side of the rhine and left behind a vast number of architectural masterpieces
archaeologists still keep discovering remnants of that part of german history
and one of the most astonishing buildings from that era the countrys oldest-known public library is only now being uncovered
built about 150 years after the battle of the teutoburg forest , its walls recently reemerged after centuries of darkness during the construction of a new community center next to the city of colognes famous cathedral
at first , when the walls were discovered last year , researchers assumed they had come across a community hall dating to the roman era
but this summer , a more extensive analysis found the building was most likely used to store up to 20,000 scrolls of parchment
( the estimate would put the cologne library in the same category as the vast library of celsus , which was built in turkey at about the same time )
the room that researchers believe was used as a library was 65 feet long and 30 feet wide , with a 30-foot-high ceiling , according to estimates
but what really captured the researchers attention were the roughly 30-inch-deep wall recesses , which bore striking similarities with the setup of other rooms that were used as libraries during the roman era
so far , roman libraries have mostly been found in egypt or italy
the cologne find may be the first such discovery in the roman empires northwestern regions , which at its peak spanned france , britain and western germany
across the empire , roman emperors left their footprint by introducing currencies , occupying territories and constructing buildings that reflected a culture that prospered for centuries though it was built on the exploitation and oppression of other peoples
while the walls discovered in central cologne may once have accommodated a library , the use of the word public still remains controversial
in the 1st century a.d. about 50 to 100 years before the cologne building was constructed roman emperor augustus began to embrace state libraries
originally a greek concept , the romans soon started building similarly impressive collections across their territory
the roman empires official libraries also appear to have been used for censorship of literature , according to dix
the community centers parking lot that was supposed to be constructed on top of it will now host two fewer parking spaces than planned
instead , a glass window on the ground will allow visitors to get a glimpse of an era long predating europes current borders
