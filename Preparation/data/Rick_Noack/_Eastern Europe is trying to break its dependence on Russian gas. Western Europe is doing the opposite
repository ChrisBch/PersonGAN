paldiski , estonia for most of the 20th century , the baltic nations were dominated by the soviet union , its behemoth neighbor to the east
today , almost three decades after gaining independence from moscow , the physical remnants of that rule are still scattered across the region
the same applies to their economies
until recently , estonia , finland , latvia and lithuania relied 100 percent on russian gas for their energy needs
now the baltic and nordic states are trying to break free of their dependence on russian gas imports
finland and estonia are building the balticconnector , a major new pipeline between the two countries that could bring natural gas from the united states and other nations to finland
it will be the first pipeline into finland that does not originate in russia
said emmet tuohy , a senior research fellow at the estonian school of diplomacy
at the same time , much of the rest of europe is preparing to tie its energy future even closer to moscow
russia is building its own pipeline , called nord stream 2 , that could double the amount of natural gas it exports to germany
that pipeline has become a flash point of european energy politics , pitting countries that need reliable supplies of russian gas against others that see those supplies as another way for moscow to meddle in europes affairs
for the european union , natural gas is critical it currently generates more than one-fourth of the e.u
's electricity needs , which are only growing
a third of the e.u
's gas currently comes from russia , and moscow is hoping to boost its market share further
to ensure it does , gazprom is building two new pipelines into europe
one of them , called turkish stream , will serve southern european markets via turkey and greece
but the far more controversial project is nord stream 2 , which ends in northern germany and is slated to supply major western european nations , among others
western european countries hope more gas trade with russia will reduce tensions and give them common economic interests with moscow
but nord stream 2s critics fear the project will only make europe even more dependent on russia and vulnerable to its political whims
at one point , the white house even seriously considered levying sanctions to halt the project
and warning it would give russia leverage to intervene in european politics.
many of those countries still remember the dispute between ukraine and russia that began in march 2005
at the time , moscow accused kiev of diverting gas meant for e.u
nations and redirecting it to its own storage sites , thus avoiding paying for its own energy consumption
the dispute escalated in 2009 , when russia stopped piping gas through ukraine to force kiev to stop its alleged practices , which hit the nations that depend largely or completely on russian gas hardest
russia and germany concluded new pipelines were needed to avoid the fraught route through ukraine
things became even more complicated in june 2014 , following a pro-european revolt in ukraine that triggered russias annexation of crimea
as russian-backed rebels fought ukrainian soldiers , moscow turned up the pressure by cutting off ukraines gas supplies
european pressure on russia eventually ended the blockade , but ukraine and other eastern european countries fear their western european partners will be less inclined to help them once they receive gas through the new pipelines
it would increase russias leverage all of the sudden they would have another route and option to stranglehold ukraine and to demand better transit conditions , said nolan theisen , head of the globsec policy institutes energy program
in germany itself , nord stream 2 has faced mounting resistance in reaction to russian military operations in georgia , ukraine and syria
said andreas heinrich , an eastern europe researcher at the university of bremen
indeed , western europe has few alternatives
britain , norway and the netherlands are western and northern europes biggest gas producers , primarily relying on natural gas fields in the north sea
but over the next few decades , europes own resources which accounted for more than a third of its supplies in 2016 are expected to gradually disappear
the supplies could be substituted either by russian natural gas or by liquefied natural gas ( lng ) , which is natural gas that has been cooled down so much it becomes liquid and fits into shipping tanks
new fracking and drilling technology has already made the united states the worlds biggest natural-gas producer
it is now trying to become the top lng exporter , as well , with europe being its biggest potential market
so far , 4 percent of american lng goes to europe , compared with 59 percent that is exported to asian markets
that could change when the construction of six new european lng port terminal is completed , with most of them located in former soviet union member states
that is why key german business groups believe american export interests , rather than security concerns , are behind trumps recent attacks on nord stream 2
dieter kempf , the president of germanys industrial association told the sddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview that lng would likely never constitute a real alternative to russian gas
he argued that shipping lng across the atlantic ocean is too expensive a conclusion currently shared by a number of energy experts , including theisen
shipping lng across the atlantic can take weeks and constructing the terminals where the gas would be unloaded is expensive
