in the end , the question is how the far right got here and if its here to stay
there are a number of possible explanations
many circle around 2015 , when sweden took in more refugees per capita than any other european country
others suggest economic promises motivated the majority of the far-right 's voters
but to understand how one party managed to dominate public discourse , it helps to go back 50 years and take a 15-minute metro ride from stockholms city center to the suburb of husby
half a century on , virtually all of the dozens of districts built as part of the same scheme have become areas that are shunned by white swedes
the district made global news in 2013 when it was hit by violent riots
out of husby 's more than 10,000 residents , almost 90 percent are foreigners or children of migrants
to sweden 's far right , husby and similar suburbs have become a rallying cry
throughout the most recent campaign , they portrayed them as areas where foreigners unwilling to integrate live miserable lives with high crime rates
president trump brought the debate into the international spotlight last year when he asked to look at whats happening last night in sweden , referring to a fox news report
but the truth is a lot more complex
for half a century , swedens strongly regulated housing market has pushed newly arrived migrants into neighborhoods that have become increasingly segregated
while the country regularly tops global education and well-being rankings , government after government have failed to tackle the emergence of an isolated and deprived minority
segregation has created an antagonistic mentality on both sides , with many white swedes blaming migrants for their failure to integrate and migrants feeling deliberately left behind
husby was built as part of one of europes most ambitious construction projects ever , the million program.
amid a severe housing crisis in the 1970s , the swedish government raised entirely new towns outside the bigger cities to house the working class
to create good democratic citizens.
at the time , swedish officials didnt hide their intention of separating the working class from the rest of society , and for a few decades , the monotonous apartment blocs were relatively popular
that started changing in the 1990s after hundreds of thousands of workers lost their jobs in what is sometimes described as sweden 's 2008 financial crisis.
in some districts , employment suddenly fell by 50 percent , said roger andersson , a professor in social and economic geography at uppsala university
as crime rates increased , white residents moved out of the million program districts
when the migrants began arriving , it was often the only option available to them
districts once built to separate out the working class were now separating newly arrived migrants from the rest of society
said irene molina , a researcher at uppsala university
by 2008 , official statistics showed racial segregation was widespread across the country
the stigma is not always based on facts
while some million program districts have higher rates of certain crimes , they are still far less dangerous than many u.s. cities
when 15-year-old halima and her 14-year-old classmate montadar talk about husby , they mention how it is so well connected , and they speak about the great restaurants and nearby concerts
we learn from each other here , halima said
yeah , we learn from other cultures , montadar agreed
halima said , wearing a gray headscarf and clutching her school ipad
montadars parents are from iraq
halimas parents came to sweden from eritrea
both were sitting in the entrance of husbys main public school last week , reflecting on a swedish election campaign they felt was removed from reality
the core issue , experts said , is that consecutive swedish governments have failed to tackle the million programs structural flaws that have resulted in segregation and social isolation
given that swedens housing market offers few rental options inside city centers , migrants are often stuck to moving between or within million program districts
education and employment efforts may have had some success in recent years , but the us-against-them mentality has persisted as segregation has even increased with the influx of more refugees
school principal duvnas has struggled to hire qualified teachers , despite having enough funding.
people think its wild over here , said duvnas , who hired buissereth-lindner , the american who now works at the school as a motivational coach and english teacher
said million program researcher molina
sitting in front of their school , halima and montadar had a solution at hand.
the racist mind-set could end if people came here , halima said
