romanian politics were thrown into a tailspin this week after the revelation that president trumps personal lawyer , rudolph w. giuliani , wrote a letter criticizing an anti-corruption drive that has been welcomed by the state department
giuliani , for his part , has insisted that he is a private citizen and was not speaking on behalf of the trump administration
but that is not the way the letter was received in romania , where critics of the anti-corruption drive seized on it as an endorsement from a senior official who has trumps ear
its a big deal in romania , said marius pancu , an anchor with independent tv network digi24.
so far , the ruling partys problem was that they had no foreign support for their plans
now , theyre trying to imply that with giulianis statement , the situation has changed
the romanians may have a point trump often inclines toward the last person he hears from on any given topic
just last week , he echoed a conspiracy theory about south african land reforms and directed the state department to monitor large scale killing of white farmers in the country after watching an inaccurate report on fox news
and giuliani is not the first trump adviser to profit from work for foreign interests while part of the presidents team
former national security adviser michael flynn had a contract from the turkish government to lobby for the deportation of a turkish pastor in pennsylvania
the family businesses of trumps son-in-law , jared kushner , have sought investments from china , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates
romania a member of nato and the european union is routinely ranked among the most corrupt countries in europe
the country enacted certain anti-corruption measures to meet e.u
but the ruling social democratic party has sought to weaken those measures , prompting a succession of protests over the past year , including a demonstration of more than 100,000 people just weeks ago
the party contends that the systems flaws extend into romanias anti-corruption agency itself
many of the jailed or prosecuted politicians have been social democrats
and members of the party say that anti-corruption probes are being used to intimidate or remove political opponents a view now also backed by giuliani
dragneas enthusiasm about giulianis letter might not be entirely unexpected for another reason he himself is appealing a prison sentence for abuse of office
wrote daniel brett of university college london school of slavonic and east european studies in london earlier this month
in romania , the ruling party is now framing giulianis remarks in a way that suggests the end of that unity
