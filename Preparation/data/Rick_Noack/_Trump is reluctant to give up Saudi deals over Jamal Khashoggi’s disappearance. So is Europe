berlin by the time the german coalition government was formed this spring , the country had become one of saudi arabias most outspoken critics
german foreign minister sigmar gabriel had just taken on the saudis , prompting the withdrawal of the saudi ambassador and of saudi investments in the country
the germans also agreed they wouldnt sell any more arms to riyadh
yet six months later , the saudi ambassador is back in berlin , and germany is once again pushing to sell defense equipment to the kingdom , which has come under criticism for its involvement in the devastating war in yemen
germanys top diplomat now calls the previous diplomatic spat a misunderstanding.
the silent reversal of germanys confrontational approach toward riyadh couldnt have come at a more awkward time
since the oct. 2 disappearance of saudi washington post columnist jamal khashoggi , companies and governments worldwide have come under pressure to abandon their ties to the saudi arabian leadership
saudi arabia has denied allegations that it is behind the columnists disappearance , but turkish authorities say they have audio and video recordings that prove khashoggi died inside the saudi consulate in istanbul
in the united states , president trump has found himself under growing pressure to act after a bipartisan group of senators triggered global magnitsky sanctions procedures last week
the magnitsky legislation forces trump to determine whether any country or individual responsible for the writers disappearance should be held accountable
trump himself said there would be severe punishment if an investigation found saudi arabia to be responsible
there has been far less pressure on other countries with deep saudi ties to act , however
while britain , france and germany issued a joint statement over the weekend in which they called for a credible investigation , none of the three countries have gone beyond the remarks so far voiced by the white house
if anything , theyve been even less vocal
while u.s. pressure on trump has been bipartisan , in europe , calls to punish saudi arabia have mostly come from opposition parties
britains labour party pressed the conservative government over the weekend to stop arms sales to the country until they changed their ways , said labour foreign policy expert emily thornberry
while german observers have lashed out at trump for refusing to punish the saudis , german chancellor angela merkels spokesman said the khashoggi case and german exports to riyadh were two unrelated things.
in a country thats already facing economic uncertainty over brexit , the dismantling of saudi ties could have severe repercussions
in the first six months of 2017 alone , britain sold riyadh military equipment worth about $ 1.4 billion , with thousands of british jobs dependent on the sales
saudi arabia has said it wont bend to threats and would respond with greater action to any sanctions imposed amid mounting u.s. and international pressure
the saudi response during the weekend largely matched prior reactions to bilateral disputes
when canada voiced alarm at the arrest of a saudi womens rights activist , riyadh immediately expelled the canadian ambassador in august and suspended investments and flights
the move was widely seen as an indication of the kingdoms new foreign policy assertiveness , which has consisted of aggressive policies that have triggered little outrage among its western allies
as of last year , more than a dozen other european union member states were selling military equipment to the saudis , with france being the second biggest exporter after britain , according to the stockholm international peace research institute
sweden offered a rare rebuke in 2015 when it risked a diplomatic spat by voicing concern over the arrest and trial of saudi writer raif badawi
but sweden and canada arent britain , which exports as much to saudi arabia and its allies in the gulf region as to india and china combined
still , wearing , the foreign policy researcher , believes sentiments in britain and perhaps elsewhere could be changing
some of that pressure is coming from the labour party , which pushed for arms deals with saudi arabia in the past but is now opposed
that raises the stakes for the decision trump will eventually have to make
