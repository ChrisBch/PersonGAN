berlin in the last column he wrote before he disappeared , washington post contributing columnist jamal khashoggi issued a powerful plea for freedom of expression in the middle east
radio free europe ( rfe ) was established months into the cold war between the united states and its western allies , on one side , and the soviet union and its eastern european client states
sponsored by the u.s. government , the radio station first broadcast to soviet-controlled czechoslovakia in 1951 , a decade before the berlin wall was built
at the time , the broadcaster came up with creative proposals to spread its message , including by printing leaflets that were dropped with balloons across eastern europe some of them never made it after they were targeted by soviet fighter jets
later on , rfe added stations for listeners in bulgaria , hungary , poland and other countries
throughout the cold war , the soviet union and its allies in eastern europe attempted to interrupt or permanently stop the broadcasts
but rfe was by far the key media foe of those regimes
in 1981 , a swiss terrorist targeted the broadcasters munich headquarters , causing massive damage within a radius of half a mile in the worst attack against the stations czechoslovakia service
six people were injured
despite the attacks , rfe continued to provide a platform to critics of the soviet union and other nations in the region , providing a counterbalance to government-controlled media outlets
and for doing so at a time when telling the truth was counted as a crime against the state.
to key opposition figures such as vaclav havel in czechoslovakia , rfe was one of the few tools to reach potential domestic supporters
but the broadcasters advantage at the time was that the country backing it stood for clear ideals those opposition members sought to copy and implement at home
the arab worlds media landscape with its large variety of stakeholders financed or hosted by countries with opposing goals is much more difficult to navigate
when the arab spring began in 2011 , arab media outlets with transnational ambitions soon faced a similar dilemma as rfe did decades earlier after the fall of the berlin wall and the rise of independent media across the region
yet with parts of eastern europe still ranking low on press freedom indexes , rfe still has a mission in the region but far less influence than at its peak during the cold war
the situation is very different for arab media after 2011
political science professor march lynch wrote in his 2015 essay the rise and fall of the new arab public sphere.
instead , with the rise of other slick saudi-backed media outlets and qatars own meddling in the region , al jazeera was relegated to being just another partisan player
