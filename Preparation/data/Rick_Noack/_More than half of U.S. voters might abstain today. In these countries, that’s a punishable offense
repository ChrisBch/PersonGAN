for decades , the united states has had voting turnout much lower than in most other developed nations
between 50 and 60 percent of americans tend to show up for presidential elections , and turnout often falls below 40 percent in midterm votes
the last midterms in 2014 were marked by particularly low participation , with a turnout of only 36.7 percent
there are some indications that this years turnout will be higher , probably driven up by deepened polarization that tends to mobilize voters
but it is still likely that nonvoters will once again outnumber voters
meanwhile , belgium , turkey and australia have all had turnout rates of more than 80 percent in recent years
and while turnout can also be boosted by holding elections on weekends or automatically registering eligible voters , those three nations have something else in common they have mandatory-voting laws
while mandatory-voting laws might be more symbolic in some nations , a lesson that is frequently echoed in all those countries is that higher turnouts also have a broader stimulating impact on political participation
although switzerland has no national legislation that forces citizens to vote , at least one region , or canton , requires residents to regularly head to the polls
officials there say the law has resulted in more diverse and more active political debate , too
senior regional official stefan bilger told swiss public television during elections in 2014
and thats despite the fact that the cantons procedures are relatively lax compared to those in some other countries
if you are ill or out of town , you probably wont face a fine
in australia , meanwhile , not casting your ballot and refusing to pay a fine can land you in court
in some of those nations , making voting a strictly enforced assignment rather than a right has historical origins
in belgium and australia , for example , requirements were introduced by parties weary of better-funded opponents that appeared more successful at mobilizing voters
mandatory voting was a way to limit the influence of groups that may not represent the majority but were disproportionately well-organized
similar arguments led to the introduction of mandatory-voting laws in latin america , where enforcement differs widely
some nations enforce the laws by threatening civil servants with work bans or banking customers with transaction restrictions
in other places , punishments for failing to show up to vote exist only on paper
university of georgia researcher shane p. singh wrote in a recent analysis
at least in europe , the introduction of more compulsory-voting laws would probably benefit some political parties more than others
when eth zurich researchers examined the impact of compulsory voting in federal referendums , they were correct in anticipating a massive increase in participation but with it also came more support for policies backed by left-wing candidates
the researchers concluded , based on historical data
( overall , turnout increased by 30 percent )
the exact electoral impact may vary among nations , of course , as right-wing candidates may back positions often more associated with left-wing candidates , for instance
but the swiss researchers broader finding that mandatory voting mobilizes groups of voters who would not otherwise cast their ballots can be both exciting and disconcerting , depending on whom you support
