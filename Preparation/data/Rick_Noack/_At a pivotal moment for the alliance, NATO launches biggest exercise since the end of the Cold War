warsaw one month after russia launched its biggest-ever military exercise with 300,000 soldiers , its main rival to the west returned the favor on thursday
about 50,000 troops will participate in the two-week-long trident juncture nato drill in and around norway
besides the 29 member states , troops from non-nato countries finland and sweden were also invited to join
nato counters , however , that recent aggressions have mainly originated in moscow
russia and european union member states have traded accusations over airspace violations and military buildups in eastern europe
the exercise also comes days after president trump announced that he would withdraw the united states from a landmark russian-american treaty in place since the soviet era that limits intermediate-range nuclear weapons
both the obama and the trump administrations have accused russia of violating the inf pact , despite persistent russian denials
even though u.s. allies in europe have acknowledged russian violations , they have urged the united states to stick to the agreement , once again revealing the divisions within nato that have deepened since trump became president
ahead of a major nato summit this summer , u.s. allies even feared a crackup of the alliance , after trump repeatedly voiced doubts over defending nations he considers to be in breach of their own financial commitments
despite the verbal attacks , those fears have so far not materialized
trump has even supported some nato-led efforts to strengthen the alliance
but u.s. allies in europe still worry that the president is not fully committed to the alliance , which is based on the principle of common defense in case of an outside attack on one of its members
in july , trump suggested the united states may not in all cases defend tiny nato member state montenegro , referring to the country as a broader example rather than commenting on a specific threat
many smaller countries in the baltic region right next to russia are in a similar position as montenegro and immediately voiced complaints over trumps remarks
but the united states is also by far the most powerful nato member
in 2016 , u.s. defense spending was nearly three times as much as the rest of nato
despite speculation over further u.s. troops reductions in europe , however , the united states has announced a boost in its ranks in germany , norway and other countries in recent months
up to 700 u.s. marines will be based in norway in the coming years , where they will cooperate with british troops who are also headed north
the moves come after russia similarly boosted its troop presence in the north of europe , near the arctic
norway is one of four nato countries sharing a border with russia
with tensions running high , nato officials emphasized this week that all elements of the current exercise would be at least 310 miles far away from the russian border
said norwegian lt. gen. rune jakobsen
