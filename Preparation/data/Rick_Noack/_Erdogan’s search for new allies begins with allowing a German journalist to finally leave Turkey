berlin officially , europe , the united states and turkey all consider themselves to be allies , woven together by their nato membership
but in reality , all three partners have been at odds with one another since at least last year , with turkish president recep tayyip erdogans increasingly authoritarian rule and president trumps confrontational trade policies posing the biggest challenges
u.s.-turkish tensions escalated after a deal to free american pastor andrew brunson fell apart at the end of july , provoking trumps anger and u.s. tariffs that sent the turkish currency into a downward spiral
brunson has been held by turkish officials on terrorism-related charges for two years
whereas u.s.-turkish talks over brunsons release appear to be deadlocked , an istanbul court has now lifted a travel ban on 33-year-old german journalist mesale tolu , another prisoner western countries considered to be held for political reasons
tolu had mostly worked with left-wing news outlets , and the decision to allow her to leave the country was first made public by a support group monday
the announcement came as a surprise to observers , but there were other signs that turkey may be looking for ways to repair damaged ties to europe that faltered after a 2016 coup attempt , as the united states steps up its pressure
when erdogan warned in an op-ed one week ago that turkey has alternatives to the united states , his comments were widely seen as a turn toward china , russia or qatar
but they might also have been directed at european leaders
there are reasons to remain skeptical about whether european hopes of a thaw in european-turkish ties are justified
besides tolu , turkey still holds seven more german citizens who are considered to be political prisoners by berlin
the trial of tolu is expected to proceed in absentia , and her husband , who faces similar charges , was not freed
whether europe is willing to overcome its own objections to turkey will largely depend on germany , which has been one of the key western targets of erdogans anger
the country is home to up to 3 million people with turkish parents who mostly came there as guest workers and of whom many are still allowed to vote in turkish elections
the majority of turkish-german voters support erdogans governing akp party , which has dismayed german politicians who feared that erdogans election campaign in germany could sow discord
efforts to restrict erdogans sway over the turkish diaspora population in europe have disrupted european-turkish relations to such an extent that erdogan has accused the german government of nazi practices.
the animosity those attacks provoked is unlikely to simply fade away
but europe is also aware of the risks of a more confrontational approach
located between europe and the middle east , turkey has hosted millions of syrian refugees , largely preventing them from continuing their journey to europe after a major deal was struck in 2016
and as migration fears have swept a number of far-right parties into government offices across europe , erdogan is well aware of europes need for turkish cooperation
with the turkish economy faltering , the dependency goes both ways , however
erdogan has called the leaders of the two top continental european economies germanys angela merkel and frances emmanuel macron to discuss ways to boost trade and investment ties , according to turkish summaries
and in a trump-weary europe , there appears to be a growing number of politicians who would prefer more trade over more sanctions
former german foreign minister sigmar gabriel warned in an interview with germanys rnd news agency published monday
germanys conservative party maintains that turkey would have to send a clear signal that it is willing to walk back some of its restrictive policies before any possible reset of european-turkish ties
so far , there are no signs of that
only days before the travel ban on tolu was lifted , a 46-year old german citizen was arrested by turkish authorities on terrorism charges in a separate case
