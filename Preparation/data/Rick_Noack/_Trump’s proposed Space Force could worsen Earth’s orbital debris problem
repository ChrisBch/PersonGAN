when vice president pence announced plans to create a space force military command by 2020 on thursday , social media was flooded with star trek theme music , astronaut gifs and suggestions for the space forces future logo
but to some space experts , pences de facto call to arms was less of a laughing matter
analysts estimate that 25 percent of todays space debris originated in this single 2007 test when the chinese military blasted apart one of its own weather satellites with a missile at an altitude of 537 miles
what the chinese did in 2007 had a dramatic impact , said manuel metz , a space debris expert at the german aerospace center
now imagine a real space arms race or even a full-blown conflict
more than 170 million pieces of space debris including decades-old satellites or spent rockets already orbit the earth today , with 29,000 of them being bigger than four inches
according to the european space agency , a satellite colliding with one of the 29,000 larger objects would be catastrophic , while smaller fragments could still penetrate surfaces
thats one reason nations long agreed to treat space as a largely demilitarized region
after initial experiments during the cold war , the fall of the berlin war brought almost two decades in which attacks against satellites were considered a minor risk , if at all
after 2006 , however , the bush administrations more aggressive approach and similar research activity by other nations resulted in a resurgence of concerns that space attacks could eventually become an element of conventional wars
neither china nor russia have destroyed any satellites circling earth since 2007 , but that hasnt stopped them from continuing to develop more precise weapons
there are still few specifics on what a u.s. space force would exactly focus on
but in his speech , pence specifically referenced the decade-old chinese antisatellite test , saying that it constituted a highly provocative demonstration of chinas growing capability to militarize space.
to the united states , any threats to its military satellites are unnerving because they provide crucial intelligence during military missions back on earth
elbridge colby , a senior fellow at the center for a new american security , told afp back in 2016
in fact , the u.s. military has headed some efforts in recent years to tackle the debris problem , after washington and other countries treated the orbit as a waste site for more than half a century
nasa and the u.s. military now track objects that exceed the size of four inches to predict their flight paths and move active satellites out of their way
but much of the damage may already be done , shelton feared at the time
debris doesnt simply disappear as it circles earth
instead , it collides with other objects splitting up into even more , smaller parts that can cut into satellites faster than speeding bullets
humans appear well on track to turn the earths lower orbit into a satellite kill zone even before any of their space forces have actually taken off
