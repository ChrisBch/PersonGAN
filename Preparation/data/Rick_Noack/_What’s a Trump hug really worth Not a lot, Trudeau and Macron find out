when canadian prime minister justin trudeau and french president emmanuel macron met with president trump in recent months , both hugged the president a lot , as if to demonstrate we get along really , really well , no matter what
of course , both had few illusions about their newly found friend , but amid a global hunt for a working strategy in dealing with trump , the bromance or worst best friends approach seemed worth a shot
its fair to say now that the strategy has failed
since his state visit to washington , macron has warned twice that trumps moves could result in war first , when trump withdrew from the iran deal , and again thursday after the president imposed tariffs on close u.s. allies , including france
( the visit was only 37 days ago )
trudeau , meanwhile , declared a war on the american gherkin thursday , referring to pickles , and other products , in response to the same tariffs
both macron and trudeau voiced especially harsh criticism of trump on thursday , even while other leaders who have been more at odds with trump remained somewhat less vocal
both german chancellor angela merkel and british prime minister theresa may sent representatives to condemn the tariffs rather than make a personal statement
( he later indicated that it might take place anyway )
in europe and among other u.s. allies , the double defeat of macron on iran and trade tariffs is resulting in even more uncertainty about how to approach the president
is now the time to stop playing nice for real
in interviews since macrons and merkels respective d.c. visits , european officials have indicated that this may be the next strategy thats up for debate
at a summit in mid-may , european council president donald tusk lashed out at trump over his policies regarding iran , gaza , trade tariffs and north korea
while european leaders have repeatedly stressed the need to become more self-reliant , its unclear to what lengths the continent is willing to go to confront trump
said peter beyer , coordinator of transatlantic relations for merkels conservative party
the reality in this case is that europe and canada need the united states a whole lot
but the question after a year of frustration is now increasingly how much and for how long do they still need trump
