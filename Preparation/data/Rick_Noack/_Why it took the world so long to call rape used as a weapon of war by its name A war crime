this years prize winners denis mukwege , a congolese gynecologist , and nadia murad , an iraqi yazidi would probably fall into the latter category
mukwege and murad have led the way to stop the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war , but its hard to overstate how much more work needs to be done
holding the perpetrators accountable and preventing such acts is a prerequisite for lasting peace , said berit reiss-andersen , norwegian nobel committee chair
but thats a rather new international consensus , and one that is still blatantly ignored by some nations
doing so became at least slightly more difficult in 2008 , when the united nations finally recognized rape during conflicts as a war crime
legally , the resolution may not have been as groundbreaking as reported at the time , given that the nuremberg trials and subsequent tribunals in rwanda and elsewhere had already resulted in condemnations of rape and sexual violence as crimes of war
that link itself wasnt new , given that rape had accompanied wars for centuries
but what changed in the 20th century was the emergence of a far more systematic use of it during ethnic cleansing campaigns and other conflicts a disturbing development with effects that took decades to be fully understood
early on in the century , japanese soldiers abducted hundreds of thousands of women in occupied territories and forced them into prostitution during world war ii
when the war ended , the allied forces took a number of steps to prevent a repeat of human rights abuses including rape , but sexual violence was still only mentioned as a side aspect
that changed once researchers found mounting evidence that rape itself was being used as a key weapon in the second half of the 20th century
amnesty wrote at the time
other organizations , including doctors without borders , were starting to notice a similar trend
the late 1990s and the following decade brought a new awareness for the complex repercussions of sexual violence in wars that go far beyond what was acknowledged after world war ii , including a rise in domestic violence
researchers posited that mens perceived loss of control in conflicts , if they are on the losing side , may be compensated by them resorting to domestic violence
according to a summary by unicef
but more than two decades on , there are still no systematic efforts to prosecute or prevent sexual violence in war zones
this has left individual activists and groups with the harrowing mission of dealing with the fallout in countries including south sudan , syria , iraq , burundi and many others
