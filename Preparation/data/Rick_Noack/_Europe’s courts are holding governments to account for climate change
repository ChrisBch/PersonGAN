berlin when 50,000 protesters headed to the ancient hambach forest west of germanys cologne city last weekend , interest was so great that traffic on one of the countrys high-speed autobahns came to a standstill
the rescue of the forests thousand-year-old trees was celebrated as a rare victory by environmental activists over european governments that have almost all ignored their own emissions targets in recent years
while support in european election campaigns this year for environmental parties has been on the rise from sweden to germany , it appears that there is another group forcing the governments to obey their own laws judges
on tuesday , an appeals court in the netherlands ordered officials to cut greenhouse gas emissions more rapidly than so far envisioned , handing a victory to 900 citizens who had sued the government
last month , a german court banned all old diesel vehicles from the city center of frankfurt , after germanys top administrative court had found earlier this year that the highly polluting cars could be restricted from accessing busy roads across the country
similar decisions could follow , potentially tuesday , when a berlin court is expected to make a ruling on the same grounds
several other lawsuits are still being processed , including one by a group of litigants from france , germany , sweden and other countries who argue that the e.u
's failure to force member states to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions violates the law
ironically , the e.u
itself is preparing to sue member states over their failure to cut emissions
germany , for instance , vastly exceeds its targets , which may soon turn out to be a costly endeavor
member states exceed their emissions targets , they can purchase the right to emit more from other countries that have not exhausted their limits
that way , the e.u wants to keep overall emissions limited and provide an incentive to countries to lower emissions themselves
unless it dramatically changes course , germany may have to pay $ 70 billion over the next decade to compensate for its additional emissions , according to some estimates
the countrys problem is that despite its reputation for leading the way in promoting renewable energy sources , it continues to heavily rely on coal , one of the most polluting energy sources
environmental researchers believe theres no easy fix
but as courts are assuming a more influential role in regulating emissions , what may soon matter more than feasibility is legality
