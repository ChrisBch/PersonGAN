berlin over the past 600 years , europes black sea has been one of the maritime areas hit hardest by war and nationalism
bordering turkey , russia and ukraine , among other nations , the inland body of waters trade routes were dominated by the ottoman turks after they occupied constantinople in 1453
it was a key battlefield during world war ii and has once again become contested , with ukraine and russia clashing there in recent years
but there was a time when trade flourished in the black sea
and on tuesday , european researchers revealed some stunning details about a period when greek ships crossed the bosporus strait , loaded with goods to trade and risking storms and natural disasters
one such ship has now been discovered almost completely intact at the bottom of the black sea at a depth of 1.2 miles , where oxygen levels are so low that marine life is virtually nonexistent
while animals and bacteria would usually decompose a wooden shipwrecks remains within centuries , the 75-foot-long greek shipwreck lay undisturbed for more than 2,400 years , researchers with the black sea maritime archaeology project said tuesday
the team wrote on its website
the greek trading ship was the oldest of dozens of shipwrecks that were discovered off the coast of bulgaria during the three-year project , which the team claims is the biggest effort of its kind
the findings are documented in a two-hour documentary project , which is also due to be released tuesday
using deep-sea diving robots and sonar from ships , the researchers scanned the bottom of the black sea , primarily looking for possible ruins of submerged ancient settlements to study the effects of melting glaciers on sea levels
but as they mapped over 770 square miles of seafloor , more than five dozen historic vessels almost all of them astonishingly well preserved appeared before the cameras of their remote-controlled underwater vehicles
the team believes that some of the ships were once operated by the romans , with other vessels dating to the 17th century
the team wrote in a statement
the researchers have focused in particular on the ancient greek ship , of which only a small part was removed from the original location to confirm the woods radiocarbon age
there are no plans to recover the entire wooden structure , partially over fears that it would break apart
the researchers have also not released its exact location
but the discovery could still yield some remarkable insights into an era from which few wooden remnants are still intact
