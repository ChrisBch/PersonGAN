paris nearly every western european capital has a massive , monolithic museum designed to project an image of national might and instill ordinary citizens with patriotic pride through expansive collections that stretch across time and place
in the seats of former colonial powers , these caverns of culture also reflect contested periods of history
they feature items acquired in dubious circumstances or plundered outright
and although the empires have long since collapsed , the objects have remained
the accelerated push began with french president emmanuel macron , who proclaimed while in burkina faso in november that france would work toward the temporary or permanent restitution of african heritage to africa.
the government insisted in a communique obtained by frances libration newspaper.
their restitution is not possible.
african heritage can not just be in european private collections and museums.
the museum noted
ethiopia filed a claim for the artifacts in 2008
this year , the v & a director floated returning the objects under a long-term loan agreement
germany , too , has joined the reevaluation and restitution push
the german lost art foundation , established to support investigations of nazi-looted art , announced in april that it would expand its mandate to include artifacts from former colonies
in may , the german museums association released a code of conduct to guide the research and possible restitution of colonial-era objects
for 2019 , germany has set aside $ 3.5 million to help museums determine the origins of possibly illegal or illegitimate artifacts
the culture minister wrote in a statement
meanwhile , a consortium of european museums known as the benin dialogue group has been discussing rotating loans to benin city , nigeria , of artifacts looted by the british army
all this suggests a dramatic change in attitudes
but critics wonder whether it will lead to much of an overhaul of the continents collections
they note that governments are talking less about returning artifacts with sincere apologies and more about long-term loans and joint-custody agreements
they bristle at the idea that european institutions should get to determine which claims are valid and whether other countries have adequate facilities and curatorial expertise to get back objects that were taken from them
said christian kopp of the nongovernmental organization berlin postkolonial.
we need to define what legality means in this context.
the burden of proof , kopp added , should lie with european museums and not with former colonial countries.
museums should have to prove that their acquisitions were legal , he said
in germany , pressure to research and reconcile colonial-era objects comes as berlin prepares to open a massive new ethnographic museum next year
little is known about some of the 20,000 items slated to go on display at the humboldt forum , although the curators have said they are committed to identifying items that may have been acquired illegally or unethically
said gorch pieken , curator of an exhibit and workshop space within the new museum
pieken suggested that empty display cases could raise awareness about restitution
said senegalese writer and economist felwine sarr , who along with french art historian bndicte savoy has been tapped by macron to outline a repatriation plan , expected in november
sarr is author of a 2016 book , afrotopia , that eschews western development aid and advocates for an africa that determines what it wants for itself
he sees restitution of objects taken during the colonial era as a crucial step in that evolution the objects are signifiers of stolen pasts
sarr rejects the suggestion there are not adequate facilities to receive these artifacts and dismisses security concerns
but there are other concerns at play , shared even by those who support restitution on moral grounds
but some feel privileging an objects universal value can efface the particular history in which it is inscribed , as well as the experiences of the individuals who made it
restitution , they say , is the only adequate means of honoring those histories , at least for those items known to be looted or plundered
of course , there are complexities , said louis-georges tin , a representative of black associations in france who has influenced macrons position on lost art
to restitute is difficult , tin said.
but not to restitute is even more difficult.
