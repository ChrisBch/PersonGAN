stuttgart , germany for as long as donald trump has been president , he has been threatening to slap tariffs on foreign carmakers to stop flashy german vehicles from flooding american streets
on friday , he repeated the threat and attached a specific number , tweeting about a 20 percent tariff on all automobile imports from the european union
here in stuttgart , the heartland of the german automotive industry since a couple of 19th-century engineers put the horse-drawn carriage out to pasture , a realization is setting in he just might do it
eighteen months ago , i would never have believed it , said uwe meinhardt , a union official who represents autoworkers in a city where nearly one in five employees has a job in the industry
now that trump has made good on other once-seemingly far-fetched threats against european allies , meinhardt is trying to get used to the idea that his workers may be the u.s. presidents next victims.
trump has dramatically raised trade tensions on multiple fronts , with tariffs on a range of chinese goods announced last week and the future of nafta left dangling by trumps insistence on renegotiating the 1990s-era treaty with canada and mexico
the international monetary fund recently warned that the u.s. moves were putting the global trading system at risk
in europe , car tariffs are shaping up as the next battle in what officials here fear is developing into a full-blown trade war between the united states and its closest allies
trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from the e.u. , and the e.u
on friday imposed countertariffs on u.s. goods including whisky and motorcycles
although auto tariffs would be aimed broadly at imports , with vehicles from major manufacturing hubs such as mexico , canada and japan all likely to be affected , trump has singled out german vehicles as a particular object of his ire
and studies show that germany stands to suffer more in absolute terms than any other nation exporting vehicles to the united states , with losses in the billions of dollars and a meaningful bite taken out of the nations gross domestic product
german auto giant daimler warned thursday that the tensions would hurt profits
it was the first carmaker to make such an announcement
last month , he asked the commerce department to investigate whether automotive imports constitute a threat to u.s. national security a notion that draws scorn from economists but could be employed as an alternative pretext for tariffs
trump also cited national security to justify the steel and aluminum tariffs
although europe , canada and mexico were initially exempt , the administration decided at the end of may that close allies would get the same treatment as adversaries such as china
trumps words and deeds have fed a growing conviction in germany that the vehicle tariffs , if not inevitable , are certainly possible , and that the country needs to be prepared
in an interview with the public broadcaster ard , chancellor angela merkel acknowledged that the tariffs may be coming and promised that europe would respond in kind.
one cant take advantage of us again and again , merkel warned
the tough talk is of little comfort here in stuttgart , where the prospect of a trade war with the areas most important economic partner fills residents with dread
stuttgart , a hilly city laced with vineyards in germanys prosperous southwest , lays justifiable claim to being the cradle of the automobile.
it was here in 1886 that gottlieb daimler pioneered the four-wheeled motor carriage.
working just up the road , karl benz was on to something similar
the corporate heir to their discoveries manufacturer of the mercedes-benz is still based here , as is porsche
the region is packed with assembly plants , parts makers and engineering firms all supporting an industry that is considered a pride of the nation
yet , despite healthy profits , all is not well for the automakers
the volkswagen diesel-emissions scandal tarnished the reputation of the entire industry , and german carmakers have been considered slow to shift to hybrid or electric vehicles
now , their business with two of their most important markets could be disrupted britain because of brexit and the united states because of tariffs
other german manufacturers including bmw , volkswagen and mercedes owner daimler have significantly boosted production capabilities in the united states over the past decade and are considered somewhat less vulnerable to tariffs
german companies american plants and subcontractors employed more than 110,000 workers and had an output of more than 800,000 vehicles last year , according to the german automotive industry association
that compares with about 500,000 cars exported from germany to the united states
the tariffs would knock about $ 6 billion , or nearly 0.2 percent of gdp , out of the german economy through lost sales and profits on cars imported directly from germany , according to a study by the munich-based ifo center for international economics
tariffs will cost the german automakers market share
thats very clear , said gabriel felbermayr , the centers director
the automakers exposure does not end there
about 500,000 cars were exported to the united states from german plants in other countries , such as mexico , meaning a breakdown of nafta could compound the damage
german manufacturers also export cars made in the united states bmw boasts that it is the largest u.s. auto exporter by value so they could be caught in the crossfire if the united states and china escalate their spat
the united states , too , stands to lose as trade barriers grow , felbermayr noted
that is the message german officials have been trying to send , to little avail
nicole hoffmeister-kraut , the economy minister in the state of baden-wrttemberg , where stuttgart is the capital , said the areas prosperity should be an advertisement for the virtues of free trade
the region may send many goods to the united states , but it is also a major purchaser of u.s. services , particularly in technology
hoffmeister-kraut said the united states and the e.u
should be negotiating lower trade barriers , not unilaterally raising them a point other german officials and the automakers themselves have echoed
yet some here say they can see trumps point of view , even if they do not care for his combative style
balkis said he would like to see both sides reduce , and perhaps eliminate , their barriers
other executives supplying the auto industry said they , too , would not mind that
but they cautioned that a more equitable set of tariffs will not necessarily mean more american cars on european roads or fewer european cars on american roads
mixed in with the concern is also a supreme confidence in the superiority of german engineering
