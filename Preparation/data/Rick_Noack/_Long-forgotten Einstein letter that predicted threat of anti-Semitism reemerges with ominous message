berlin after legendary physicist albert einstein fled the german capital , berlin , in 1922 in fear and haste , he penned a letter that has lost little of its relevance since , even almost 100 years later
einstein wrote in the long-forgotten letter that was sold for more than $ 30,000 at an auction in jerusalem on tuesday
addressed to his sister maria , einsteins 1922 thoughts today serve as a powerful reminder that the holocaust was preceded by years of mounting anti-semitic attacks and the demonization of jews
it didnt come out of nowhere
after 1922 , it took the nazis another decade to seize power
but einsteins jewish background had made him a target of attacks early on
he decided to embark on a spontaneous trip abroad when his jewish friend , german foreign minister walter rathenau , was assassinated that year
einstein wrote from an undisclosed location , likely as he was fleeing the country
even though einstein had correctly assessed the rise of anti-semitism by the early 1920s , the scientist was wrong about the impact on his own life , repeatedly assuring his friends and colleagues that they should not worry about his safety
dont worry about me , i myself dont worry either , einstein wrote in his letter
the famous physicist later returned to germany and won the nobel prize
but in 1933 , when einstein happened to be in the united states , adolf hitler took power in germany
einstein had to admit that he would never be able to return safely and renounced his german citizenship
einsteins multifaceted approach toward religion and his more xenophobic and misogynistic beliefs revealed in his diaries are still the subject of debate
but his warnings against intolerance and anti-semitism left little room for misinterpretation
they write , have caused a certain corrosion of jewish life
since the reports release in april , anti-semitic incidents have further increased across europe , with a 69 percent jump in france so far this year
the spike in attacks against minorities is not limited to jews , as muslims have also become more frequent targets
amid figures that indicate a shift toward more intolerance , some have searched for historical lessons that may be relevant today
austrias national film archive , for instance , this year restored a pre-world war ii silent film that sparked furious reactions in the mid-1920s for warning against the scapegoating of jews
long believed to be lost , the city without jews was surprisingly rediscovered in a paris flea market three years ago
the painstaking restoration took years of work
said nikolaus wostry , managing director of austrias national film archive
as researchers seek explanations for the recent surge in intolerance , the answers for which they are looking may also be found in documents long lost or forgotten
