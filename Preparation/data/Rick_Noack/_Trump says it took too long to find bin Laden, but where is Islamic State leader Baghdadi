after mostly avoiding getting dragged into the partisan fights between president trump and his opponents , the u.s. military faced an uncomfortable reality this month theres no easy escape from washingtons battles
thousands of troops were moved to the u.s.-mexico border just before the midterm elections as trump warned of a looming invasion , even as his critics cautioned that the decision was a campaign ploy
and just as it was reported monday that some of those soldiers may be ordered back from the border in the coming days ahead of most migrants arrival there , trump escalated a separate spat that may further infuriate advocates of a politically independent military
over the weekend , the commander in chief took aim at retired adm. william h. mcraven one of the militarys most revered navy seal and special operations commanders who oversaw the killing of osama bin laden and the capture of saddam hussein
of course we should have captured osama bin laden long before we did
i pointed him out in my book just before the attack on the world trade center
president clinton famously missed his shot
we paid pakistan billions of dollars & they never told us he was living there
baghdadis death has been reported multiple times since the islamic states territorial retreat sped up in 2016 , but audio recordings suggest that he is still alive
but despite trumps attacks on his predecessors and u.s. military leaders over bin laden , there is one question trump has not publicly asked since assuming office where is baghdadi , and why hasnt he been captured
some of the most recent intelligence by u.s.-allied partners in the region suggests that any answer would involve the painstaking and years-long work that is almost always needed to track down top militant commanders such as bin laden or baghdadi
the commander said iraqs latest intelligence indicates the militant leader is moving between the sparsely populated desert regions that straddle syria and iraqs borders in areas that have yet to be secured by iraqi or syrian forces
despite losing the territory it controlled in iraq by december 2017 , the islamic state still maintains pockets of influence along the lengthy border with syria and in villages inside iraqs sunni heartland
the group has recently mounted low-level terrorist attacks in places from which it has been evicted , such as mosul , ramadi and tikrit
both bin laden and baghdadi have succeeded in erasing most of their traces
while bin laden was involved in the day-to-day operations of his al-qaeda group before the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , the subsequent u.s. focus on capturing or killing him forced him to become a more subdued and symbolic figure
keeping a low profile , bin laden worked on a broad strategy for the group
baghdadi has kept an even lower profile , with only one public appearance even before a u.s.-led coalition intervened in syria and iraq
the intervention which has mostly consisted of airstrikes and some u.s. ground forces operations inside syria and iraq was launched under president barack obama and continued by trump
while trump has publicly pondered withdrawing ground troops , he has not followed through , heeding the advice of top military commanders
human rights organizations have cautioned that the u.s.-led operation , which has been celebrated in the united states as a military success , took a horrendous toll on civilians in formerly islamic state-controlled cities such as raqqa in northern syria
although it helped local forces win back about 95 percent of territory previously held by the islamic state , some of the groups top leaders remain at large
with the islamic state turning into a more guerrilla-style terrorist group , tracking the militants down may not become easier
american and allied syrian and iraqi forces have been slow to transition from combat to the more intensive intelligence operations needed to target the clandestine islamic state remnants
the last time the islamic state claimed to have released an audio message by baghdadi was in august , to mark the muslim eid al-adha holiday and to urge the groups sympathizers to keep up the fight
the islamic state leader had been silent for almost a year before the 54-minute august address
he said in august
amid u.s. and u.n. estimates that up to 30,000 islamic state supporters could still be in iraq and syria , his message likely also applies to u.s. efforts to locate the city , village or remote stretch of land where baghdadi may be hiding
