berlin when britain voted to leave the european union about two years ago , the big question was who will be next
these days , its actually more like whos next to join
while the british government under prime minister theresa may is split over its strategy to exit the bloc and still struggles to agree on core issues with less than a year left before its departure date , the e.u
is now more popular than ever
a new , extensive survey published wednesday by the e.u.s public opinions office found 67 percent of e.u
citizens believe membership in the bloc benefits them
it is the highest score measured since the e.u
was formed under its current name in 1993
in 2010 , only about half of all citizens agreed that the e.u
had benefited them
the blocs popularity also suffered further during the refugee influx in 2015 and 2016
years of responding to political catastrophes including brexit and greeces debt crisis have taught e.u
officials a certain sense of humility
in recent weeks , however , the e.u
appears to have regained self-confidence in line with its new public support , even though the bolder remarks coming out of e.u
headquarters in brussels may not be aligned with its actual power in the world
trumps shoulder-shrugging may be justified he holds an office that is considered the most powerful one in the world , while tusk heads a council that is dependent on 28 individual , often disagreeing governments
britain was among the nations that most often disagreed resulting in the unprecedented decision to exit in 2016
today , however , 53 percent of respondents there still say that the country has on balance benefited from being a member of the e.u.
only 29 percent said the opposite was the case , even though 51 percent voted to leave two years ago
survey may not foreshadow a sudden brexit reversal other studies still show that many brits want to leave regardless of whether membership has benefited them economically but it does indicate that the rather chaotic brexit preparations seem to have deterred others
in neighboring ireland , there are concerns that the reintroduction of border controls after britain leaves the single market could result in a flare-up of violence near northern ireland , which belongs to the united kingdom
as those concerns mount , 91 percent of the irish now believe that the e.u
has benefited them
in debt-ridden italy , only 44 percent agreed with that assertion , even though support for the e.u
there and in greece is on the rise , too
another reason for europes resurgence could be a string of verbal attacks on the continent from the white house
trumps threats over defense spending , the iran deal and trade tariffs have snubbed european governments , but they now also serve as the prime example of why the e.u
is needed , officials here say
said peter beyer , coordinator of transatlantic relations for german chancellor angela merkels conservative party , in an interview last week
his concerns appeared to be proved correct on tuesday , when poland announced that it would defend the u.s. withdrawal from the iran deal , despite continuous e.u
support for that agreement
britain issued a joint statement with france and germany after trump withdrew from the deal , but such coordinated efforts could become rarer in the future
while macron and merkel are teaming up at a time when many here consider joint responses the only way to get trumps attention , britain is preparing its solo run
sometimes , you dont know what youve got till its gone
