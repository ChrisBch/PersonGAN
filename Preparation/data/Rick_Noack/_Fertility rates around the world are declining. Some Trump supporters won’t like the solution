almost half of all countries have fertility rates below the replacement level , according to an unprecedented study published by the lancet journal
while there was not a single nation with a fertility rate below the 2.05 threshold back in 1950 , the global average is now only 2.4 down from 4.7 about 70 years ago
differences between nations have become more pronounced , with some european countries having record-low rates , down to one child per woman on average , compared to more than six children in some african nations
if you live in a poorer nation with high fertility rates , a decrease would probably be a reason for celebration
lower fertility rates are often the result of fewer child deaths , easily accessible contraception and prosperous economies , which explains why europe , north america and wealthier asian nations such as japan are disproportionately affected
in countries with below-replacement level fertility rates , however , the costs outweigh the benefits
europe has struggled with this challenge for years
even more so than the united states , european welfare largely depends on a sufficient number of working-age residents who can finance health care , pensions and social security for everyone
the fewer there are , the more complicated it becomes to sustain a system that was set up in a century when falling fertility rates were among the problems people had to worry least about
alarmed by continuously dropping figures , some e.u
governments have taken drastic measures
italys health ministry launched an advertisement campaign about two years ago to remind citizens that sept. 22 was fertility day.
other countries have sought to address the issue by focusing on education
denmark , for instance , has started teaching schoolchildren that having babies doesnt only come with risks but also with benefits
instead , they argue , an increasingly large share of the worlds population may have to come to terms with higher retirement ages , slashed benefits and above all probably the most divisive issue of this century so far migration
falling fertility rates do not immediately have to result in receding population numbers , as migration and better health care also impact overall figures , according to the study that was funded by the bill & melinda gates foundation
while almost half of all nations now have fertility rates below the replacement level , population growth declined in only 33 countries from 2010 to 2017
the countries where population figures remained steady despite lower fertility rates also experienced a higher influx of migrants
the fertility rate in the united states is actually also below replacement levels at 1.8 , yet the population is still growing , thanks in large part to immigration
it takes one generation until the population actually starts to decline , said christopher murray , who worked on the study
despite the time delay , theres another factor that has so far saved the united states from following the fate of europes aging societies migration
the recent fall in net migration has already slowed u.s. population growth and could eventually accelerate a negative trend
in some places
based on that analysis , slashing migration numbers as the trump administration is attempting to do and operating a budget that relies on a young workforce appears contradictory
other countries are increasingly aware of that
confronted with a record-low fertility rate , japan decided to relax some of its residency laws this months
said murray , stressing that the united states is still in a better position than many other developed nations where fertility rates dropped below replacement levels decades ago
northern europes financial benefits are already much more generous than u.s. benefits , however
with the trump administrations recent proposals to slash childrens health insurance programs and to toughen immigration laws , its a conclusion that will not sit well among many voters in the united states
