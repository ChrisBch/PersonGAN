ludwigsburg , germany before allied forces liberated nazi germany and the survivors of adolf hitlers labor and death camps more than 70 years ago , tens of thousands of nazis who were directly involved in the holocaust disappeared
some escaped abroad
others hid in german cities , moving into houses with people they would have sent to their deaths under the hitler regime
few of them faced justice until now , perhaps
at least 23 alleged nazi criminals who are believed to have worked in death camps were already facing charges in germany and austria by june , marking a dramatic increase , compared with previous decades
on tuesday , the white house announced that it had deported 95-year-old jakiw palij , the last known alleged former nazi labor camp guard living in the united states
palij is not facing charges , but prosecutors said that they were looking for more evidence that would justify criminal proceedings
the resident of the queens borough of new york was arrested monday and deported to germany early tuesday , according to the u.s. embassy in berlin
palij was moved to a nursing home upon arrival in the city of dsseldorf , germanys frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported
in a statement , u.s. officials indicated that the deportation was the result of negotiations by president trump and his team and collaborative efforts with a key european ally , germany
palij was born in what today constitutes ukraine but was part of poland at the time
after the end of world war ii , he left europe for the united states , where he became a citizen in 1957 by hiding his nazi past
but 17 years ago , in 2001 , palij admitted his involvement with the nazi ss , hitlers feared paramilitary organization
palij admitted to u.s. officials in 2001 that he was trained at the ss paramilitary camp in the town of trawniki where units were specifically prepared to participate in the holocaust
the now-95-year-old also worked at trawnikis labor camp the same year the nazis massacred 6,000 jews there
palij has maintained that he did not participate in any killings , and german prosecutors currently believe that it is impossible to prove his involvement
palijs deportation appears to have been the result of pressure by the trump administration , rather than by german authorities
u.s. officials took away palijs citizenship in 2003 , and the former nazi guard lost an appeals process two years later , but administrative challenges dragged on until now because it was unclear to which country palij should be deported
american courts were unable to charge palij because his alleged crimes occurred abroad , and all three european countries where prosecutors would have had more jurisdiction germany , ukraine and poland refused to accept the former guard
in an interview with fox newss fox & friends taped wednesday , trump said he took action after previous presidents had not
i have a lot of jewish friends who said to me about this man living in queens i grew up in queens , the president said
and he was a man that not just a prison guard
he was a prison guard that supervised the killing of many , many jews
many , many jews
and hes lived here for decades
now hes an old man , hes 95 years old
and the obama administration was unable to pull it off
and , frankly , the bush administration was unable to pull it off
and i was able to pull it off.
the germans saw this as a moral obligation that they had , not so much a legal obligation , grenell said , referring to palij not being a german citizen
in germany , palijs case will be handled by the countrys nazi crimes authority , based in the city of ludwigsburg , where officials said on tuesday that the likelihood of a trial against palij was low
the agency is currently focusing at a number of cases that are more likely to result in a trial
all of the agencys suspects are in their 90s , and some are likely to die ahead of any sentencing or could be declared unfit to stand trial
more than 70 years on , there is little time to be lost it could be the last chance for nazi criminals to face justice for crimes that continue to represent the worst of mankind
rommel said in an interview in june
in recent years , though , weve made some remarkable progress , he said
there was little reason for such enthusiasm only a few years ago , after german prosecutors for decades faced hurdles that made it impossible to charge a wide range of suspects despite evidence of their nazi past
elizabeth barry white , a senior historian with the u.s
holocaust memorial museum in washington , explained last year
high-ranking nazi officers were often charged with lesser offenses only because their direct responsibility for the killing of one or more individuals could not be proved based on the narrow german jurisdiction
in many cases , lower-ranking guards or soldiers such as palij were not even prosecuted at all
a new approach was needed , and it came after a court convicted former nazi guard john demjanjuk in 2011
before 2011 , prosecutors needed to provide evidence that guards had themselves murdered jews or other nazi opponents
but the demjanjuk verdict was based on a dramatically different approach his mere presence at the nazi death camp was sufficient to establish responsibility for the killing
demjanjuk later appealed the sentence but died before a court could evaluate his claims
the new legal frameworks viability was proved only two years ago when another former guard lost his appeal following a similar sentence
at the time , many feared that it may also have been the last
rommel and his colleagues mainly rely on documents found in archives or in memorial sites of former death camps
the units eight investigators then painstakingly compare the entries found in equipment or sick lists to establish a suspects identity
once theyve found a possible match , rommels team checks whether the individual could still be alive
in 95 percent of cases , this isnt the case , rommel said
in the agencys basement , tens of thousands of paper documents are stored that include details on convicts or clues that may eventually provide the identities of more suspects
its the worlds most comprehensive database of nazi criminals
but because german authorities assumed that active cases were going to drop , the archives were never digitalized
the agencys bureaucratic paper trail isnt the only challenge
cases are also slowed because the ludwigsburg-based nazi crimes agency handles only early-stage investigations that are later taken over by local prosecutors
investigators arent sure how long they will be able to continue their work , because of the advanced age of the identified suspects
walking through his agencys headquarters , surrounded by thousands of files with details on the nazi criminals he and his predecessors hunted , rommel acknowledged that the job had taken a personal toll on the investigators , especially as time is now running out
