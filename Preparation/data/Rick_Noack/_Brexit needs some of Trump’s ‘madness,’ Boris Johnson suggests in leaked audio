imagine trump doing brexit , british foreign secretary boris johnson told a group of conservative listeners wednesday night
for most of continental europe , this would likely involve images of chaos , disaster , shattered alliances
but for britains top diplomat , in comments leaked to buzzfeed news , there is method in trumps madness that could serve as a role model for johnsons side of the atlantic
the british foreign office did not respond to a request for comment on friday
the intervention essentially pits johnson against his boss , prime minister theresa may , who is pursuing a more low-key and cautious path
adopting a trump approach may also be difficult for may because she has been one of the victims of his style herself
europes three most powerful leaders french president emmanuel macron , german chancellor angela merkel and may are expected to find themselves on the same side of the negotiation table on friday at the group of seven meeting in canada , united against trump
referring to their dispute over tariffs and the iran nuclear deal , macron warned thursday that the u.s. president may be isolated at the meeting
but johnson , of course , is not your ordinary foreign secretary
while already in office , the conservative politician once said that it would take too long to apologize for the rich thesaurus of insults he has thrown at world leaders
in 2016 , for instance , he wrote a poem in which he called turkish president recep tayyip erdogan a terrific wankerer.
johnson has offended a few more world leaders since , but project brexit which brexiteers hope will make britain a force to reckon with again is continuing undeterred
or at least it was , until recently
negotiations with the european union have faltered , as may is facing a divided cabinet over the countrys post-brexit customs and irish border plans
may wants to avoid border checks to prevent a resurgence of violence in northern ireland and to satisfy her political allies there , whom she needs in order to stay in power
brexiteers fear that may could eventually settle on what appears to be the easiest option staying in the single market , which would force britain to abide by e.u
rules , even though it would no longer have the power to shape them
that solution would raise the question of why britain has exposed itself to years of negotiations only to acknowledge that it may not be as self-reliant as it had hoped it could be
meanwhile , remainers fear that brexiteers resistance to compromise with the e.u
could lead to a breakdown in talks with the european union potentially resulting in a no-deal brexit
some more apocalyptic studies predict that this could result in widespread chaos , with flights grounded , trade coming to a near-standstill and britain running out of medical supplies and food within weeks
( in the leaked recording , johnson ridiculed warnings over border disruptions as pure millennium bug stuff.
the damage would not be limited to britain , though
it would also affect continental europe , which is why johnson appeared to advocate risking a breakdown in talks
it would be a kind of a no-deal brexit threat , inspired by trumps cancellation of the june 12 summit with north korean leader kim jong un and his reversal of that decision only a week later
johnson said , according to buzzfeed
