months before devastating wildfires caused havoc in california , firefighters from across europe headed to sweden as authorities there struggled to extinguish several massive blazes
sweden is one of the continents greenest countries , and officials there eventually got so desperate that they ordered an air force jet to drop a bomb in the middle of the wildfires center to deprive the blaze of oxygen
the finnish forest association recently concluded in a report
in sweden , officials were stymied by their neighbors luck weather maps showed that both countries were adversely affected by the same rare , extreme heat this summer
viewed from space , the differences appeared especially striking
as all of finlands neighboring countries , including russia , battled massive blazes , the skies over finland were smoke-free
but it wasnt really luck , finnish researchers soon let everyone know
instead , finland has one of the worlds most successful strategies to counter wildfires , and it is now being more closely examined in other nations recently struck by large-scale fires
a look at trumps a-plus weekend finnish leaf-raking , 'pleasure , calif. , and adam schitt
the finnish president confirmed that he discussed wildfire prevention with trump , but rejected the suggestion that raking ever came up
the forest service in finland does carry out controlled burns of the forest floor mostly to clear away underbrush and also promote new saplings
researchers arent sure whether the countrys approach can really hold any lessons for california , however , given that parts of finland are located close to the arctic circle and have prolonged periods of rain and snow
whereas below-average precipitation is still the exception in finland , it has become the new normal in california
allowing some burns and clearing away undergrowth are also part of federal forest policy in california
in fact , some of the areas hit in the california fires burned 10 years earlier , so there hadnt been a major build up of undergrowth
no , the key factor in californias vulnerability to fires ( and finlands resistance ) appears to have to do with weather
the two countries are on very different trajectories , as finnish scientists predict the annual number of days with a wildfire risk to increase by perhaps as little as 10 percent by 2100
according to some estimates , wildfires may burn almost 80 percent more area in california by 2050 than at the moment
finland does , however , offer an instructive example to its nordic neighbors
it has managed to bring down the area annually destroyed by wildfires from sometimes more than 100,000 hectares a century ago to now less than 1 percent of that
that compares to 25,000 hectares lost in sweden this summer
researchers say that finland has a far denser road network than other nations in the region , which creates barriers to the expansion of the blazes
lakes and rivers are abundant , too
with many of the california fires happening near population centers now , a lack of roads is probably not the issue
perhaps the most striking difference with california is of a historical nature northern europe is greener today than it was 100 years ago , whereas california has lost about half of its big trees
europes medieval and industrial revolution-era need for wood turned former forest areas into grasslands , especially in southern finland
when reforestation became a more serious concern , finland split up future forests into small compartments
one side effect of this was fewer wildfires , as blazes usually dont spread beyond a single compartment , with borders that are usually marked by wide paths or by trees with different heights
although that approach may work in other european countries with similar histories , california is facing a climate-change challenge that it cant confront itself
