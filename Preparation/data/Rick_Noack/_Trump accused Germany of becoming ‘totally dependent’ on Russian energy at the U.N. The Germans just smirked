berlin out of president trumps speech at the u.n. general assembly on tuesday , it probably wont be the script that will be remembered by diplomats but , rather , world leaders laughter , caught on camera and shared in viral videos
german foreign minister heiko maas could be seen smirking alongside his colleagues
it wasnt the first time trump had lashed out at germany over its gas imports from russia
germany is indeed russias biggest export market in europe for gas , with a dependency that may grow further once nord stream 2 is finished
the pipeline would roughly double russias export volume via the baltic sea route
consecutive german governments have defended the plans , saying the offshore pipeline between russia and germany would cut energy costs and establish a reliable supply route
but nations such as poland and ukraine fear that russia may be diversifying its gas routes into europe to exploit its grid for political reasons
in june 2014 , amid the fallout over the russian annexation of ukraines crimean peninsula months earlier , russia cut off ukraines gas supplies for weeks in what kiev called a blackmail attempt
poland , ukraine and other nations east of germany hope that trumps criticisms will help them make their case
german chancellor angela merkel acknowledged for the first time in april that nord stream 2 was not driven by business interests alone but also by political motivations
while she has appeared to be opening up to criticism from central and eastern europe in recent months , merkel has not attempted to stop the plans
even if she changed course , it would be far from certain that the social democrats her key coalition partners , who have a long record of favoring stronger ties to russia would agree
the social democrats and other merkel allies have publicly speculated about another possible reason for trumps unexpected interjection the united states own business interests
u.s. gas producers have long been seeking new export markets for liquefied natural gas but have found it difficult to enter the european market , where cheaper russian gas has been easily available
trumps attacks havent changed that calculus
after his july remarks , merkel responded that she may be in a better position to judge her countrys dependence than the current u.s. president
she said at the time
on tuesday , after yet another trump warning , her top diplomats had only a smirk to offer
