with time officially running out thursday at 8 p.m. , florida counties are in the midst of a dramatic recount to determine the winners in three statewide races
one week after the midterm elections , the outcome of several key votes is still unclear , which has triggered comparisons with the 2000 recount of florida votes during the presidential election between george w. bush and al gore
its likely that the uncertainty may drag on even longer than first estimated , as several counties have asked for extensions
ballots mailed from abroad are being counted until friday
but amalee mccoys wont be among them
the 42-year-old u.s. citizen who has lived abroad for almost three decades sent in her ballot from thailand on oct. 17 , using registered mail
we kept a copy of the tracking number as i was concerned about reports of voter suppression during early voting already happening in the news , said mccoy , who lives in bangkok but votes in osceola county , fla
in previous years , voting from abroad posed few challenges , she said
but this year , things went differently
when nov. 5 rolled around , i started to wonder about if my ballot had been received , mccoy said
when she checked online , she saw that her vote had reached john f. kennedy international airport in new york on oct. 25
it disappeared without a trace until nov. 8
my husband sent me a photo of my returned absentee ballot , that he had just received in the mail at our home in bangkok , mccoy recalled
not deliverable as addressed
mccoy has shared her case with the democrats abroad in thailand organization and has alerted local officials in the united states but says she has received no explanation of why her ballot never reached its destination
im also a thai citizen , and i find it highly ironic that i have more faith that my vote will be received , registered and counted in the upcoming national elections here in february , mccoy said
thailand has hung in the balance between dictatorship and democracy in recent years
with an estimated 2.6 million americans living abroad who can vote , according to the federal voter assistance program , the broader question to many is why the united states makes it so hard for them to participate in elections
there are a number of challenges , including varying deadlines , delays in registrations and the risks of international mailing
some try others dont even bother
to vote abroad as an american , you usually need to register and request an absentee ballot by downloading and filling out a form called federal post card application that is available on the federal voting assistance programs website
youll probably have to print and return it by mail , though some states accept fax or email
next , make sure that form has arrived at its destination
( if it hasnt , you may be able to obtain a federal write-in absentee ballot with the help of your embassy or consulate )
then comes the crucial part of voting
dont miss the deadlines
allow plenty of time for the ballot to be mailed
and be prepared for surprises that may emerge in the process
turnout among eligible americans living abroad stood at only 4 percent in the 2014 midterms , compared with over 36 percent overall
other countries do a better job
during the first round of presidential elections last year , a stunning 44 percent of french citizens living abroad cast their ballot
thats eight percentage points more than the overall turnout during the 2014 u.s. midterms
france has come up with innovative solutions to make sure foreign voters arent left behind , including the creation of political offices designed to represent citizens abroad
in 2010 , the country created 11 foreign constituencies with their own representatives in the french parliament
a french citizen last registered in paris but living in london , for example , wont have to vote for a parisian anymore but can instead choose a northern european french lawmaker who regularly travels there and has local offices across the region
right now , that member of parliament is alexandre holroyd , a politician aligned with president emmanuel macrons centrist party
the democratic representation of the french community meets two objectives first , it ensures that our citizens remain attached to our political community and concerned by our political life , making them our countrys ambassadors everywhere in the world , he said
and second , it conveys a clear message political and civil rights are more than just about residency
they are about citizenship , holroyd added
frances push to better represent citizens living abroad didnt pass without controversy , as some claimed that the new system would favor the conservative party
those concerns turned out to be baseless , however , as votes ended up being more evenly shared than initially predicted
the benefit of having french members of parliament for china or north america , for instance , is the inclusiveness of that approach
we care about every vote , no matter who you are or where you live
but there are more ways to increase international participation
while the united states does not allow its citizens to vote in embassies , many other western nations , including france and sweden , do
interest was enormous during french presidential elections last year , with long lines of eager voters reported in front of some consulates and embassies
thousands showed up at a polling place in montreal , forming a one-mile-long line
photographers captured similar scenes at other french polling places around the world
the voting lines are huge
we 've been here for 1.5 hours mtl frenchelection france montreal
some americans think its time for the united states to replicate that approach
i definitely think that the u.s. should allow american citizens to vote at u.s. embassies , said mccoy , the bangkok-based voter whose ballot never made it to florida
with a prior turnout of 4 percent , there isnt a lot to lose
