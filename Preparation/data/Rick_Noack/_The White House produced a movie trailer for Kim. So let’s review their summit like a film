note ahead of president trumps press conference on tuesday , the white house showed a trailer describing the decision north korean leader kim jong un now appeared to face lead his country into a great future or into destruction
the company behind it
destiny productions a company made up by the white house , even though a small u.s. production company with the same name does exist
journalists initially suspected the video to be propaganda , but trump later posted it on his twitter account
he had previously shown it to kim who himself remarked earlier during the summit that many people may think of their meeting as being from a science fiction movie.
so maybe its time to treat this whole summit like a movie and review it
a very special bond , released june 2018
both have already indicated that they might be interested in expanding their on-screen partnership
top or flop
in their debut , kim jong un ( played by kim jong un ) and donald j. trump ( played by donald j. trump ) deliver a powerful political statement about international politics that could hardly be timelier
described by some viewers as bizarre , a very special bond may be received both as a message of hope and as a warning of how easily authoritarian rulers can restore their international standing
as in many trump and kim movies , a little less may have been more
its scenes like kim trying to take a glimpse at the inside of trumps cadillac that unnecessarily blur the lines between thriller and dark comedy
the movie starts slowly , with months of tiring back-and-forth with a real-time display of trumps twitter feed in a corner of the screen
trump tweets lines such as it wont happen , only to later find out that it had happened kim tested nuclear missiles capable of reaching the u.s. mainland
that sets the scene for former basketball star dennis rodman to travel to north korea and give kim a copy of trumps the art of the deal , but he too fails to stop kims provocations
in a nail-biting sequence , kim and trump compare the sizes of their nuclear buttons and threaten each other with destruction
after their posturing , they agree that it would be better to talk first
the world breathes a sigh of relief
yet nothing is easy in this thriller , and in a dramatic turn , trump suddenly cancels their scheduled meeting after north korea calls his deputy a political dummy , once more throwing the fate of the world into doubt
days later , the meeting is back on
the movie plot may strike some viewers as unlikely , especially with its exaggerated happy ending that has trump and kim shaking hands ahead of a private stroll through singapore gardens , while rodman weeps with joy on u.s. television
it is only then that trump delivers his famous words , claiming to have developed a very special bond with kim
the line could be understood as a reference to an earlier hit trump released just days before in which one of his advisers condemns former u.s. ally and canadian prime minister justin trudeau to a very special place in hell.
so trump and kim commit to decrease tensions , but ultimately the ending is left somewhat open , offering plenty of room for that hollywood staple , the blockbuster sequel
trump and kim both convince with a performance that could hardly be any closer to reality
most of trumps praise for kim may strike observers who are aware of north koreas human rights record as inappropriate
despite its concessions on nuclear matters , the kim regime is still accused of incarcerating tens of thousands of prisoners under inhumane conditions in camps that have been compared to nazi concentration camps by judges and u.n. experts
will there be a follow-up
almost certainly , yes
quite possibly , it will be set in the white house
