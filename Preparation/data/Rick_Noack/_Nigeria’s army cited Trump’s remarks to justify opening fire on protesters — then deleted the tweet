but his words were also heard much farther away from washington in nigeria , where trump has a higher approval rating than anywhere else in africa
on friday , the nigerian army took to twitter to defend its decision to open fire at shiite protesters in the capital , abuja by citing trump
trump said in his nov. 1 remarks
the tweet has since been deleted
it was published the same week that nigerian army troops opened fire on a march of protesters belonging to the islamic movement of nigeria ( imn ) , who were demanding the release of their jailed leader , ibrahim el-zakzaky
imn represents many members of nigerias shiite minority and opposes the use of violence
after zakzakys arrest in 2015 , the nigerian government accused him of an assassination attempt against the countrys army chief of staff
zakzaky denies those allegations
during zakzakys arrest , nigerian soldiers are believed to have killed hundreds more members of the group
imn says that at least 42 people were killed by nigerian forces on monday and tuesday
the nigerian army did not respond to a request for comment
the latest violence is part of a broader crackdown by the nigerian government on the countrys shiite minority and has triggered international condemnations
imn youth leader muhammed ibrahim gamawa told reuters
but hours later the nigerian army tweeted out trumps remarks
trumps repeated attacks on the media have made it harder for diplomats abroad to defend press freedom
on trade , the president has weakened the standing of the world trade organization by ignoring its trade war warnings and confronting china
that decision could still have broader implications in the future by preventing other disputes from being solved , with trump blamed for breaking the international consensus first
trumps at times friendly treatment of north korean leader kim jong un has also raised questions in other authoritarian nations about whether trump values personal ties more than actual progress on improving human rights records , previously a cornerstone of u.s. diplomacy
overall , trumps america first approach has satisfied the needs of some rulers , but it has left the united states far more isolated than in previous decades
diplomats working abroad complain that the united states may still be shaping global politics , but its no longer controlling the message
fridays now-deleted tweet by the nigerian army is just the latest example of that
