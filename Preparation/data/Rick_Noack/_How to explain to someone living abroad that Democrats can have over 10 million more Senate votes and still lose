berlin as europeans woke up to the results of the 2018 midterm elections on wednesday , their primary question what next for a president who is so deeply unpopular here
remained largely unanswered
but european news networks still dedicated hours-long specials to the key vote
and while viewers here tried to make sense of the results , they repeatedly stumbled over two numbers the total votes for democratic and republican senate candidates
more than 45 million americans voted for democratic senate candidates vs. about 33 million for republican contenders , according to figures updated around 11 a.m. eastern time wednesday
as the animated tv graphics clearly showed , though , it was republicans who ended the night in control of the senate not the democrats.
an extraordinary electoral system , tweeted an incredulous state secretary in the german state of hesse
so how could democrats outpace republicans by more than 10 million votes and still fall further behind in the senate
the answer is that theres really no such thing as a nationwide senate vote
it all comes down to which states are electing senators
as my colleague max j. rosenthal explained , only a third of senate seats come up for reelection each time there are congressional elections ( thats every two years )
this year , 26 of the 35 of the seats being contested were held by democrats , so more democratic voters showed up to the polls
a lot of those voters cast ballots in states where democrats were safe think new york , virginia or minnesota so there wasnt much media coverage
from a european perspective , though , some questions remain namely , why set elections up like this and not simply based on the overall popular vote , as is the case in many democracies
in the case of the senate , it goes all the way back to the drafting of the u.s. constitution in 1789
creating a new form of government required compromises of all kinds to get enough states to approve the document
one of them was to create a legislature with two chambers , one that gave each state equal representation and one that based representation on a states population
having a congress solely based on population , which some people argue for today , was one of the stalled ideas that led to this compromise
that system remains in place today in large part because its part of the constitution , which is difficult to amend
opponents wouldnt be able to change the system simply by passing a new law
in other countries , all of this is often seen as evidence that u.s. democracy no longer works properly.
farewell to the biggest pseudo-democracy in the world , read a recent headline in austrias der standard newspaper
it ran atop an opinion piece discussing americas underdeveloped electoral system.
but as much as europeans may be puzzled by those rules , seemingly undemocratic rules are not unique to the united states
britains electoral system favors bigger parties over smaller ones and still has not gotten rid of its unelected house of lords , the upper house of parliament
the difference between those examples and the senate , however , is their respective influence
the senate plays a critical role in the u.s. government , while the upper houses of most european democracies do little to affect policy decisions
