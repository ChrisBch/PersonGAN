before french marathon swimmer benoit lecomte began his six-month-long attempt tuesday to become the first to swim across the pacific ocean , he prepared for a number of possible challenges such as sharks , extremely cold water and plastic smog.
thats the term scientists use to describe billions of pieces of microplastic in the sea
in the pacific , the biggest accumulation of plastic smog is about the size of germany , france and britain combined and lecomte will swim right through it
he already swam across the atlantic ocean over two decades ago , but this latest attempt in the pacific isnt only focused on athleticism
while lecomte will be busy swimming approximately eight hours a day , scientists on accompanying boats will take water quality probes and conduct further experiments focused on plastic pollution in the pacific ocean
a new u.n. study , which was also published tuesday for world environment day , suggests that plastic pollution is an increasingly serious concern across the globe
write the authors , who warn that plastic pollution is already manifesting itself in ways that few people are aware of
hundreds of animal species are being harmed by the toxic chemicals that are often used to produce plastics and may enter the human food chain
last week , for instance , a whale died in southern thailand after eating plastic rubbish and vomiting out several plastic bags
overall , the u.n. estimates the global damage to marine ecosystems amounts to at least $ 13 billion annually
national responses have varied with the united states still lagging behind , despite sharing a significant responsibility for the problem
north america produced 21 percent of the worlds single-use plastics in 2014 and was outranked only by northeast asia , where 26 percent of the worlds plastic supplies were made
wrote erik solheim , head of the u.n
most plastic packaging waste comes from china , but the united states is the worlds biggest per capita polluter , followed by japan and the european union
in the study , the u.n. authors provide the first comprehensive analysis of policies in place worldwide to counter plastic pollution
overall , they document efforts across 50 countries , mostly focusing on africa and europe
whereas african nations appear to prefer total or partial bans over economic instruments , such as artificially raising prices on plastic bags , european lawmakers have mostly relied on the latter
notably absent from that statistic is north america , where national legislation to decrease plastic waste does not exist
that doesnt mean that americans simply dont care about the problem , though
in fact , there are more u.s. cities or states that have banned plastic bags and put restrictions on the use of the plastic foam material in takeout coffee cups than in europe , africa and south america combined
wrote solheim , the u.n
environment program chief
while many african nations were so directly affected by the impact of plastic pollution that they decided to take action , the impact of u.s. toothpaste on marine life in the pacific ocean appears harder to grasp for many americans or europeans
over the next six months , lecomte , the french swimmer , wants to show people that theres a link between their morning routines or their takeout coffee and the plastic smog polluting millions of square miles of the worlds oceans
his decision to risk the grueling adventure was partially motivated by a similarly eye-opening experience , he said in interviews before his departure
now , everywhere i go , on the beach , i see plastic everywhere.
