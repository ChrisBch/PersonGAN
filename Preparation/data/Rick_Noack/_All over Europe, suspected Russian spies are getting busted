berlin when two men suspected of poisoning former russian spy sergei skripal appeared on russian television earlier this month , the bizarre interview set the stage for another round of western-russian accusations
viewers around the world subsequently mocked the pair , who had quickly become the worlds most famous suspected russian spying duo
their appearance came against a backdrop of what seems to be a string of defeats in europe for russias military spy agency , the gru , and mass expulsions of russian diplomats and spies earlier this year shortly after the skripal poisoning
on friday , in the latest incident , norwegian authorities arrested a 51-year-old russian man on suspicion that he unlawfully gathered information during an inter-parliamentary seminar on digitization this month in norway
after the detention was made public by authorities sunday , the russian embassy in norway rejected the accusation as absurd
earlier this month , estonia arrested a military officer and his father both russian-estonian citizens and accused the two of having spied for russia for more than half a decade
about 300,000 of estonias 1.3 million citizens belong to the countrys russian-speaking minority , and officials have struggled to bridge the divide between the two groups ever since estonia gained independence from the soviet union in 1991
amid its proximity to russia and its complicated history , tiny estonia has charged at least 12 alleged spies over the last 10 years
but estonian officials say the high detention numbers are also due to the less than hush-hush approach to dealings with accused spies
whereas some other countries have hesitated to make cases public , estonia says it has chosen a path of transparency , according to a government statement provided to the moscow times
recent public accusations in norway and several other european countries may similarly indicate a more confrontational approach to counterespionage as well
swiss officials confirmed two weeks ago that dutch authorities had arrested and expelled a pair of suspected russian spies earlier in the year over accusations that they had been trying to hack a swiss laboratory
the targeted bern-based spiez lab is associated with the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons , which was involved in the investigation into the poisoning of skripal and his daughter with a banned nerve agent
the alleged hacking attempt prompted switzerland to summon the russian ambassador , although moscow denied any involvement
using similar language to that employed after last fridays arrest in norway , the russian embassy in switzerland subsequently called the allegations absurd.
in any case , the subsequent investigation appears to have provided european agencies with a number of details
other individuals with passports sharing similar features allegedly had ties to a coup attempt in the country of montenegro as well as other , prior expulsions , according to the two media outlets
all this at the very least suggests that russias spies in europe , at least those with the gru military agency , might be well advised to look for new passports
