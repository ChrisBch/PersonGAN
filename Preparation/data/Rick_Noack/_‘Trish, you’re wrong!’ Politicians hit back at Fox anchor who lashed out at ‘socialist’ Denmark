theres the denmark of lego , the little mermaid and intelligent tv shows that weve all heard so much about
then theres the other denmark
the one found on the fox business network
everyone in denmark is working for the government , anchor trish regan announced in a segment aired last week
and no one wants to work
not only is school free they actually pay you
... you know what happens then
nobody graduates from school
they just stay in school , regan went on to say , referring to university-level education
because thats the reality of socialism
as one person who studied denmark said nowadays all the kids graduating from schools in denmark , they want to start cupcake cafes , regan said before breaking into laughter
denmark like venezuela has stripped people of their opportunities , the anchor concluded on a more serious note
regan clarified her remarks on tuesday , saying on her show i was never implying that conditions in denmark were similar in any way to the current tragedy on the ground there in venezuela
i was merely pointing out , using reports from the atlantic , the independent and other publications , that socialism is not the way
before her clarification , a top danish official had voiced puzzlement about her remarks
we are working much more than americans and at the same time ranking as the worlds best in work-life-balance sic , danish finance minister kristian jensen wrote monday on twitter
addressing the fox business network anchor directly , he added you should come to denmark if you dare be confronted with facts
so danes dont wants to work
11 places better than us in oecd statistics
we are working much more than americans and at the same time ranking as the worlds best in work-life-balance
you should come to denmark if you dare be confronted with facts trish_regan
denmarks social democrats published a video in which former government minister dan jorgensen summarizes the countrys feelings about the segment trish , youre wrong
something is rotten at fox news
regans initial characterization of denmark as a bleak nation that robs its citizens doesnt really add up , as any visitor to the country has probably noticed
employment rates in denmark are higher than in the united states
curiously , the no one wants to work danish employees are also more productive than their u.s. counterparts
regan was correct in saying that denmark pays its citizens to study rather than charging tuition
but the country still has some of europes lowest university dropout rates and performs better than nations charging their students
any direct comparison between european and u.s. university degrees is somewhat flawed , but to suggest the u.s. system is successful at retaining students would be flat-out wrong
less than 60 percent of undergraduate students in the united states finished their studies within six years , according to data from the national center for education statistics
meanwhile , a cross-european survey conducted roughly at the same time found that 79 percent of danish undergraduate students completed their courses
( among those students are an increasing number of u.s. citizens who cant afford college in their home country )
the numbers suggest paying students to study actually encourages children of lower-income families to graduate from college , which has decreased inequality in denmark
once young danes have completed their courses , they can rely on universal access to health care and can move to copenhagen currently the worlds ninth most-livable city
( no u.s. city made it into the top 10 this year )
despite all the hardship they apparently experience in their socialist dystopia , the danes have retained their sense of humor
after last weeks fox report , denmarks ambassador to the united states , lars gert lose , prepared a handy guide for anyone interested in finding out more about living in the scandinavian socialist state
inviting regan to denmark , lose kindly offered to assist , before warning that the lack of cupcake cafs probl sic will be disappointing
we did some quick research on denmarks global rankings useful context to your story abt state of affairs in my country
go see for yourself ( we would love to assist ) although lack of cupcake cafs probl will be disappointing
this post has been updated to include a clarification by fox business network host trish regan
