turkish president recep tayyip erdogan addressed parliament on tuesday to accuse saudi arabia of the planned and brutal killing of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi
his remarks were closely watched in washington , where president trump has at times backed the saudi investigation and at other times voiced doubts about it
the saudis acknowledged khashoggis death in their istanbul consulate only last week , after long denying any knowledge of his whereabouts
in his speech , he asked saudi arabia to extradite the 18 suspects saudi arabia says it has identified as being responsible for the killing
but while accusing the saudis of covering up a premeditated hit job , erdogan also raised doubts tuesday about the concept of diplomatic immunity
its an agreement that has in the past protected perpetrators of crimes , but that also has prevented illegal interference in diplomatic work
the law that explains why turkey was hamstrung in searching for khashoggi
erdogan should be well aware of that , given that his own bodyguards escaped prosecution not long ago , relying on the same international legal framework
in may , protesters and security guards who accompanied erdogan during a trip to washington clashed outside the turkish ambassadors residence
after the demonstration attended by anti-erdogan and pro-kurdish activists turned violent , 11 people , including a police officer , had to be treated for injuries
at least two people were arrested
when footage emerged showing the extent to which the turkish protective detail had been responsible for the escalation , d.c. police identified a number of presidential bodyguards and eventually issued arrest warrants , even as questions mounted about the diplomatic status of erdogans security team
footage showed the bodyguards kicking and choking people
but the vienna conventions on diplomatic and consular relations from the early 1960s similarly clearly lay out the limits of prosecutors in international diplomacy
police and security officials are not allowed to enter an embassy or consulate without previously being granted permission to do so by the nation occupying it
certain bags or letters sent from consulates or embassies also may not be opened by authorities of host nations
and , most important in last years case , immunity also applies to embassy staff members and some other visiting foreign officials
the clashes last year and khashoggis killing on oct. 2 are somewhat different , given that the saudis have not argued that the 15 people who traveled to istanbul acted as diplomats or under diplomatic protection
in this case , turkeys focus has been on entering space located on its soil but still inaccessible to its authorities
although the cases differ , the measures nations have at their disposal to hold foreign diplomatic workers accountable are the same
governments can ask nations to waive the immunity of their staff members
if those efforts fail , they can unilaterally revoke consular clearances or declare ambassadors persona non grata , which effectively requires them to leave
its unclear whether turkish authorities have evidence against any consular employees still in istanbul
citing turkish media outlets , the reuters news agency reported last week that the saudi consul had left the city before turkish investigators searched the consulate
university of virginia associate law professor ashley deeks wrote last year
after last years clashes in washington , it was not immediately clear whether erdogans bodyguards were protected by diplomatic immunity
although administrative and technical embassy staff members are exempt from prosecutions unless that protection is waived by their nations , some visiting officials do not automatically receive immunity
for lower-level officials a category that would apply to bodyguards a number of factors determine whether diplomatic immunity applies to them secret service agents traveling abroad with u.s. presidents have at times encountered similar challenges
as officials were debating which rules would apply in last years case outside the turkish ambassadors residence , some were already demanding a prosecution regardless of the outcome
his remarks came as the turkish bodyguards were still in the united states and could theoretically have been prevented from leaving the country
but two guards who were briefly detained after the clashes were released within hours
fifteen guards were indicted the following month , but by that time they had left u.s. soil
u.s. prosecutors have since dropped assault and conspiracy charges against 11 of them
erdogan denounced the charges , but tuesdays remarks indicate that his support for international law appears to fluctuate , depending on the circumstances
correction an earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that erdogan 's bodyguards escaped prosecution under the same specific convention protecting the saudi consulate in the khashoggi case
