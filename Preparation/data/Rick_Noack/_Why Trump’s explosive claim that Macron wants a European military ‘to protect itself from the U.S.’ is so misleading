paris for the second time , president trump has repeated the false claim that french president emmanuel macron called for a european army to protect the continent against the united states
macron never said any such thing
the remark came on a particularly solemn day in france , the three-year anniversary of the nov. 13 paris attacks , in which 130 people were killed in a coordinated assault by terrorists affiliated with the islamic state
it was the bloodiest attack on french soil since world war ii
tuesdays comment echoed trumps earlier statement , which he made as air force one was arriving in france on friday evening
trump wrote on twitter
president macron of france has just suggested that europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the u.s. , china and russia
very insulting , but perhaps europe should first pay its fair share of nato , which the u.s. subsidizes greatly
trumps interpretation of macrons remarks is factually misleading and comes from an interview macron gave to frances europe 1 radio several days before trumps arrival
what macron said has been largely echoed by european union leaders for months now and in fact mimics the same demand trump has long made europe needs to stop relying on the united states for its own defense
macron told europe 1
macrons demands for a european army were met with skepticism across europe this week , but not for the same reasons to which trump objected
though some e.u
members have multinational brigades or share equipment to save costs , european national constitutions fundamentally differ on the circumstances of military operations
germanys post-world war ii constitution , for instance , has restricted military operations far more than is the case in contemporary britain or france , countries that have participated in u.s. strikes against syrias assad regime after a chemical weapons attack this year
german forces , however , would have been unable to intervene for constitutional reasons
while demands for a european army are unlikely to move ahead anytime soon given those challenges , macrons broader point that europe needs to become less dependent on the united states is not new
last summer , german chancellor angela merkel similarly said europe really must take our fate into our own hands , even though she was not explicitly discussing military issues
germany , for instance , hosts some of the biggest u.s. military bases outside the united states and has no intention of forcing them out
like merkel , macron has repeatedly emphasized europes willingness to cooperate with the united states under trump , even as those ties are under mounting pressure
rushing to trumps defense on social media , some pointed to another macron quote in the same interview this week
europe has to protect itself with respect to china , russia and even the united states , he said
but in that portion of his radio interview , macron was actually referring to cybersecurity matters and fading multilateralism
trump essentially combined two parts of the same interview , which was initially mistranslated in some english-language reports
there has been some scrutiny of u.s. cybersecurity operations in europe for years , especially after it was revealed in 2014 that the national security agency intercepted calls by merkel and had access to sensitive communications
from a european perspective , not protecting itself from possible u.s. spying operations would appear rather naive , given those disclosures
in any case , this has been a difficult week for macron in comments made to journalists
the ambiguities of his statements have dominated the headlines
following outrage from jewish groups and public commentators , the elysee palace was forced on the defensive , insisting there would be no formal commemoration of ptain
with his remarks on u.s.-european ties this week , however , macron is far from being the only leader in europe who has blamed the united states for some of the fading multilateralism in recent years
trump has threatened the e.u
with tariffs , withdrawn from an iran deal europe says it will uphold and repeatedly raised questions over the future of nato pledges that have drawn the ire of capitals across the continent
macrons comments reflected that divide , but theres no reason the united states should be worried about a looming european invasion
