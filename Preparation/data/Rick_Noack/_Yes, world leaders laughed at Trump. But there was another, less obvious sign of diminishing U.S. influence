berlin for a president who has emphasized that the united states should not be laughed at , donald trumps u.n. general assembly speech tuesday must have been a serious blow
first , world leaders laughed at him when he boasted of what he described as his unprecedented accomplishments
then , top german diplomats smirked at his suggestion that they were totally dependent on russia well aware that investigators are probing just how dependent his own companions are on the kremlin
the laughter and smirks made for viral videos , but there was another , less noticed sign of diminishing u.s. influence that boiled up on the sidelines of the general assembly session
as trump emphasized u.s. sovereignty , the european union , russia and china announced plans to circumvent u.s. sanctions reimposed on iran by trump in may
the may move to withdraw from the obama-era iran nuclear deal was supposed to force europe to follow suit and to pressure iran into renegotiating the deal
neither has happened , so far
instead , u.s. pressure appears to be resulting in the emergence of an alternative payment system that could shield some non-u.s. companies from american sanctions and allow iran to export oil and other goods to corporations in the european union and elsewhere
the latest announcement came after the e.u
passed an updated blocking statute last month with the same goal
that earlier effort required european companies to seek compensation from the u.s. treasury department , however , with an uncertain outcome
the e.u.s high representative for foreign affairs , federica mogherini , said tuesday
given the untested nature of the e.u
's current efforts , there are reasons to remain skeptical about whether those plans will be able to reassure international companies to stay in iran
to some , the risk of being hit by u.s. sanctions may still outweigh the benefits of exploring a new market that was restricted until only recently
on wednesday , germanys industry and trade association dihk said that german exports to iran have decreased by 18 percent since trump announced he would reimpose sanctions on the country
german carmaker volkswagen announced last week that it was withdrawing from iran , giving in to u.s. pressure
overall , german companies exported goods worth $ 3.4 billion to iran last year
but germany exported goods worth $ 117 billion to the united states in 2017 , indicating that most companies were still far more dependent on trade with the united states than with exploring opportunities in iran
in the short run , only small or medium-size european companies that rely more on their trade with iran than with the united states are expected to participate in the e.u
in the long run , however , the e.u
effort could dismantle u.s. dominance of international payment systems a status that has handed u.s. leaders a powerful tool of both economic and political influence in the past , for instance by stopping chinese exports to north korea and other rogue states
trump officials naturally were not amused by the e.u
announcement this week , backed by france , britain , germany , russia and china
u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo said , this is one of the most counterproductive measures imaginable for regional and global peace and security
pompeo said that he was disturbed and indeed deeply disappointed.
but european governments have rejected u.s. criticism , saying that even though there might be flaws , the current deal is better than no deal
so far , its still unclear how the e.u
's alternative payment system would work , but one of the likeliest options involves a credits system that would allow companies with iran ties to trade goods without transferring real money
that system would make it almost impossible for u.s. authorities to track trade between european and iranian companies and minimize the risk of sanctions
both on stage and behind the scenes , tuesdays u.n. general assembly session proved how isolated the trump administration has become after escalating tensions with foes and triggering new spats with allies
