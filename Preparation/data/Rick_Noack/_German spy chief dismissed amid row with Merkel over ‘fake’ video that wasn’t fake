berlin germanys domestic intelligence chief , hans-georg maassen , was removed from his office tuesday evening amid a fallout with german chancellor angela merkel that at times appeared to threaten her political future
maassens dismissal serves as yet another example of merkels ability to fend off challengers
but the case also revealed just how vocal opponents of the german leader , who is in her 13th year in office , have become and how much her immigration policies have polarized the country
this summer , interior minister horst seehofer almost toppled merkels coalition when he openly opposed her immigration policies , which have long been more welcoming than those of her european counterparts
the latest turmoil was the result of an interview maassen gave to germanys most widely read tabloid , bild , two weeks ago , after demonstrations and mob attacks on immigrants by far-right and extremist groups in the east german town of chemnitz
in the interview , merkels spy chief questioned the authenticity of an online video of the incident and contradicted merkel , who had previously condemned the attacks , relying on that footage and other reports
without giving any basis for questioning them
prosecutors leading the investigation into the far-right demonstration in chemnitz said theres no evidence the video is fake
maassens statements caused an uproar among german politicians and journalists , some of whom accused him of playing into a far-right narrative of fake news that helped fuel the chemnitz demonstrations in the first place
after a german man was killed following a brawl with migrants , far-right groups began demonstrating in chemnitz on aug. 26
at one point , about 6,000 people took to the streets , with some openly giving the hitler salute and assaulting immigrants
after the spy chief had indirectly and apparently falsely contradicted the chancellor , many expected him to be fired within days
for more than five years , maassen had been in charge of a domestic spy agency accused of a number of far-right scandals in recent years , including its failure to stop the far-right nsu terrorist group from killing 10 people between 2000 and 2007
after the groups alleged crimes were revealed , a review of thousands of cases brought to light that 849 more people than originally thought may have been killed by right-wing extremists since 1990
but firing maassen without the approval of seehofer , the spy chiefs only major supporter , was considered almost impossible until tuesday , given seehofers key role in the christian social union , which is part of merkels coalition government
it is unclear what triggered seehofers change of heart regarding maassen , but the face-saving solution might have been maassens new job as a permanent secretary in seehofers interior ministry
as such , maassen will remain a top-level security official a deal that will allow seehofer and other supporters to portray maassens dismissal tuesday as a de facto promotion to a more-senior-level job
at the same time , merkel was facing pressure from her other coalition partner , the social democrats ( spd ) , who repeatedly called for maassen to step down
this week , spd leader andrea nahles stated that mr. maassen must go , and i tell you , he will go , not only citing his statements about the chemnitz video but also calling into question his ability to fight right-wing extremism
maassens critics argue that he had become a hero of the far right in germany
at recent protests , maassen , who was supposed to be germanys top anti-extremism official , was applauded by the far right for what it views as support for its agenda
but for other , more-moderate right-wing voters , support for maassen appeared to be driven more by a dislike for merkel than by enthusiasm for him
before his dismissal tuesday , some german media commentators called the debate over maassens future a stand-in for much larger questions about where the country stands and where its heading
