as more than 40 african heads of state arrived at the china-africa cooperation summit monday , one figure stood out $ 60 billion
that 's how much additional funding chinese president xi jinping promised the continent as the two-day summit got underway
and all of africa is competing for it except for one country swaziland , an absolute monarchy that has in recent months renamed itself eswatini
the tiny kingdom was absent from this week 's africa summit and appears to have no plans of attending anytime soon
it 's the last african nation that still recognizes taiwan as an independent country , much to the dismay of the chinese leadership in beijing , which considers taiwan to be a wayward province
the kingdom is now the only remaining african ally of taiwan and belongs to an increasingly small pool of supporters worldwide , as china has stepped up international pressure to switch allegiances
when dealing with china and taiwan , foreign countries have to choose between the two , as beijing is refusing to establish diplomatic ties with nations that recognize taiwan 's independence
in many cases , china has tied those investments to political commitments
beijing denies using financial aid to persuade nations to cut ties with taiwan , but the dominican republic said in may that it switched allegiances to accept $ 3.1 billion in loans from china
burkina faso followed only days later
and after el salvador severed ties to taiwan in august , taipei said the central american country had previously asked for an astronomical sum in aid
more recently , major u.s. airlines bowed to chinese demands to list taiwan as part of china , amid the possibility of chinese state-sanctioned boycotts
so , why is the kingdom of swaziland taiwans last holdout in africa
life expectancy in the kingdom has declined by 12 years over the past two decades
to escape , some swaziland residents have fled to neighboring south africa , where they work in mines , of which a growing number are funded by the chinese
taiwan may regularly accuse china of using money to purchase loyalty , but to preserve the few international friends it still has , it has similarly invested into local infrastructure projects or established scholarships in swaziland
mswati has returned the favor by visiting taiwan 17 times so far
the swaziland leader is now able to reach taipei on a nonstop flight , after he expanded his collection of expensive luxury toys by purchasing a new airbus a340-400 from taiwan this summer
in swaziland , taiwan may have found a loyal supporter at least as long as it 's willing to back a leader with a long list of enemies and no interest in flying nonstop to beijing
