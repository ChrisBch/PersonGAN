berlin the european union 's chief executive pushed ahead friday with plans to abandon daylight saving time , saying on german television that millions ... believe that summertime should be all the time
jean-claude juncker is expected to discuss the topic with e.u
commissioners , who could vote to recommend the change
so far , the bloc 's member states put their clocks forward by an hour every spring and switch them back in late october , in a tradition that is similar to the u.s. model , even though dates vary
while many europeans rejoiced on social media upon hearing the news friday , there is more than one catch
any abandonment of daylight saving time would still need to be approved by the european parliament and the e.u
's 28 member states
and while the e.u
is trying to frame the proposal as a success for citizen participation , it is based on shaky ground an unrepresentative online poll that was at times not even accessible
the largest share of participants came from one country germany where the time switch has been a somewhat odd front-page topic for years
but any e.u
decision would also impact the 27 other member states
despite questions over the e.u
's use of online polls to guide decisions , the bloc 's push for daylight saving time might still be welcomed in a vast number of european capitals
dozens of other countries , including russia and belarus , have long abandoned the practice
nations have been increasingly vocal about what some perceive as a waste of resources with little benefit in recent years
in poland , there was rare cross-party agreement last year when legislators pursued efforts to end summer time
said lawmaker bronislaw karasek , who worked on the bill for the center-left polish peoples party
the country is technically not allowed to implement such changes alone because it is bound by e.u
rules , but the polish initiative was still welcomed by other member states that similarly oppose sticking with daylight saving time
finland led more recent efforts to bring the topic back onto the agenda this year
the status quo has faced mounting criticism as researchers have pointed out health and economic burdens
researchers say the step would make sense , as the twice-annual time switch can result in health issues among elderly people and children
russian scientists , for example , found that the risk of heart attacks increased by 50 percent and that the suicide rate grew even more when clocks were changed
otherwise healthy adults have complained about sleeplessness or difficulties in focusing at work during the days following the changing of the clocks
the biggest challenge with abandoning the practice will be to agree on whether europe should be on permanent summer or winter time in the future
time zones often stretch across continents without a clear pattern looking at a map , one would assume that britain , france and spain are in the same zone , for example , but they are n't
hence , for some e.u
nations , it would make more sense to abandon summer time
for others , sticking with winter time even during the summer would be more advantageous to save energy
daylight saving time was introduced during world wars i and ii to save energy costs , both in the united states and in europe , although its modern-day effect on energy consumption is disputed
it was standardized across western europe in the early 1980s and has since been in place more or less without modifications
although more than 70 countries use some form of daylight saving time today , the practice is still most popular in europe and the united states as other countries either never joined or have since abandoned it
decision to end daylight saving time would reduce the number of nations using it by more than a third
