cologne , germany judging from some of the headlines the far-right alternative for germany ( afd ) party has prompted , one wouldnt assume that its also seeking to be an alternative for germanys jewish voters
last year , leading afd figure bjrn hcke called berlins holocaust memorial a memorial of disgrace and urged germans to stop feeling guilty for nazi crimes
then theres afd politician martin hohmann , who just celebrated his return to parliament after more than a decades absence following his expulsion from the mainstream conservative christian democratic union party over anti-semitic remarks
yet , on oct. 7 , the afd is expected to launch its first jewish association , in a move that has triggered a fierce backlash among other jewish organizations
the announcement comes as the afds popularity across the country is growing , with polls showing it ahead of the center-left social democrats as the countrys second-most-popular party
the controversial launch of the afds jewish association also comes after months of anti-semitic incidents that have rattled german jewish communities
even though top afd officials have publicly condemned the incidents , jewish organizations have accused the far-right party of playing into the hands of anti-semites
other jewish representatives have publicly wondered whether the afd may be positioning itself as being in support of jewish communities to justify its extreme positions against muslim migrants
the party does not release statistics on its members religious beliefs , but far-right efforts to woo jewish voters are neither unprecedented nor limited to germany
in france , the netherlands and hungary , far-right parties or politicians have similarly tried to capitalize on the influx of muslim refugees to woo jewish voters
in fact , there are apparently a fair number of jewish supporters of the afd in germany
many jewish communities in postwar germany were formed by russian immigrants who stayed behind after the soviet union was dismantled
today , germans with russian origins are some of the afds most loyal voters , jewish afd member of parliament wolfgang fuhl said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk
his party has boasted that a significant number of its supporters are jewish
even though such claims have not been backed up with data , fuhl is far from being the only jewish politician who has run for office with the support of the afd
in the federal state of baden-wrttemberg , four of the afds 38 parliamentary candidates last year were jewish , and the party hopes to grow its jewish base further , despite fierce backlash from some jewish groups
ahead of the september 2017 general election , in which the afd made significant gains , the world jewish congress accused the afd of being a disgrace for germany.
charlotte knobloch , a former president of the central council of jews in germany , said last year
petry was referring to muslim migrants even though official statistics show that the vast majority of anti-semitic attacks in germany are committed by right-wing extremists
according to a report released by german authorities in august , the number of anti-semitic attacks a category that includes violent or verbal attacks has surged by more than 10 percent year-over-year , with one-fifth occurring in berlin
while some of the increases may be attributed to changed reporting mechanisms , authorities view the numbers as a cause for concern
jewish organizations in germany broadly agree that the government should do more to protect jewish communities against attacks from newcomers , but they have also consistently warned against persistent threats from the far right
critics fear that the afd has become more radical in recent months after the more moderate petry was toppled by the partys more hard-line base last year
germanys domestic spy agency recently said extremism had become so widespread in two of the partys youth wings that it decided to monitor the groups
amid the afds surge in popularity , especially among younger voters , jewish organizations warned about a novel target in its outreach campaigns jewish retirement homes
dont be fooled by the afds anti-muslim , inflammatory rhetoric , the central council of jews in germany subsequently cautioned in a letter to its members
