berlin canadian prime minister justin trudeau may have expected a lot to happen during the group of seven summit last weekend , but being assigned to an afterlife in both hell and heaven probably wasnt on the list
white house trade adviser peter navarro said on fox news sunday
trade adviser peter navarro theres a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with pres
donald j. trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out ... thats what bad faith justin trudeau did
the european union responded swiftly to the attack on sunday evening , with european council president donald tusk tweeting trudeau deserved a special place in heaven for organizing the g-7 summit
there is a special place in heaven for justintrudeau
canada , thank you for the perfect organisation of g7
what caused the rift
as trump had already left the g-7 summit and was on his way to singapore for his coming meeting with north korean leader kim jong un , trudeau held a news conference in which he went to great lengths to avoid offending trump
but the canadian prime minister still said a few things that didnt go down well inside air force one
embedded in more polite remarks , trudeau reiterated his objections to trumps imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum from canada , mexico and the european union and his own plans to introduce retaliatory measures targeting u.s. products
trudeau said , triggering a dispute that revolves around three key issues
in the two tweets that ended u.s. support for the joint g-7 statement , trump accused trudeau of having made false statements during a prior news conference
pm justin trudeau of canada acted so meek and mild during our g7 meetings only to give a news conference after i left saying that , us tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around.
very dishonest & weak
our tariffs are in response to his of 270 % on dairy
the president did not specify which exact remarks he considered to be false
representatives from other g-7 countries said they felt as though they had made progress in conveying their positions to trump , something many of them felt pressured to do by voters at home
despite the tension , the member states leaders were cordial in person , trump included
he made first-name references to angela and justin , and he repeatedly insisted he blamed previous u.s. leaders , not foreign ones , for what he sees as the global trade imbalance
based on that account , trudeau wasnt the only g-7 leader who toned down the rhetoric in direct talks
fair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal
according to a canada release , they make almost 100 billion dollars in trade with u.s. ( guess they were bragging and got caught )
minimum is 17b
tax dairy from us at 270 %
then justin acts hurt when called out
trump has repeatedly complained about canadian tariffs on imported dairy products , and hell or heaven aside , the truth is that neither the united states nor europe or canada are exactly angels when it comes to their trade policies
its true canadian farmers benefit from high tariffs on imported dairy , while many u.s. farmers are facing an existential crisis
because of canadas protectionist dairy industry , canadian farmers earn much more per liter of milk
canada argues it still allows a higher ratio of sold milk to be imported from abroad than the united states does and there is not necessarily a causal relationship between the crisis of the u.s. industry and canadian tariffs
at the moment , the european union targets u.s.-built cars with a 10-percent tariff , while the united states distinguishes between vans or pickup trucks and other cars
the former are targeted with a 25 percent tariff , while a 2.5 percent tariff applies on other vehicles
european carmakers argue they employ tens of thousands of american workers across the united states and any tariffs would result in u.s. layoffs
in tweets and public remarks , trump has said he believes europe and canada are engaging in unfair trade practices that put the united states at a disadvantage
but to justify his steep tariffs imposed on canada , mexico and the european union , trump has relied on an obscure provision that allows member states of the world trade organization to claim exemptions from its obligations if national security is at stake
indeed , 90 percent of primary aluminum that u.s. companies rely on to make products , including fighter jets , is imported from abroad , which has served as an argument to those keen to defend trumps desire to revive the american aluminum industry
that argument , however , has rarely been used by wto member states , partially because proving the exception applies is usually difficult and virtually impossible in trumps case
