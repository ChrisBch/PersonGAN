ever since malaysia airlines flight 370 disappeared without a trace on march 8 , 2014 , theories about its disappearance have drawn global attention
they may very well remain theories forever
the four-year hunt for flight 370 is coming to an end as private texas-based contractor ocean infinitys search vessel , equipped with underwater sonar drones , is expected to head back from the indian ocean amid rising costs and deteriorating weather
no precise date was provided by the search firm , but malaysias new government hinted last week that the efforts would soon draw to a close
oliver plunkett , the chief executive of ocean infinity , said in a statement
it was the latest of many such efforts to find the plane , but this time there are no plans for more missions
australia , china and malaysia teamed up for a joint search for flight 370 until last year , but stopped their efforts , saying the hunt would start again only if clues pointed to a new , specific location
malaysia signed a contract with ocean infinity in january , promising the company $ 70 million in case it managed to find the wreckage
under the agreement , the company agreed to work free if it did not locate it
despite mounting costs , the search was extended twice in recent months and covered a seabed area equivalent to 43,000 square miles
flight 370 disappeared on its way from kuala lumpur to beijing with 239 people on board
new questions about the planes disappearance were raised two weeks ago , when a team of analysts assembled by an australian tv channel said the 53-year-0ld pilot may have committed suicide killing 238 people with him
according to that theory , the pilot may have depressurized the plane , knocking out anyone without an oxygen mask and explaining the mysterious silence as the plane disappeared from radar or why the wreckage wasnt found along its projected flight path
investigators have disputed that possibility , reemphasizing that they think everybody on the plane including the pilot fell unconscious
the uncontrolled aircraft later ran out of fuel , investigators think , and crashed into the sea
only the wreckage itself could help to determine what really happened to flight 370 , but the chances of that happening further diminished with tuesdays announcement
