the reality , however , is much different
after canadas foreign minister expressed alarm at the recent arrest of a saudi womens rights activist , the kingdom on monday expelled the canadian ambassador , halted trade and investment deals , and ordered up to 12,000 of its students to return to the kingdom
flights will be suspended starting next week
the measures were part of a seemingly unprecedented diplomatic storm that appeared to have come without warning , given that canada is hardly the first western democracy to criticize the monarchys human-rights record
but a closer look at saudi arabias responses to foreign criticism under its new crown prince , mohammed bin salman , tells a slightly different story that saudi fury didnt come entirely out of nowhere
said fawaz gerges , professor of middle eastern politics at the london school of economics
a number of european nations have felt the fallout of saudi arabias new assertiveness in recent years
in 2015 , the kingdom temporarily recalled its ambassador to sweden after the scandinavian nation singled out saudi writer raif badawis arrest and trial as an example of broader human rights failures in the middle eastern monarchy
( the activist at the center of the current saudi-canadian dispute is his sister , samar badawi , whose arrest was made public last week )
and germany has also felt the tougher approach mohammed appears to have embraced
in november , its foreign minister , sigmar gabriel , said that europe could not tolerate the adventurism that has spread there.
saudi arabia first lashed out at gabriel over what it said were shameful and unjustified remarks , and then recalled its ambassador , in the same pattern that played out in sweden with a twist
this spring , german officials confirmed to multiple media outlets that saudi arabia had also quietly blacklisted some german companies as a result of the criticism in a rare case of economic retaliation
to revive his countrys weakening economy , the crown prince who assumed power last year has worked up plans to create a new , futuristic city in the west of saudi arabia that he hopes will attract tech companies
to succeed , mohammed will need to balance the interests of ultraconservatives in his kingdom and of liberals demanding more extensive changes
said gerges , the middle east scholar
with the end of the obama administration , one of saudi arabias toughest critics disappeared putting other western powers like germany , france or canada in a more awkward position
referring to the saudi reforms
the most cutting official french criticism of saudi arabias human rights record during the crown princes visit was a rather oblique one a tweet from macron showed him with the crown prince discussing french painter eugene delacroixs painting liberty leading the people.
the painting shows a woman with bare breasts and on the revolutionary barricades
there was no public complaint from saudi arabia over the tweet
