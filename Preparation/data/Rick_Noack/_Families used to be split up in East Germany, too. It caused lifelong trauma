berlin katrin behr was only 4 years old when her life was turned upside down forever
her mothers crime
she wanted to flee the repressive socialist country into u.s.-protected west germany
like tens of thousands of others , behr was later adopted by families considered more regime-compliant
it took almost three decades for her to be able to tell her story
she wrote in her autobiography
even today , almost 30 years after the end of socialist reign in germany , some daughters and sons still search for the mothers who were forced to leave them behind a quest that can end in tearful reunions or lifelong uncertainty
in many cases , the early family separations have manifested themselves in trauma not only for the grown children , but also their parents
while the socialist regime painstakingly tried to hide its practices for decades , ironically its now the soviet unions former archrival , the united states , that is facing criticism for a scheme some say could have the same devastating effect on thousands of children
he did not say , however , that his own government is responsible for implementing the policy
sessions said in april
the practice made renewed headlines in recent days after it was suggested that the department of health and human services had lost track of nearly 1,500 immigrant children placed with sponsors in the united states even though that characterization turned out to be incorrect
in a now-unified germany , forced adoptions have become synonymous with the state terrorism and injustice that was rampant in the formerly socialist east , known as the gdr
reached by phone wednesday and told about the u.s. controversy , behr , 50 , drew a direct comparison between her experience and the fate of children now being separated from their parents in the united states
said behr , who lives in berlin and is involved in research projects about childhood trauma caused by family separation during the gdr
children who were separated from their parents for political reasons are today 50 percent more likely to be affected by anxiety , a study by german psychologists published in 2012 indicates
one out of every two separated children they interviewed suffered from one or more psychological disorders
said stefan trobisch-ltge , the director of gegenwind , a nongovernmental organization that supports victims of the former socialist regimes crimes
similar schemes were in place elsewhere in europe and across the world , including in australia , canada and ireland
the united states also separated some native american families and allowed white parents to adopt the children
those practices were stopped almost half a century ago and the extent of the scheme back than was limited , making large-scale research on its longer-term effects difficult
but the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 subsequently paved the way for particularly unsparing investigations of the practices of a socialist regime that was in large part overthrown by its own people
some of those studies have been published , while others are still underway , said forced adoption victim behr
when behr finally met her mother again , she was 23
almost two decades had passed since her forced adoption , but the joy of reunion was soon overshadowed
that day i realized how much we had involuntarily grown apart , she said
that divide has persisted ever since
