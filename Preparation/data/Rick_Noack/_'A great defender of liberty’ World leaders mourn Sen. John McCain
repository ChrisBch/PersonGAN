berlin if anyone ever doubted john mccains global stature , the outpouring of condolences from across the world on sunday should convince them otherwise easily
to world leaders , the 81-year-old arizona republican who lost his year-long battle with brain cancer this weekend was a hero , an inspiration to millions and a man of great courage.
to democratically elected politicians across the globe , mccain embodied a u.s. role model they were able to rally behind without hesitation
but mccain wasnt afraid of confronting illiberal regimes be they u.s. allies or foes with facts and criticism , earning him respect in some quarters but tense relationships in others
calling mccain a friend , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu tweeted that the senators support for israel sprang from his belief in democracy and freedom.
in europe , some condolences also hinted at mccains role as a vocal critic of the trump administration
german foreign minister heiko maas said.
we will remember his voice.
former british prime minister david cameron bid farewell to a brave , principled and inspiring leader.
in their condolences , european politicians cited mccains support for stronger transatlantic ties , especially as president trump is raising questions about the future of u.s.-european economic and defense ties
after trumps inauguration , mccain had embarked on a trip to more than a dozen countries to reassure u.s. allies
the arizona republicans vocal criticism of the trump administrations more isolationist foreign policy approach echoed many of the concerns raised in capitals around the world
on social media , numerous pakistani commentators and political figures also expressed appreciation for mccains long-standing ties with their country
the two sides forged an alliance during the cold war and later in the war on terror , but relations have since chilled amid accusations that pakistan harbors extremist groups fighting against afghanistan
tweeted pakistani sen. mushahid hussain
in iraq , where mccain championed an american invasion that toppled saddam hussein but is widely considered the major catalyst for the expansion of al-qaeda and the birth of the islamic state , reaction to the senators death was muted
in northern iraq , on the other hand , officials with the autonomous kurdistan regional government mourned mccain , remembering him as a longtime advocate for their interests
the 2003 invasion formalized iraqi kurds control over their own territory
mccain also recently broke with the state department and the white house and most u.s. allies when he supported a kurdish vote for full independence from iraq last year
masoud barzani , who until recently had been the longtime president of the kurdish region and remains influential in kurdish politics , wrote on twitter.
may he rest in eternal peace.
there was also an outpouring of tributes and condolences from ukraine
mccain was one of ukraines strongest american supporters in its ongoing conflict with russia
mccains tough criticism of russia over the 2014 annexation of crimea made the senator a key western ally for kiev
he posted photos of mccains 2016 visit to troops in war-torn eastern ukraine
the senator spent new years eve with those soldiers , telling them , your struggle is our struggle.
he tweeted sunday
mccains 2011 prediction that syrian leader bashar al-assad , whom russia backs militarily , would not survive long has proved to be wrong , pushkov noted , adding that assads overthrow and death did not wait for mccain.
as with russia , mccain wasnt afraid to confront china during his trips to asia
last year , he accused beijing of acting like a bully in the region , referencing the countrys territorial claims in the south china sea
taiwanese president tsai ing-wen said sunday , according to taiwans official news agency , in a statement in which she hailed mccains commitment to pushing back against chinese influence in the region
u.s. partners across the region echoed those thoughts in their responses on sunday
said philippine foreign secretary alan peter cayetano
what cayetano didnt mention in his statement was that mccain was also a fierce critic of the philippine government over its human rights record
even as a politician unafraid of confronting u.s. allies with criticism , mccain appears to have earned their respect in the united states and beyond
