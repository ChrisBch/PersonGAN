berlin when former british foreign secretary boris johnson resigned from his position in july , some of his counterparts abroad were likely relieved
johnson was known for mockery and ridicule considered to be deeply inappropriate by his foreign counterparts
but as brexit is quickly approaching and a deal on the terms of departure is still lacking , the diplomatic sensitivity many hoped would return after johnsons resignation is still nowhere to be found
in the latest incident that could play out to britains disadvantage in mainland europe , johnsons successor , jeremy hunt , drew angry reactions on sunday when he compared the european union with the soviet union
britains self-appointed mr. brexit , former u.k
independence party chief nigel farage , soon chimed in to claim credit for the comparison
jeremy hunt is using my language , the eu is the new soviet union
despite its questionable historical accuracy , the soviet union-e.u
comparison is also frequently being used by far-right populists opposed to membership in the bloc
but the same comparison by a leading member of the british government certainly didnt go down too well in the european union member states that lost tens of thousands of people to soviet occupation
latvias ambassador to britain , baiba brae , argued in a response to hunts speech
former polish foreign minister radosaw sikorski wrote on twitter
take the example of latvia that was invaded by the soviets in 1940
one year later , on june 14 , 15,000 latvian citizens including more than 2,000 children were rounded up in overnight raids and deported to soviet prison camps
half of them never returned
in all the baltic states that were occupied by the soviets , soviet prisons are still deeply associated with torture , executions and inhumane mistreatment
survivors later recalled sleep deprivation , exposure to extreme heat and overcrowding
some prison cells built for half a dozen inmates housed up to 40 people
to european leaders , the latest remarks from hunt , a leading mainstream conservative , served as yet another metaphor for the disconnect between british politicians and their european counterparts that has permeated the brexit negotiations for more than one year now
when british prime minister theresa may addressed the european union and her own country in mid-september after her plan to leave the e.u
appeared to have fallen apart , she emphasized that she had treated the e.u
with nothing but respect.
in hindsight , mays reassurance might sound like a desperate plea to her own party and to e.u
council president donald tusk recently posted a photo of him handing a cake to may , complete with the caption a piece of cake , perhaps
sorry , no cherries.
