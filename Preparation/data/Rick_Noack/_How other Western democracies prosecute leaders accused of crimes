berlin once again , the word impeachment is making the rounds in washington after lawyer michael cohen claimed on tuesday that he had worked to silence two women in coordination with his client , then-presidential candidate donald trump
but chances of trump being indicted are slim , even if cohens claims are substantiated
several analyses by the department of justice have concluded that the criminal indictment of a sitting president would violate the constitution
that increases the pressure on congress to consider calls for impeachment , even though that option remains similarly unlikely as long as trumps fellow republicans dominate the house
there are legitimate reasons political leaders enjoy special protections from judicial scrutiny while in office , such as the prevention of politically motivated investigations
thats why a majority vote in the house of representatives and a two-thirds majority among senators are needed to complete the impeachment and subsequent trial
but would there be ways to adopt a less politicized approach
europes lessons may not be fully applicable , given the unique u.s. political system , but some western nations have indeed found ways to increase accountability without exposing their leaders to politicized trials
for one , several european nations treat their prime ministers , presidents or chancellors like normal members of parliament whose immunity can be withdrawn far more easily than within the u.s. impeachment framework
a number of countries also do not limit the crimes that can trigger impeachment proceedings to bribery , treason and other high crimes or misdemeanors , as is the case in the united states
unlike in the united states , impeachment doesnt effectively result in the indictment of a head of state instead , leaders maintain their immunity for the remainder of their initial five-year term even if parliament deems them to be guilty of crimes
german leaders are far more exposed to judicial scrutiny
the mostly ceremonial german presidents enjoy immunity as long as theyre in office , even though parliament can vote to withdraw that protection by a simple majority
the same applies to germanys political leader , the chancellor , who usually is protected only by their immunity as an mp
( german chancellors normally also run for parliament and arent directly voted into the top office )
rallying a simple majority to withdraw immunity is far less challenging in germany than in the united states , given that the countrys multiparty system that makes it easier for opposition parties to build coalitions to remove a politicians protections
any parliamentary vote to withdraw immunity from a chancellor would usually also be accompanied by a leadership challenge , likely resulting in both the loss of immunity and the loss of the chancellors office
at least one german federal state , brandenburg , has chosen a different approach prosecutors there can pursue charges against mps as long as parliament does not vote to prevent the proceedings rather than having to decide whether to allow an investigation
in countries that rely on the westminster system britain , new zealand , australia , canada and others the definition of immunity is much narrower
mps and leaders are protected from investigations into alleged crimes committed in office only , and those protections can be suspended if deemed necessary by parliament
there are no laws specifically preventing the prosecution of prime ministers , but a british court still ruled in 2016 that former prime minister tony blair could not be charged over alleged war crimes committed during the invasion of iraq in 2003
in their verdict , the judges argued that a trial would inevitably expose state secrets , which suggests that different kinds of accusations might have moved forward
at least theoretically , british lawmakers can also impeach a sitting leader or fellow parliamentarian , even though parliaments own research division has called that possibility obsolete.
the last time parliamentarians chose to go down that path was in 1806 , and no prime minister has ever been impeached
britains original concept of it effectively turned lawmakers into a jury , equipped with the power to investigate cases and determine appropriate sentences
today , parliament would likely topple a prime minister accused of crimes by triggering a vote of no confidence
in parts of europe where democracy was established more recently than in britain , practices differ to some extent
greeces parliament , for instance , must approve any prosecutions against sitting mps , including the prime minister
but elsewhere , leaders have worked to protect themselves from possible trials
in 2008 , former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi benefited from legislation that protected the countrys prime minister , president and the speakers of both parliamentary chambers from lawsuits
at the time , berlusconi was under investigation for corruption
the law was later overturned by the countrys constitutional court and the former prime minister was subsequently sentenced to multiple jail terms , but had all of them waived or reduced
to berlusconis critics , his success at avoiding harsher punishments may also serve as a warning about the flaws of the system
parliaments support for berlusconi appears to have interfered with his prosecution for years after the end of his term
