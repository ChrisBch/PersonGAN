it appears to be the time of historical references in world politics
on may 25 , it was trumps turn to make ominous historical references , according to reports by cnn and cbc
defending his decision to impose trade tariffs on canada on national security grounds , trump perhaps as a joke asked prime minister justin trudeau during a call
didnt you guys burn down the white house
to be clear no , they didnt
in fact , the burning of the white house may be the worst possible example to justify a trade dispute one of the reasons the white house burned was because of a trade dispute
trump was referring to the war of 1812 between the british and the americans that resulted in the burning of washington in 1814 , at a time when canada was still part of the british empire
to justify his steep tariffs imposed on canada , mexico and the european union , trump has relied on an obscure provision that allows member states of the world trade organization to claim exemptions from its obligations if national security is at stake
that argument has rarely been used by wto member states , partially because proving that the exception applies is usually difficult and virtually impossible in trumps case
besides that , trump is now stuck with his underlying suggestion that some of the united states closest allies including europe and canada may pose a risk to u.s. national security
trudeau has vehemently rejected this suggestion , reminding the president of the thousands of canadians who have fought and died alongside american comrades-in-arms in two world wars and more recent conflicts
canada is also part of the five eyes intelligence alliance with the united states and three other nations that exchange especially sensitive information
the 1812 reference may prove the bizarreness of the entire argument , but it also points to a more troubling , historical lesson
the problem with that war especially is that it proves exactly what trump probably didnt want to imply trade disputes can easily get out of control
back in 1812 , the roles of britain and the united states were largely reversed
the united states wanted free trade with europe , but britain was vehemently opposed to that
the u.s. slogan that emerged in summer 1812 a free trade and sailors rights largely explains two of the key reasons that led to the subsequent war , and thus the destruction of the white house in 1814
the foreign policy research institute explained in a chronology of the war
under that principle , british officers would board u.s. vessels and force ( often former ) british sailors to work for them instead , which resulted in the 1807 uss chesapeake incident in which three american sailors were killed and 16 wounded
another point of contention was britains support for native americans
at the same time , the united states was suffering under the economic repercussions of its declaration of independence in 1776
as part of the british empire , londons colonies had been able to trade freely with much of the british-ruled world sort of an archaic version of nafta or the european economic area
but after rebelling against the british , the united states was suddenly on its own , as it faced trade restrictions by both the british and the french who were fighting each other in the napoleonic wars at the time
both countries were at odds with the united states because its policy of neutrality conflicted with the two european nations attempts to essentially to starve each other into submission
the united states of 1812 and the european union of 2018 are of course hardly comparable , especially as the united states and most western european nations are now part of the same military alliance , nato
but both the united states of two centuries ago and todays european union face similar choices over whether to comply with efforts to restrict free trade or whether to resist a powerful nation
asked the fourth u.s. president , james madison , according to bloomberg
in the case of the united states , the subsequent embargo caused economic decline in the short run , even though its being credited with making the united states more self-reliant in the long term
if anything , the 1812 example proves the unpredictability of such tactics on both sides
even though the british accepted many u.s. demands in june 1812 , their concessions came too late
by the time the news reached the other side of the atlantic , the united states had already declared war against britain
this post has been updated to clarify under which circumstances wto member states can claim exemptions from their international trade obligations if national security is at stake
