berlin poland is one of the few european countries where president trump is still not only welcome but indeed sought after
when polish president andrzej duda visited the white house on tuesday , he repeatedly praised the president and even floated the idea of naming a possible future u.s. military base in his country fort trump
the polish government did everything it could to turn tuesdays visit into one of trumps more enjoyable moments
yet , somehow , trump managed to offend the poles so deeply that the fallout was all over polish news sites on wednesday morning
at the end of their meeting , the two leaders agreed to sign a strategic partnership pact to boost defense , energy , trade and security ties
but what could have been a peaceful moment for both presidents immediately took an awkward turn
while signing the document , trump sat comfortably in his chair while the polish leader was forced to stand next to him and awkwardly reach over the table to sign
polands duda still somehow managed to smile at the camera , as trump looked on with a stern face
the scene was captured on camera by the white house and was tweeted out shortly after much to the bewilderment of polish journalists , politicians and researchers
polish radio correspondent pawel zuchowski sarcastically commented on twitter
in an interview with polish news site gazeta.pl , international diplomacy scholar janusz sibora called the incident an offense.
the polish news site compared the meeting of the two allies with trumps ceremonial signing of an agreement with north korean leader kim jong un in june , when both leaders sat at the same table
today , it was my great honor to welcome prezydentpl andrzej duda of poland to the whitehouse
the tweet was accompanied by a photo showing duda standing next to trump and holding their joint agreement
szyderstwa i napad lewackich mediw oraz niektrych politykw i komentatorw , o znanych pogldach , pokazuj sukces wizyty waszyngtonie
gdyby tak nie byo to by j przemilczeli jako niewan
dzikuj za te wyrazy uznania
pawel zalewski of the opposition liberal-conservative party wrote on twitter
according to polish tabloid fakt , other politicians and former ministers described the picture as unbelievable and as a humiliation.
im ashamed , roman giertych , a former deputy prime minister , was quoted as saying by the paper
many commentaries did not exclusively blame the trump administration , however , but also their own government for refraining to raise objections to the white house
on facebook , an account associated with former centrist polish president and nobel peace prize winner lech walesa appeared to troll duda with a photo of walesa sitting with trump standing next to him
the photo appeared to have been taken during a prior meeting of the two , but it was unclear where or when it happened.
you find difference , read the caption
you find difference
the angry responses following dudas white house visit come as the polish government is seeking closer ties to the trump administration , despite opposition protests
after a number of controversial measures , poland has been increasingly at odds with the european union , of which it is a member state
after its critics accused poland of infringing upon judicial independence , the country was suspended from the european network of councils for the judiciary this week
sanction was the latest in a string of attempts to rein in what critics say are undemocratic changes in the country
for months , warsaw has tried to persuade the united states to set up a permanent u.s. military presence in poland , to bolster the countrys defense against russia
poland appears to be willing to spend a substantial amount in exchange
trump said tuesday
but to more-critical observers watching from warsaw , the photo that was released only a short time later spoke a very different language
this post was updated on sept. 21 to include a response by polish president duda
