when the suez canal was opened in egypt in 1869 , the impact on global trade was revolutionary
instead of having to sail around africa , ships could now go straight from the indian ocean to the mediterranean sea connecting europe with asia
still , the distances , even via the suez canal , remained enormous 13,000 miles separate east asia from europe
about 150 years later , the next human-made revolution could cut the distance almost by half
as climate change progresses , the ice around the arctic circle is thawing and opening up a much shorter and potentially economically viable shipping route to the north of russia
with a distance of 8,000 miles , container ships would arrive about two weeks faster
what has long been a russian dream is increasingly matched by commercial interest in western europe
a company spokeswoman told the associated press
the trial journey could mark the beginning of a new era in arctic commercial shipping between three regions asia , north america and europe whose exports account for almost 90 percent of world trade
in 2016 , copenhagen business school researchers concluded that the route could become easily accessible to container ships at some point within the next 25 years.
the six years with the lowest observed summer sea ice extent have all occurred within the last decade
new forecast models are continuously bringing forward expectations of ice-free summers in the arctic , creating a significant potential for previously impossible maritime activities , they wrote
but with russia and china pushing ahead , the arctic route could become a real alternative much more quickly than many initially assumed
temperatures in the arctic have reached up to 85 degrees fahrenheit ( 30 celsius ) during some recent summer days , and a prolonged heat wave would mean that container ships would no longer need expensive icebreakers to clear paths for them
so far , cargo vessels on the arctic route are also required to have a thicker hull than ordinary container ships , which has limited the amount of goods they can carry
in the future , the sea north to russia may become accessible to more ordinary and bigger ships , too
being able to reach europe within two weeks would make shipping roughly as fast as the railway route that is increasingly popular among asian and european companies because of its speed
cargo trains need about 14 days to go from eastern china to central europe
experts say the journey eventually may take only about 10 days once infrastructure improvements are completed
but sending goods via train is twice as expensive as shipping them
china and russia have been pushing ahead with their search for alternatives to the southern shipping route via the suez canal in recent years , as tensions in the south china sea have mounted
for russia , the northeastern arctic route would also be a welcome revenue source
given that the route passes along vast stretches within moscows exclusive economic zone , companies seeking to use it would be billed by the russian government
and even though very few ships actually use the route now , the kremlin has ambitious plans for its alternative to the suez canal
it is currently eyeing the shipment of 80 million tons of goods by the middle of the next decade
meanwhile , chinas ambitions in the arctic are both economic and political
with its $ 1 trillion belt and road initiative , beijing is seeking to invest in infrastructure routes across the world to boost its exports and to build economic hubs
a quicker shipping route to europe would naturally fit into those efforts and was included in a white paper published by beijing in january
in its january publication , china called itself a near-arctic state , even though it is located about 1,000 miles from the arctic , and called for a polar silk road.
the northern route would also give china an alternative to a southern route dominated by u.s. allies
