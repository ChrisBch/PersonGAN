anyone who has ever followed british tabloids coverage of germany ( germans declare war on our pound ) will know that some of the divisions of world war ii have yet to fully disappear
thats even more true for two countries that 70 years later are actually still at war japan and russia
it turns out that the two countries never signed a peace treaty after world war ii and the world would probably have forgotten about that unresolved chapter of world history were they not seeking peace now
russian president vladimir putin and his japanese counterpart shinzo abe brought the issue back into the spotlight wednesday when they suggested that they would seek common ground for an official peace deal more than 70 years after the end of hostilities
putin said at the eastern economic forum in vladivostok on wednesday
abe did not indicate whether japan would sign such a deal , but he agreed that the lack of a peace deal is an abnormal state of affairs.
our relations with russia hold unlimited potential , the japanese leader said
such mutual enthusiasm isnt always expressed by countries facing similar issues
south korea and north korea are still technically at war and while both countries have indicated they 're willing to sign a treaty , it turns out that making peace isnt always that easy
given that they were parties to a 1953 armistice that stopped hostilities , beijing and washington would likely have to give their approval to all conditions of a full peace deal , as well
there are some historic examples , too , including the principality of montenegro that was legally at war with japan between 1904 and 2006
at the time , montenegro supported russia in its brief clash with japan
but the principality wasnt a party to the 1905 peace treaty
after it became part of yugoslavia , it was unable to settle the conflict on its own because it no longer existed as a country
its legal state of war with japan only ended when it gained independence in 2006 , more than 100 years after hostilities began
so , what has so far stopped russia and japan from overcoming their divisions
as it is often the case with moscow , theres some disputed land involved
japan and russia have both made claims on a chain of four islands in the pacific ocean located between russias kamchatka peninsula and japans most northern main island , hokkaido
during the war , the soviet union and japan were not involved in direct fighting until the very end
on aug. 9 , 1945 , the soviet union decided to invade manchukuo , a japanese puppet state in what today constitutes northeastern china
the invasion came three days after the united states had dropped an atomic bomb over japans hiroshima
while japan was already about to concede defeat amid pressure from all sides , the soviet unions surprising attack forced the japanese to surrender without conditions
( the japanese were hoping for the soviets to act as a neutral negotiator before the aug. 9 attack )
after japans defeat , the soviet union claimed the four islands in japans north , arguing that japan stole them from russia in the first place when it annexed them in the 19th century
but the japanese refused to acknowledge russias claims and only signed a declaration that ended the state of war in 1956 , while still refusing to sign an actual peace treaty
its unclear how russia and japan are planning to find a solution to this muddled situation
russia has previously offered to give up two of the four islands
but after putin rallied his supporters , saying that the annexation of crimea was a sign of love for the russian motherland , any more substantial territorial concessions in the pacific ocean would be difficult for him to explain
as in crimea , there are also some strategic considerations behind russia 's claims in the pacific , as the four islands are located in waters frequented by russian submarines
meanwhile , japan has insisted that it seeks total control of all four islands and a spokesman for the japanese government said wednesday that the country 's position had not changed
giving in to russian demands would also pose some domestic challenges to japanese leader abe , who has sought to redraw japans pacifist constitution
in 2015 , abe was widely criticized for not repeating a 1995 statement , in which the japanese government offered a heartfelt apology for japans colonial rule and aggression.
at the time , the careful wording was interpreted as a balancing act to win over nationalist supporters while preventing fury in china or the united states
any conditions of a peace treaty between russia and japan would face the same scrutiny
ironically , the relationship between japan and its archenemy china proves that peace treaties can be signed despite lingering territorial disputes
japan and china both claim two sets of small , uninhabited islands in the east china sea , called senkaku by the japanese and diaoyu by the chinese
the two countries still managed to sign a peace treaty in 1978
