if youre serious about peace and denuclearization , maybe dont mention libya
choe son hui , a north korean vice foreign minister , had said hours earlier
the remarks came after pence brought up libya as an example of north koreas possible fate in a fox news interview monday , even though similar comments by trumps national security adviser , john bolton , and trump himself had previously drawn ire in pyongyang
pence told fox news
using almost the same words , trump stressed last week that the example of libya showed what will take place if we dont make a deal.
both were referring to the capture and killing of former libyan leader moammar gaddafi by rebel forces in 2011
the references were apparently meant as a warning to north korea to give up its nuclear weapons
but a closer look at history reveals that libya may be the worst example pence or trump could have chosen and could have contributed to the renewed escalation of tensions in recent days
the north african nation chose to voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and to comply with western conditions but the united states and europe later helped topple the gaddafi regime anyway
its easy to see why pyongyang was becoming more agitated the more washington brought up libya
the george w. bush administration framed libyas denuclearization move as resulting directly from the 2003 u.s.-led invasion of iraq and intelligence operations that cut off delivery routes for libyas nuclear weapons program
in an interview with cnn , gaddafi himself indicated that the toppling of the saddam hussein regime in iraq may have affected his decision to give up the program
then-president bush said when he announced the programs dismantlement , indirectly referring to the iraq war
but analysts voiced criticism of the iraq-libya link at the time and suggested that bush may have been trying to use success in libya to defend his iraq legacy
gaddafis concessions , wrote brookings institution foreign policy analyst martin indyk in early 2004 , were linked mostly to libyas economic crisis after years of sanctions and mismanagement
the only way out was to seek rapprochement with washington , indyk wrote
while north korea has long been able to rely on china , the united states was the dominant power in the middle east in the early 2000s leaving gaddafi few choices
the analyst wrote
multiple reports suggest gaddafis willingness to negotiate an end to his nuclear weapons program was initially rebuffed
when offering to give up the program in exchange for sanctions relief wasnt sufficient , the libyan leader looked for ways to settle his dispute with britain over the bombing of pan am flight 103 in 1988 a u.s. condition for any further talks
overall , 270 people died in the attack , for which gaddafi ultimately acknowledged responsibility in 2003 , even though he maintained he had not ordered the bombing
to settle the conflict with britain , libya agreed to pay at least $ 5 million to the families of each of the 270 victims
the settlement paved the way for the end of libyas nuclear weapons program and verification by international inspectors
four years after giving up his clandestine weapons program , gaddafi appeared rehabilitated as he arrived in paris for a five-day visit
said frances then-president , nicolas sarkozy , defending the visit against critics
when the arab spring began in 2011 , however , sarkozy was among the leaders behind a military intervention in libya that helped topple gaddafi a scenario that would have been hard to imagine had libya been in control of nuclear weapons at the time
