if you 're like most internet users , you 've probably gotten a dozen or more emails this week notifying you of looming privacy policy updates at your favorite websites and perhaps even at a few sites you 'd completely forgotten about
what is the big deal , and why is everyone from airbnb to yelp suddenly updating their terms of service
here 's all you need to know
what the heck is going on
am i being spammed
no , this is the real deal
websites around the world are having to update their policies because of a new set of privacy protections being put in place by the european union
the eu 's general data protection regulation , or gdpr , went into effect on friday
the regulations were written to benefit european citizens by giving them more control over the data that 's collected by online services
but in practice , the new rules will have widespread ramifications as even u.s.-based companies who handle the data of e.u
citizens try to make sure they 're in compliance
the changes you 're seeing in corporate privacy policies is one example
as europe 's data law takes effect , watchdogs go after tech companies
what does gdpr say companies have to do
the new policies , which will be enforced by the information commissioner 's office , require companies to be explicit in their efforts to seek consent from consumers before collecting their personal information
companies also have to give consumers easy access to their own data , and to delete that data if the customer requests it
many companies subject to gdpr are expected to appoint a data protection officer
and importantly , companies have to notify users quickly of data breaches when they occur under the new rules , they have 72 hours to inform the public after a breach is discovered
what happens if the companies violate gdpr
failure to comply with gdpr comes with the risk of heavy fines up to 4 percent of a company 's annual global revenue , or 20 million ( about $ 23 million ) , whichever is higher
in the case of facebook , which pulled in $ 40.7 billion in revenue last year , a violation could mean an eye-popping $ 1.6 billion penalty
in fact , facebook has already been hit with lawsuits alleging violations of gdpr on the policy 's very first day in response , the company has said it 's been working to comply with gdpr for the past 18 months
i 'm in europe
why ca n't i access some u.s. sites
a number of u.s.-based news sites the los angeles times , chicago tribune , baltimore sun and a raft of others have basically gone offline as far as european readers are concerned
when you try to visit any of these sites from a european location , you get this ( i tested it with a vpn )
the common denominator underneath these different publications is that they are all owned by the same parent company , tronc
we continue to identify technical compliance solutions that will provide all readers with our award-winning journalism
unlike other news outlets such as npr , which have updated their privacy policies in light of the new regulations , tronc appears to have sidestepped having to comply with gdpr by simply making its sites unavailable to e.u
( the washington post , for its part , has updated its privacy policy and introduced a new subscription tier for readers who do not wish to have their data collected , said miki king , vice president of marketing at the post )
what are the downsides for consumers
some companies have chosen to go blank in europe instead of having to comply with the expansive privacy regulations , including websites such as unroll.me and klout
more widely accessed u.s. media outlets including the chicago tribune , the los angeles times and the baltimore sun similarly blocked some of their european users starting friday
it is uncertain when or if those websites will become accessible again
so , if its all so complicated , why did europe bother to introduce the rules
european union regulators have always been much tougher on tech companies than their u.s. counterparts , for instance forcing them to give users more control , imposing fines for noncompliance and requiring platforms to spot and delete illegal content
depending on the e.u
countries , there is generally also more public backing here than in the united states for the sort of expansive regulations that took effect friday at least as long as they dont turn the internet into a bureaucratic nightmare
where can i go to find out more
here 's a detailed checklist of the things companies must do to be in compliance
and here 's where you can find the text of gdpr itself
