but that optimistic view of an astronauts life can come crashing to earth when youre circling the globe from 254 miles up and start noticing how the worlds northern hemisphere is gradually turning from lush green to dry brown
he wrote , posting photos from the international space station
just had a chance to take my first photos of dried-out central europe and germany since a few weeks , and was shocked
what should have been green , is now all brown
never seen it like this before
over the following days , gerst tweeted more photos showing detailed views of areas affected by drought and heat , including portugal , where firefighters continued to battle blazes across the country on thursday
dramatische wetterlage heute ber portugal
sieht nach einer mischung aus staub , sand und rauch aus.dramatic weather pattern over portugal today

gerst later tweeted a striking comparison with photos from a prior space station stint in summer 2014 , when europes forests and fields were still pleasantly green

krasser unterschied , mit bloem auge aus dem weltraum sichtbar ... -- -here for comparison a few photos from 2014 , big difference , visible from space with the naked eye ...
ahead of summer 2014 , meteorologists had predicted a similar heat wave , but temperatures remained mostly normal

britons were the first to point out that their royal parks had turned into yellow-brownish wastelands , amid an absence of the precipitation thats so deeply associated with the country
across europe , temperatures reached or exceeded the 100s ( fahrenheit ) this summer , posing a deadly risk
only 3 to 5 percent of european households are air-conditioned , compared with almost 90 percent of households in the united states
european authorities see links between the unusual heat and global warming , predicting far more unusually hot summers in the future
with no end to the heat wave in sight , astronaut gerst and his colleagues might be well advised to stay in space until its all over
