after more than two months , 66-year-old former russian spy sergei skripal has been discharged from the hospital after being poisoned by a military-grade nerve agent , british authorities said friday
the former russian double agent and his daughter , yulia skripal , were attacked in the southern english city of salisbury on march 4 and found slumped over on a park bench
last month , british officials said for the first time that skripal was no longer in critical condition , having joined his daughter in a recovery that could lead to the pair helping investigators uncover what happened march 4
skripal was still being questioned by investigators as recently as this week , according to british media reports
cara charles-barks , the hospitals chief executive , said in a statement friday
the hospital did not release a detailed assessment of the skripals recovery , citing the two patients right to privacy
british prime minister theresa may condemned the poisoning as a reckless and hostile act by russia on british soil
may subsequently decided to expel 23 russian diplomats from britain in the biggest such move since 1985 , years before the end of the cold war
at least 26 other countries , including many european union member states , the united states and australia , joined the retaliatory measures after may provided confidential evidence about russias alleged involvement
the documents have not been made public
may and her government say that in addition to the forensic evidence shared with allies , russia is also suspected because it has assassinated critics abroad before
skripal was a double agent who sold secrets to britain
he was convicted and jailed in russia but released in a swap of intelligence agents in 2010
but russia has denied having anything to do with the attack
top russian diplomats have insisted that britain either rushed or bungled the investigation or that british agents themselves may have poisoned the father and daughter to smear russia , justify increases in military spending or distract residents from the failures of brexit negotiations
british authorities have refused to discuss the security arrangements in place after the skripals discharge , and they are shielding the two former patients from the public
dismayed by britains secrecy , the russian government has repeatedly criticized londons reluctance to provide russian diplomats access to the skripals
russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said during a news briefing on wednesday
