as americas midterm elections draw closer , the countrys polarization feels starker than in any previous cycle , and this time , the campaign is playing out not only on metaphorical stages , but on real ones , too
on sunday , taylor swift broke her political silence when she took to instagram to endorse a democratic candidate , encouraging her 112 million followers to register to vote
but swifts pro-democratic message was soon challenged by another musician , kanye west , who held a bizarre meeting with president trump in the white house on thursday , discussing racism , jobs and how he feels like superman with a trump hat
sure , mixing politics and arts might be annoying
but its worth keeping in mind what societies look like when artists arent free to speak their minds , and the incredibly long and rich tradition of artists agitating for freedom
the u.n. organization wrote in a damning summary
iranian musician mehdi rajabian has experienced such intimidation tactics
the 30-year-old spent two years in tehrans notorious evin prison with his brother , hossein , a filmmaker , after they were found guilty of breaching the countrys tough censorship laws that require all artists to obtain government licenses to produce and disseminate music
the duo had no such license , but their label , barg music , quickly became a heavyweight in irans underground music scene until authorities busted their business
after rajabians condition deteriorated following a hunger strike , authorities temporarily hospitalized him in 2015
at the time , rajabian was able to get in touch with my colleague ishaan tharoor , telling him via a messaging app that he had lost 33 pounds and 40 percent of his vision.
the album is produced by mehdi rajabian

currently out of prison after a temporary release , rajabian is refusing to back down , even though he is not allowed to work as an artist in iran or leave the country
for his latest project , still unpublished , he assembled dozens of musicians from across the middle east to protest oppression and human rights violations
rajabian wrote in a message
other artists involved in the project agreed that music could offer a defense of human rights , even if musicians themselves held differing political views.
music serves the culture and culture saves nations , 42-year-old palestinian musician wasim qassis was quoted as saying
