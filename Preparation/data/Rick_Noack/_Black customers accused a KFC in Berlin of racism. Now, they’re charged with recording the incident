berlin kfc is facing racism accusations in germany after a group of black customers were thrown out of one of its berlin stores on monday
in a video distributed online and recorded by a member of that group , police officers can be seen escorting the group out of the restaurant
( the misspellings are in the original post )
berlins police department strongly rejected the accusations on thursday and announced it would press charges against the individuals who were involved in recording and uploading the video for violating the officers privacy laws
the video immediately triggered outrage on social media , even though kfc denied that racism triggered the incident
a spokeswoman for berlins police department similarly said on thursday that a kfc employee called officers to the store , complaining about ongoing vandalism.
according to a police spokeswoman
in a statement on thursday , kfc said that the groups behavior alarmed several individuals , who were in the store at the time
after mediation efforts failed , an employee called authorities
german officials defended their subsequent response , saying that kfc has property rights and is allowed to ask individuals to leave
said pierre , referring to a restaurant employee giving the group the choice to either be quieter or leave the restaurant
pierre told die welt
according to the german paper , the group had come to berlin from britain on a tourism trip

the incident reminded some of the arrest of two african american men at a philadelphia starbucks last month
both men were charged with trespassing and creating a disturbance after sitting at the store without ordering a beverage or food
the charges were later dropped and the two men agreed to a symbolic payment of $ 1 each , asking the city to fund $ 200,000 for a grant program for high school students aspiring to become entrepreneurs instead
in response to the arrest that was caught on video , starbucks closed 8,000 stores for one afternoon to conduct racial-bias training
kfc germany , however , insisted in a statement on thursday that its franchise partners employees had acted correctly
