berlin as hitlers national socialist german workers party rose to power in berlin during the 1930s , the economic woes of the doomed weimar republic forced tens of thousands of workers to migrate abroad
some of them ended up in brazil , where the national socialists soon established their own branch , which became the biggest outside germany
but a century on , some of brazils memories of the nazis horrifying legacy appear to have faded
this month , germanys embassy in brazil was forced to remind people that nazis were indeed right-wing and not left-wing , as some brazilian commentators have claimed
the embassys caption read
the video , however , came in the midst of a deeply divided presidential campaign
the original video itself drew a direct link between germanys contemporary far right and concerns that some of its ideology is based on right-wing extremist nazi thoughts from the world war ii era
some brazilian far-right supporters then appeared to regard the embassys association of nazis with the right wing as slanderous

right-wing extremists
the hitler party was called party of socialist workers , wrote one commentator , responding on facebook
i feel like you want to influence the election , another brazilian argued , writing that the diplomats had provided no evidence that nazism is right-wing.
while hitlers party carried the word socialist in its name , only a few of the policies pursued by him were left-wing or indeed socialist
political scientists today assume the nazis mainly added the word to gain the support of working-class voters who had previously supported left-wing parties
the upcoming elections in early october could become the most contentious in recent brazilian history bolsonaro is the current front-runner even though he is deeply unpopular among parts of the polarized electorate
his critics at times have referred to him as a nazi or a far-right firebrand a characterization his supporters reject
but bolsonaro has been recorded making racist remarks , slandering a left-leaning congresswoman and attacking lgbt communities
after inadvertently becoming involved in that domestic dispute , the german embassy this week opted for a safer subject it posted a video of germanys first amphibious bus
