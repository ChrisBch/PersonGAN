a man stabbed to death his sister and mother thursday morning in a suburb west of paris and seriously injured at least one more person
although the islamic state claimed the incident , authorities are not calling it an act of terrorism
french interior minister gerard collomb described the man as a criminal who had significant psychiatric problems and said the attack was likely not an act of terrorism
he told reporters at the scene of the incident in the suburb of trappes
the attacker was killed by police after he came out of his mothers house wielding a knife and ignored shouted warnings , collomb added
an investigation into his motives is still underway
struggling to prevent terrorist attacks , france wants to reform islam
referring to countries fighting the islamic state
located about 16 miles from the center of paris , trappes has long been a recruitment ground for supporters of the islamic state and other militant groups
french media reported that the man had been on the countrys national security watch list since 2016 for defending a terrorist attack , but it appears that thursdays incident was a family dispute
the islamic states claim thursday was issued before authorities confirmed that the attackers two victims were his relatives
if no terrorism link is found , it would fit into a string of misleading claims issued by the amaq agency , as the islamic state has faced significant setbacks over the last two years , losing most of the territory it previously held
the attack came just hours after islamic state leader abu bakr al-baghdadi issued his first message in almost a year to mark the islamic eid al-adha holiday
he encouraged his followers to carry out lone-wolf attacks in europe and north america and to stab their bodies.
france has been hit by a string of high-profile terrorist attacks , including a shooting at the offices of a prominent satirical magazine and a rampage through paris in november 2015
a total of 230 people have been killed in france in the past three years in terrorist attacks , most of which were carried out by french or other european nationals inspired by the islamic state
