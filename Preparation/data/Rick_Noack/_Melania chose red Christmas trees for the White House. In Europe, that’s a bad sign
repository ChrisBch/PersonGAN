berlin when melania trumps white house christmas wonderland was revealed this week , visitors couldnt escape a certain feeling that one color was being displayed more prominently than others red
there were red ornaments and red drawings
and there were red christmas trees , comprising thousands of berries
abroad , however , its also the color of sick christmas trees
ukraine renamed the area around the chernobyl reactor disaster site red forest after lethal radioactivity turned the green pine trees there red-brownish in 1986
footage from that forest still serves as a reminder of deadly nuclear risks , especially at a time when threatening nuclear strikes has become more common again
more recently , the color red has also been disastrous for pine trees in denmark , which are usually sold across europe
the country is renowned for its magnificent dark-green trees that are exported far beyond its borders , but red needles are posing a growing threat to the lucrative business
nine million trees are sold every year
melania trump didnt show up to explain her spooky christmas decorations
so what about those red trees
in some years since 2012 , denmarks vendors have had to dispose of as much as 10 percent of all christmas trees that were supposed to go on sale after their needles lost their green shine
selling trees with red needles , vendors argued in interviews with nordic media outlets , would have damaged the industrys excellent reputation
christmas tree producers remain stymied by what is causing the strange phenomenon
the danish christmas tree growers association concluded , specifying that the problem has already caused damage of up to $ 8 million
torben ravn , a board member of the christmas tree association , told the danish broadcasting corp. two years ago
a research project has been tasked with investigating the source of the problem
one possible explanation is that diseases might be weakening the trees ability to take in sufficient calcium to grow properly
in neighboring germany , where vendors have faced a similar issue , researchers also observed that pine trees can sunburn , provided that springs are unusually cold and summers disproportionately hot
climate change will make those extreme temperatures occur far more frequently
unless a solution is found , europe might have to embrace christmastime red more than it has done in the past
the white house where president trump dismissed a dire climate change report by his own administration this week , saying , i dont believe it may have some advice on how to do it
