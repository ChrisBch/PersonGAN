british prime minister theresa may is under pressure from all sides , including hard-line brexiteers within her own conservative party
mays era as prime minister has been declared over before , and she has shown no signs of giving in to her critics
but staying in office isnt entirely up to may herself
there are two key scenarios that might result in her departure
chances of the first scenario a no-confidence vote triggered by her own party increased on friday , as at least 20 letters were submitted by conservative party members of parliament , demanding a vote on mays future
thats still far from the required threshold of 48 letters ( or 15 percent of all tory mps ) , but delegates are not required to make their submissions public
so , when key party officials were ordered back to london on friday morning , warning signs mounted that a leadership vote may be imminent
triggering the procedure alone would not topple the british prime minister , as she could survive if a simple majority of tory mps backed her
a substantial number of lawmakers would likely opt to keep may in power to prevent a so-called no-deal brexit , which has been embraced by some hard-line conservative mps
on top of that , any successor would face the same unrealistic expectations from all sides of the political spectrum that have derailed mays plans
can brexit be stopped
a guide for those just waking up to britains political nightmare
but hard-line mps in favor of getting rid of may would point to a tory rule that would prevent another leadership challenge for at least a year
following substantial election losses last year , mays era was widely believed to be doomed
her party critics who are far more numerous than the hardcore brexiteers behind the current challenge may be unwilling to essentially grant her at least another year in office
and while may might survive the rebellion on paper , an unexpectedly high number of votes against her would put additional pressure on her to resign
even if may did not face a tory challenge or survived it , her government may still run into another obstacle that is also connected to last years election outcome
after mays conservatives fell short of a parliamentary majority , the prime minister negotiated a confidence and supply power-sharing agreement with northern irelands democratic unionist party
the dup has threatened to withdraw from that agreement several times
the party reportedly repeated those threats this week , indicating that it may withdraw unless may is removed as party leader because her deal with the e.u
may result in some regulatory checks between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom
the dup believes that such checks could tear the country apart
ousting may that way would increase the chances of new elections and , perhaps , of a second referendum
