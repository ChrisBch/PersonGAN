theresa mays premiership has been declared dead before
after her election losses last year , the british prime minister appeared to be on the brink of resigning
as she left 10 downing street on thursday morning , members of her own party again wondered how long can she last
in the early morning hours , several of her cabinet ministers resigned over mays draft deal to leave the european union , which was released wednesday
may probably expected some resignations , but one was unexpected dominic raab , her second brexit minister
with the official who negotiated mays brexit deal writing that he can not support the proposed deal , the government was suddenly thrown into jeopardy
in an evening news conference , may vowed to fight for her deal and rejected any suggestions that she might be on the way out of office
but may is under attack from both sides of the political spectrum
staunch pro-brexiteers argue the deal does not go far enough and would keep britain under the sway of the e.u
while taking away all powers to shape that bloc
pro-european members of parliament ( mps ) , meanwhile , think that britain should stay more closely aligned with e.u
laws and within the blocs customs union
when may told parliament on thursday that we will leave the e.u
in a smooth and orderly way , her remarks were met with laughter by lawmakers
so , what could be next
here are some of the likely scenarios
1 ) mps vote in favor of mays deal
even though mays deal pleases neither pro-european nor pro-brexit mps , the prime minister may still have leverage to push through her deal or a modified version of it
the most powerful argument in her favor would be that the problem might not be her , but brexit itself
while her deal is imperfect on many levels , it would still help britain avoid a no deal brexit that could cost jobs and trigger a recession
at the same time , there has been cross-party agreement to respect the results of the 2016 referendum to leave the e.u
many mps who want to uphold that promise but are scared of a no-deal brexit will back may
still , the prime minister is not believed to have the necessary votes for that to happen , and with every minister resignation , chances are getting slimmer
2 ) mps vote against mays deal or dump her
she cant bank on much support from the opposition
the scottish national party is disgruntled that it was left out of the negotiations , and the liberal democrats will vote against the deal out of principle
most labour party members are expected to also reject the agreement , partially because a may defeat increases the likelihood of a future labour prime minister
worse even , may is facing a rebellion among her own allies
pro-brexiteers will vote against her deal , and the party that has kept her in power since last year the northern irish democratic unionist party ( dup ) might join them
the dup leadership fears mays deal could create a de facto border between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom
thats a red line for a party committed to keeping northern ireland fully within the u.k
labour can not topple may by itself , but the prime ministers own allies may help with that
moreover , if the dup were to withdraw from its agreement to keep the conservative party led by may or any successor in power , then new general elections would be almost inevitable
without the dup , the tories lack a majority in parliament
a no-deal brexit is unpopular but may be inevitable
if mays deal is rejected , chances of a no-deal brexit rise
while leading pro-brexiteers have said that they would prefer this scenario over a bad deal , a no-deal brexit would probably not be a deliberate choice but instead an accidental outcome of a government unable to obtain a majority for any better solution
most stakeholders know very well that a no-deal brexit could have catastrophic repercussions on the british economy
as an island , britain is dependent on its trade with the e.u. , and a no-deal brexit would disrupt all those ties overnight
the government may have to ship in goods to keep supermarkets stocked , and nobody knows for sure what the effect of a no-deal brexit would be on the millions of europeans working in britain
given the risks of a no-deal brexit , parliament could theoretically reject mays deal until christmas and still approve a similar document next year
but even then , it would be unclear what sort of relationship britain would have with the e.u
in the long term
what would britains immigration policy look like , especially as think tanks predict that the country will face a severe labor shortage going forward
could it stay in the customs union permanently to prevent a border between northern ireland and the rest of the country
theoretically , britain could extend the agreed transition period in which britain would continue to abide by e.u
rules without having a say on shaping them year after year , arguing that britain isnt ready to fully withdraw , yet
but in that case , britain would be outside the e.u
only on paper
thats one of the reasons labour leader jeremy corbyn said thursday that he can not accept having to choose between no deal and mays deal
going back to brussels
the question is what other choices there are
corbyn has implied that going back to brussels to get a better agreement could be one way out of the dilemma
but the e.u
has proved over the past year that it is bound by its own treaties and has little interest in adapting its rules to british demands
its unclear why that would change under corbyn , unless he agreed to stick to staying in the single market and the customs union
this would mean britain would essentially still be subject to e.u
laws , which has been rejected many times by all parties
such a solution would probably be possible only in the unlikely scenario that corbyns labour party campaigned on that promise in general elections and won an overwhelming mandate for it or supported a second referendum
supporters of a new vote on britains e.u
membership argue that a second referendum is not only an option but also a must , given that the promises on which pro-brexit politicians campaigned have largely proved to be misleading
critics maintain that posing the same question again because mps didnt like the british peoples response would ruin trust in british democracy
amid all the confusion , theres one certainty , though britain has only four more months left to figure it all out
its set to either leave or crash out of the e.u
