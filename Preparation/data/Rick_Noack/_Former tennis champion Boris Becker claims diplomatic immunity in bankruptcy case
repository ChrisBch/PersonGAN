london boris becker was never known for being particularly diplomatic on the tennis court , and the three-time wimbledon champions frequent outbursts are still legendary
so it probably raised a few eyebrows when becker announced that he was pursuing a second career in diplomacy
in april , the german sports star said that he had been named the central african republics attach for sports/humanitarian/cultural affairs in the european union
diplomatic honours for me
i have been appointed by the central african republic as its attache for sports/humanitarian/cultural affairs in the european union
the announcement came while becker was being sued over money he allegedly owes to private bank arbuthnot latham after his bankruptcy last year
and , coincidence or not , beckers lawyers argue that his diplomatic role grants him diplomatic immunity under the 1961 vienna convention on diplomatic relations
this means he can not be subject to legal process in the courts of any country for so long as he remains a recognized diplomatic agent , his legal team wrote in a letter
he may not be made subject to any legal process , whatever the merits , without the express consent of the central african republic and legal claims can only be served on him through diplomatic channels , the statement continues
if becker were to be prosecuted , other states could potentially use the case to target diplomats abroad who are protected by the same immunity
in a statement posted online , becker appeared to preempt possible allegations that he may have accepted his diplomatic role for the car to gain diplomatic immunity from the lawsuit
i am immensely proud of my appointment at the sports and culture attach for the central african republic
sports is incredibly important in africa and is fast becoming a universal language , a form of social diplomacy and a leveller between people from vastly different and unequal social backgrounds around the world , becker wrote
there is no reason why a role of this kind should be treated any differently to an appointment as a military or a trade attach , he continued
the former tennis champion also condemned the decision to commence bankruptcy proceedings against him as unjustified and unjust and announced that he would seek compensation for the completely unnecessary declaration of bankruptcy that he was forced into
the trustees overseeing beckers bankruptcy case denied the accusations friday
we welcome mr beckers appointment to promote sport in the central african republic
however , we believe that it has no material impact on mr beckers bankruptcy , mark ford , the lead joint trustee , was quoted as saying
article 29 of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations , which specifies that the person of a diplomatic agent shall be inviolable , has long been controversial
in 2014 , for instance , saudi businessman sheikh walid juffali was named permanent representative by the small caribbean island of st. lucia after his former wife christina estrada made separation claims
britains high court ruled in 2016 that his diplomatic status was entirely artificial , drawing rare governmental condemnations
britains foreign office criticized the ruling at the time , saying it could lead to british diplomats statuses abroad being unjustifiably curtailed , and an appeals court dismissed the high courts assessment
but as a permanent resident of britain , the court of appeal ruled , juffali was still not protected by his diplomatic immunity
estrada was subsequently awarded about $ 100 million
if the same logic were to be applied in beckers case , the longtime british resident might discover that he isnt protected by his work with the car , after all
