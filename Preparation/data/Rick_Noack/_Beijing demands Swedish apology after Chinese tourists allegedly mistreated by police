in the past , it was usually sweden that accused china of human rights violations
but following the release of several videos purportedly showing the mistreatment of a group of chinese tourists in stockholm earlier this month , the tables appear to have turned
the footage already watched more than 100 million times shows swedish police officers forcibly ejecting a group of three chinese tourists from a hostel lobby on sept. 2 as the son of the family shouts this is killing
this is killing
in footage recorded later on , the father and mother can be seen weeping on the sidewalk next to the hostel
speaking to swedish media , the hostel owner defended the measures taken against the family , saying that the three individuals had arrived hours before their booking and became verbally abusive after being denied access to a room
the hostel manager was quoted as saying by swedish daily aftonbladet
neither the hostel nor swedish police officials immediately responded to a request for comment on monday
but the familys son told chinese media that the hostel refused his request to let his mother and father stay in the lobby as they were waiting for a room to become available
he says he made the hostel aware of his parents fragile health but was instead ejected from the building by arriving police officers
beijing subsequently issued a safety alert for chinese visitors to sweden
chinas ambassador to sweden , gui congyou , said in an interview published monday
the strongly worded response may also have political motives
sweden and china have clashed over a number of human rights issues in recent months , including last week when the swedish government welcomed the spiritual head of tibet , the dalai lama
beijing claims tibet as part of china and accuses the dalai lama of encouraging violent separatism , a charge he rejects
in january , chinese-born swedish publisher gui minhai was detained in china while he was traveling with swedish diplomats
he still has not been released
beijing has issued a number of warnings in recent years for chinese visitors heading to europe , citing threats in germany , britain , the netherlands and other countries
last year , the chinese embassy in berlin issued a safety alert , writing that an increasing number of chinese tourists had become victims of violent attacks
the chinese claims emerged even as german crime statistics showed a drop in overall crime incidents
the chinese embassy in germany recommended.
once youre back at home , make sure nobody followed you.
in 2016 , the chinese embassy in the netherlands said in a statement that it was shocked by footage showing an attack on chinese tourists in the country with milk powder
as was the case in stockholm , the incident gained attention only after it started trending on chinese social media
