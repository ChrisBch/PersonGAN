berlin journalists are supposed to be observers of and not stakeholders in the events they cover , no matter if theyre working in a small town in eastern europe or in the white house
but as journalists around the world themselves have increasingly become targets , many of them have wondered at what point it is justified to put down the pen and speak up and they have come to very different conclusions
the reporter excluded from the press briefing , michael sauerbier , had asked critical questions during a previous press event about a senior afd officials alleged ties to a right-wing extremist group
it wasnt the first time that reporters had been excluded by the afd , but with attacks mounting and the rhetoric sharpening , all journalists in the room immediately agreed on what to do
they left the room the news conference was canceled
if any of those present at the time were watching the testy exchange between president trump and cnn white house reporter jim acosta on wednesday , they might have had some flashbacks to that day in may
during wednesdays post-midterms news conference , acosta asked whether trump had demonized immigrants by calling a caravan of central american migrants an invasion.
when a white house intern attempted to take back the microphone , acosta resisted by raising his arm
pardon me , maam , he told the woman
he asked on twitter this may
and on wednesday , the white house appeared to follow through with those threats for the first time , when it suspended acostas press credentials in an unprecedented move
in other nations where far-right parties are openly threatening democratic principles or where journalists have to fear for their lives , acosta was widely celebrated on thursday morning
meanwhile , in india , his combative questioning of the president earned him fans on social media , where some praised his willingness to take on the commander in chief
us media vs indian media
one user created a video clip contrasting acostas questions with footage from an event in 2015 , when indian prime minister narendra modi hosted a holiday event for journalists and they mobbed him to take selfies
modi has not held a news conference where journalists could freely ask questions during his entire time in office
foreign journalists were not alone in their support for acosta
during the testy wednesday news conference , the reporter trump called on next immediately rushed to his colleagues defense
but should u.s. correspondents go down the path of their foreign colleagues and boycott briefings
the bar for such action has been relatively high abroad
in one case , foreign journalists walked out of an israeli news conference with prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his australian counterpart , malcolm turnbull , last year after guards ordered a strip search of a european press agency photographer
the incident was later described as needless and humiliating by the countrys foreign press association , and coverage of it embarrassed the israeli government
in the case of the german afd incident , the walkout appears to have had impact , too
senior party officials recently held a roundtable discussion with leading german editors , with the expressed aim to encourage more moderate dialogue , even though the fake news slogans have not faded from the streets
the afd and trump are , of course , hardly comparable
trump has at times engaged with the media and at other times lashed out at them
he has threatened to sue outlets but has not followed through , so far
the afd , meanwhile , is an opposition party with limited influence
when former u.s. press secretary sean spicer excluded several news organizations from an off-camera press briefing last february but invited conservative publications to join , only a few media outlets decided to boycott the event
the reasons for refraining to boycott the briefing were diverse some argued that continuing to cover the administration was more important than setting an example
other , more polarized news outlets appeared pleased to be favored
in contrast , germany has a more moderate media landscape , in which far-left or right-wing publications and networks have so far gained little traction
german journalists often issue statements through joint umbrella associations when they fear violations of press freedom , regardless of their papers editorial stances
