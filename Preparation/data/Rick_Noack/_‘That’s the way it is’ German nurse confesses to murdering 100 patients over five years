berlin niels hoegel , a 41-year old former german nurse , confessed on tuesday to one of europes most gruesome mass murder cases since world war ii and admitted to killing 100 patients between 2000 and 2005
hoegel had already been sentenced to life in prison after being charged with at least six murders and several more attempts
but prosecutors pushed for a new trial after details indicated hoegel may have killed 100 more victims , injecting them with deadly drugs such as lidocaine and calcium chloride , according to prosecutors who said hoegel acted out of boredom.
the death toll may be even higher than assumed , because some victims between ages 34 and 96 were cremated
more than 130 other bodies were exhumed during the investigation
as his trial got underway tuesday , hoegel admitted that the accusations were largely correct.
thats the way it is , he said
his mass murder went unnoticed for years , partially because many of the patients he treated were already critically ill and because hoegel tried to resuscitate his victims after deliberately putting them on the brink of death
in some cases , patients survived the ordeal , but records show that fatality rates regularly increased when hoegel was on shift
investigators are also probing the responsibility of the hospitals where hoegel worked
authorities said that staff there was aware of irregularities but failed to act
even when hoegel was caught administering his deadly drug cocktail to one victim in 2005 , hospital officials did not immediately intervene
they only reached out to authorities after hoegel killed yet another patient , using the same method
the nurse has claimed he acted spontaneously and repeatedly vowed to never kill again
in 2015 , he apologized for his crimes , saying that he was honestly sorry.
hundreds of relatives backed the new trial against hoegel , even though the former nurses sentence wont substantially change
german criminals sentenced to life in prison usually only spend 15 years behind bars
german laws also do not allow for consecutive prison terms , so hoegel could theoretically walk free within little more than a decade , unless he is barred from an early release at the end of the trial that is now underway
