kungsangen , sweden for many young europeans , a post-high-school gap year has become a rite of passage
instead of proceeding straight to work or college , hundreds of thousands of newly graduated high school students enjoy a year of travel to see the world and celebrate their newfound freedom
but a growing number of those young men and women face a much different post-graduation interlude military service
after the cold war , many european countries abolished conscription , considering it an expensive relic
but with russia resurgent and tensions on the rise , mandatory military service is making a comeback across the continent
this year , sweden drafted its first new class of conscripts since abolishing the draft in 2010
lithuania has also reinstated conscription , and norway began drafting women for the first time in 2016
meanwhile , lawmakers in italy , romania and germany have debated reintroducing some form of conscription in recent months
french president emmanuel macron is pushing for the introduction of a national service program that would include a military option and last between one month and a year
and there are no signs that denmark , estonia , finland , cyprus , greece , austria or switzerland will get rid of their conscription systems anytime soon
said elisabeth braw , an associate fellow at the royal united services institute for defense and security studies in london.
but theres also an economic argument it has been very hard to recruit for the armed forces , especially in northern european countries , where the economy is doing well
in some nations , including germany and france , bringing back mandatory national service for both men and women is also being discussed as a possible way to integrate migrants into increasingly polarized societies
estonia officially considers its draft as a way to integrate the countrys russian minority

but in sweden , the draft is still fundamentally about security.
our military is not an integration school , said ewa skoog haslum , the deputy vice chancellor of the swedish defense university ,
said lars fresker , a spokesman for the swedish officers union
the number of drafted recruits will eventually reach 8,000 a year
the swedish military says that few recruits object to being drafted
and at kungsangen , the base where the swedish military trains most of its draftees , several soldiers agreed that being drafted felt like a positive step
said 19-year-old sally granditsky , formerly a student at a stockholm design school
she conceded that she probably would never have joined the military without the draft i think i would have been too lazy to apply , she said but could now see herself staying and becoming an officer
viktor arridsson , 19 , had not yet decided whether to stay in the military , but he said that the draft teaches us lessons which people who dont do it miss out on
you get to know yourself
its good that they brought it back , he said
