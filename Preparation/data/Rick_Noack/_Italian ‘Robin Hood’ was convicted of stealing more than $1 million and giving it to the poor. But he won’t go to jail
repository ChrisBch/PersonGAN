when the financial crisis wreaked havoc across the globe in 2009 , a bank manager in the small italian town of forni di sopra decided he had to do something to help those most affected
in testimony later provided to prosecutors , gilberto baschiera described how he increasingly struggled to justify rejecting loan requests from residents who were too poor to qualify
at the time , the italian government was desperately trying to prevent the countrys looming bankruptcy but kept falling short of targets set by the european union and other creditors
amid what he felt was an absence of alternatives , baschiera decided to take matters into his own hands
he set up a shadowy banking system in the town of 1,100 people , taking money from wealthy clients and secretly transferring it to the accounts of poorer residents so that they could qualify for loans
within seven years , baschiera diverted 1 million euros ( $ 1.15 million ) , according to prosecutors

then , in 2016 , the scheme went bust
clients had defaulted on their loans and were unable to pay baschiera back
the systems implosion turned baschiera into a hero for some italian journalists , and italys libero newspaper called him a modern robin hood , referring to the legendary english bandit who stole from the rich to give to the poor
but authorities were already investigating
said baschieras lawyer , roberto mete , speaking to the bbc
mete could not be reached for comment on thursday
investigators determined that baschiera had not personally benefited from the scheme , which helped him strike a deal with prosecutors
baschiera was convicted and sentenced on monday to two years in prison , but he wont have to go to jail due to a provision in italian law that allows courts to show leniency on first-time offenders who were handed relatively short prison sentences

in similar cases in other countries , courts have been far less forgiving
in 2007 , a 45-year-old german banker was sentenced to almost three years in prison after setting up a scheme to divert about $ 2.4 million from wealthier clients accounts to poorer customers whose loan requests would otherwise have been rejected
two years later , an american court sentenced another bank manager to a year in prison after she diverted more than $ 300,000 over eight years
the court doubted whether all of the money had in fact been given to people in need
in italy , baschieras supporters argued throughout his trial that the former bank manager was left with only painful options after the financial crisis prompted a tightening of loan procedures
between 2008 and 2011 , italys huge debt load quickly became one of the european unions most pressing concerns
some feared a greek default could cause a domino effect and drag italy along with it
europe later managed to bail out greeces comparably small economy , but it might not have been able to rescue italy the euro zones third-largest economy
to prevent a default , then-italian prime minister silvio berlusconi opted for harsh austerity measures that ended up hindering a vast number of italians from qualifying for loans
berlusconi later went on trial , facing corruption charges and accusations of sex with underage girls and was handed several prison sentences
all of the sentences were waived or reduced
today , berlusconi and his children are believed to own about $ 6.8 billion , according to forbes magazine
meanwhile , former italian bank manager baschiera would probably not qualify for a loan himself these days the conviction cost him both his home and his job , according to italys repubblica newspaper
