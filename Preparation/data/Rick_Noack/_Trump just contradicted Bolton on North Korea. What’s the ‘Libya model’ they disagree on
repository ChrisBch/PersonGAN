president trump contradicted his national security adviser thursday on north korea policy after an angry rebuke from pyongyang over john boltons comments
bolton had recently suggested that libya could serve as a model for persuading north korea to give up its nuclear weapons program
he added , in libya , we decimated that country
that country was decimated.
with the prospect of a june summit with north korean leader kim jong un under a cloud , trump even offered reassurances that regime change is not on the agenda
in any deal with north korea , trump said , kim would be in his country hed be running his country.
nonetheless , the president also cautioned that the fate suffered by libya shows what will take place if we dont make a deal.
libyas moammar gaddafi was captured and killed by rebel forces in 2011 during the arab spring uprising
his government had voluntarily decided to give up its nuclear weapons program in 2003
trumps remarks immediately raised doubts about whether he and bolton had the same idea of what the libya model really means
while trump appeared to be referring to gaddafis toppling in 2011 , bolton was referring to the need to build trust and verify any denuclearization efforts when he brought up libya in a cbs interview last month
he didnt imply , publicly at least , that the libya model would include regime change in north korea
boltons remarks , north korea said wednesday , sounded awfully sinister.
trumps attempt at clarification on thursday probably wont sound any better to pyongyang
what bolton didnt mention was that north korea already had rejected a verification scheme based on the libya model 10 years ago
in 2008 , the united states proposed a verification process to pyongyang that was based on inspection processes previously used in libya
north korea objected to two key elements of that plan the taking of samples and visits to undeclared facilities
prior resistance to that plan and north koreas long-standing animosity toward bolton may explain pyongyangs anger and its subsequent threat to cancel the upcoming summit
north korea said in a statement on wednesday
( former iraqi leader saddam hussein was hanged in 2006 )
regardless of whether libya can serve as a model for north korea , how did the united states persuade gaddafi in 2003 and 2004 to give up his early-stage nuclear weapons program
and why was the libyan regime ultimately toppled
the answers , it appears , depend on whom youre asking
the george w. bush administration framed libyas move as resulting directly from the 2003 u.s.-led iraq invasion and intelligence operations that cut off delivery routes for libyas nuclear weapons program
in an interview with cnn , gaddafi himself indicated that the toppling of the hussein regime in iraq may have affected his decision to give up the program
president george w. bush said when he announced the programs dismantlement , indirectly referring to the iraq war
but analysts voiced criticism of the iraq-libya link at the time and suggested that bush may have been trying to use success in libya to defend his iraq legacy
gaddafis concessions , wrote brookings foreign policy analyst martin indyk in early 2004 , were linked mostly to libyas economic crisis after years of sanctions and mismanagement
the only way out was to seek rapprochement with washington , indyk wrote
and while north korea has long been able to rely on china , the united states was the dominant power in the middle east in the early 2000s leaving gaddafi few choices
the analyst wrote
reports suggest that gaddafis willingness to negotiate an end to his nuclear weapons program was initially rebuffed
when offering to give up the program in exchange for sanctions relief wasnt sufficient , the libyan leader looked for ways to settle his dispute with britain over the bombing of pan am flight 103 in 1988 a u.s. condition for any further talks
overall , 270 people died in the attack , for which gaddafi claimed responsibility in 2003 , even though he maintained that he had not ordered the bombing
to settle the conflict with britain , libya agreed to pay at least $ 5 million to the families of each of the 270 victims
the settlement paved the way for the end of libyas nuclear weapons program and verification by international inspectors the sort of measures bolton was referring to in his cbs interview
four years after giving up his clandestine weapons program , gaddafi appeared rehabilitated as he arrived in paris for a five-day visit
said then-french president nicolas sarkozy , defending the visit against critics
