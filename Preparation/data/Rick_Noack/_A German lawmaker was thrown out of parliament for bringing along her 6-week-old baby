berlin when german legislator madeleine henfling headed into the federal state of thuringia 's parliament on wednesday , the last thing she expected was to be thrown out of the main plenary hall only a short time afterward
bringing along her 6-week-old son
i always thought that we were past that point , henfling said friday.
i do n't understand what the problem is
henfling left the plenary hall amid applause from members of the far-right alternative for germany party and of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , according to local media outlets , but her forced departure immediately caused a backlash across germany
few countries offer mothers more rights and protection than germany , but to those who came to henfling 's defense , the incident proved just how much more work there is to do to achieve full equality
the decision to temporarily eject henfling from the state parliament also stood in sharp contrast to responses in other legislative chambers where female lawmakers were praised for bringing along their babies
this summer , a canadian member of parliament was hailed as a role model after she breast-fed her baby during a debate , following an example previously set by other female legislators in argentina , australia , iceland and other countries
in new zealand 's baby-friendly parliament , the presence of newborn children has already become the norm rather than the exception
so proud that my daughter alia is the first baby to be breastfed in the federal parliament

but after henfling entered the plenary hall wednesday to participate in a vote , conservative parliamentary president christian carius swiftly dismissed her , saying that babies do n't belong in parliament
and because of the bright light and loud noises in the plenary hall , as henfling recalled friday
carius was correct that thuringia 's state parliament is n't exactly the most child-friendly one
unlike many other federal states in germany , thuringia 's parliament does not offer child-care options for mps during votes or speeches , even though they are not allowed to take maternity leave
that 's why children are allowed into plenary halls during votes in most other state parliaments or are being cared for
it really should n't be a problem , henfling said
she said she is weighing whether to complain about the decision to the state 's highest court
for now , she will ask her mother or employees to care for her baby during parliamentary votes or speeches , to avoid further disruptions of parliamentary sessions
but this is n't a sustainable solution , she said
even if thuringia 's parliamentary president eventually lifts the ban , there 's still a long way to go to meet standards now common in other countries , including iceland , where mp unnur br konrsdttir breast-fed her baby while she was addressing parliament
the mother of three explained at the time
