berlin german chancellor angela merkel and french president emmanuel macron have had their ups and downs
each has been declared the new leader of the free world since president barack obamas term ended
both are in domestic trouble
and , according to one elderly lady , they could very well be a couple
the 100-year-old woman told macron on the sidelines of a world war i commemorative event on saturday
the excited lady then turned to merkel , arguably the worlds most powerful woman
you are madame macron , the smiling centenarian said to merkel , 64 , confusing her with macrons wife , brigitte macron , who is 65 , according to frances public broadcaster and belgian television
with an unmistakably german accent , an amused merkel clarified twice in french i am the german chancellor.
its fantastic , responded the diminutive woman , whose name was not reported by french news media
in video of the encounter in rethondes , about 60 miles north of paris , a relative is heard saying the woman would turn 101 on monday

under different circumstances , mistaking a female world leader for the wife of her male counterpart would be yet another example of the persistence of gender stereotypes
but reactions to saturdays remarkable exchange were overwhelmingly positive
to a woman who was born toward the end of the first devastating world war and who was young when the germans launched the second one , the franco-german unity on display would have been completely unimaginable to her younger self
more than 20 million people were killed during world war i
only two decades later , 40 million more became victims of world war ii in europe , with half of them estimated to have been civilians
postwar divisions impacted franco-german relations early on , as more mass graves were discovered and trials uncovered the full horrors of nazi occupation
but during the second half of the 20th century , an understanding emerged between france and germany that both nations were geographically and politically tied together
that sentiment later helped establish the european union , a project originally designed to preserve peace in europe but now a far more expansive economic and political endeavor
as that union is now under unprecedented pressure from both the inside and outside , macron and merkel are seen as its most powerful protectors
on sunday , germanys far-right alternative for germany party caused a stir when it suggested that merkel should have refrained from attending the show of postwar unity in paris over the weekend because germany did not win the war
meanwhile , approval ratings for macron are dropping , as populists on the left and right gain new momentum
but both macron and merkel have struggled to confront those challengers
merkel will step down from her partys leadership in december to appease the party base , disgruntled with low poll ratings , with some expecting her resignation as german leader only months away
macrons ambitious plans to reform the e.u
have stalled amid germanys domestic woes and his own challenges at home
in eastern and central europe , strongmen such as hungarian prime minister viktor orban have taken power and , even while they benefit from e.u
funding , they constantly rail against the unions leadership
to them , merkel , macron and brussels are synonymous for a fading liberal project that has allowed too many migrants into europe and is now receding amid a popular backlash
and then , of course , there is brexit and a u.s. president who did not seem particularly moved by the show of unity that was on display over the weekend
its unclear if the merkel-macron alliance will survive intact or how long it can last
as merkel and macron held hands this weekend , some sensed not only unity but also melancholy , with merkel facing an uncertain future in german politics
the old demons , macron later said , referring to nationalism and conflict , could easily come back to wreak chaos and death.
with the memory of two world wars slowly fading and most witnesses already dead , macrons supporters say , conflicts might become more likely once again
in the case of the 100-year-old lady at least , optimism prevailed on saturday
ill be here next year , she said , addressing macron
me , too , macron responded
