how do you know that a bromance is over
quite possibly , when one side starts talking about sausage factories when referring to their recent phone conversations
when french president emmanuel macron was pressed to comment on a cnn report describing a recent call with president trump as terrible on tuesday , he did exactly that going back a century in time to come up with a rather odd analogy
calls with trump ( and other world leaders ) , he said , were essentially like sausages
macrons remarks suggest his call with trump last week may have been even more rancorous than the readouts provided by the french government and the white house in which macron is quoted as calling trumps trade tariffs illegal.
the french president said
while macrons sausage analogy on tuesday could be understood as yet another sign of his weakening ties to trump , the french president was in fact trying to make the opposite point
since assuming power , he has cracked down on leaks and adopted a more skeptical approach to the media than his predecessor , socialist president franois hollande
the content of calls with foreign leaders , macron implied , shouldnt become public
that has not been the case with a number of other trump calls to foreign leaders that have ended up leaked and offered unprecedented insights into the internal operations of d.c.s most powerful sausage factory , if one wants to stick with macrons metaphor
trump was quoted as saying by the pakistanis at the time
in july 2017 , british officials leaked the content of a phone call between british prime minister theresa may and trump in which the president reportedly made public support for him the precondition for any visit to britain and asked her to fix it.
i havent had great coverage out there lately , theresa , trump reportedly told the british leader
well , you know what the british press are like , may was said to have replied
( trumps visit to britain is now scheduled for mid-july this year )
one month later , the washington post obtained transcripts of the presidents calls with the leaders of mexico and australia
on the other hand , calls with russian leader vladimir putin later on in trumps presidency appeared to go much better , another leak revealed this march , when it was reported that trump had congratulated putin on his election victory
even though the practice isnt uncommon among world leaders , his aides had specifically urged trump not to congratulate putin , given heightened tensions between the kremlin and the united states
while commentators blasted the leaker of the transcript for violating the rules of diplomatic secrecy at the time , trumps critics immediately jumped on it as yet another opportunity to lash out at the president
if anything , these leaked transcripts of trumps phone calls seem to hint at the wisdom of macrons sausage analogy sometimes its just best not to know what is inside
