duisburg , germany in the 1950s , the relatively unknown city of duisburg was on course to become a success story
the city was a steel production center , and business was booming
duisburg grew from about 400,000 people to nearly 600,000 by the 1970s
stadiums , shopping malls and an ambitious concert hall were built for its increasingly affluent citizens
now duisburg is a symbol of postindustrial ruin
steel prices dropped in the 1970s and 1980s , thanks to a global glut of production , and more than 100,000 jobs disappeared
unemployment remains high to this day the citys biggest attraction is the iron skeleton of an abandoned steel-and-coal plant that was turned into a park and , in the marxloh district , criminal clans regularly produce national headlines
but on the other side of the world , powerful people are convinced that the citys glory days still lie ahead
duisburg has emerged as a central hub in chinas ambitious belt and road initiative , a plan to create china-friendly economic hubs along crucial transport routes in more than 60 countries
for that purpose , duisburg is perfect it boasts a massive inland port that connects roads and railway networks with the rhine , europes busiest river
the city hopes that becoming an integral part of chinas plans will persuade chinese companies to invest broadly there , result in an expansion of the port and perhaps even lead to joint research initiatives
said markus taube , a professor of east asian economic studies at the university of duisburg-essen
but chinese investment may not work out the way the city hopes
while china touts the belt and road as a new global network of easy trade and easy money , it is often criticized as a way to boost chinese companies with big contracts and tie foreign nations to beijing through commerce and debt
indeed , duisburg has so far attracted few chinese investments that go beyond logistics
and critics fear duisburg is remaking itself to become dependent on chinas economic needs rather than its own and setting itself up for another bust rather than a sustained boom
duisburg officials have sought close ties to china since the 1980s , when they formed a cultural partnership with the city of wuhan
china also was interested in the lessons being learned by duisburg and other cities in the ruhr valley , germany 's coal-and-steel heartland , as they transitioned painfully away from heavy industry
that year , chinese leader xi jinping unveiled the $ 1 trillion belt and road initiative
he subsequently announced investment deals with or loans to partner countries and cities across the globe , including duisburg
now the city is a critical part of chinas network
the goods arriving in duisburg are not only reloaded here but often also repackaged or processed , which has added more jobs than transportation hubs normally create
suessmuths company has added dozens of employees , and 40,000 jobs now depend on the port
the number of chinese companies registered in the city now around 100 also has risen sharply
the clear majority of them are connected to the logistics industry , but city officials hope that investments in high-tech enterprises and other industries will follow
said johannes pflug , duisburgs china envoy
in theory , the benefits could go beyond jobs
duisburg officials hope to turn the city into the most important german destination for chinese academics , investors and politicians
we want to become germany 's 'china city , and we 're headed the right way , said sren link , duisburg 's mayor
but if duisburg achieves that goal , it would be an outlier
experts caution that china invests in western countries for much the same reasons it does in developing ones to create financial dependencies that ensure political support and access to resources
the council on foreign relations found in a recent assessment
other developing nations , most recently malaysia , have voiced concerns about or even canceled major chinese infrastructure projects , fearing the consequences of exploding costs and risky loans and the lack of rewards for the local economy
in europe , the chinese have another objective , as well gaining access to valuable western technology
under its made in china 2025 plan , beijing hopes to reinvent itself as a high-tech juggernaut and become the global leader in at least 10 key industries , including green-energy vehicles , artificial intelligence and robotics
buying western technological know-how is part of that plan
the chinese embassy in berlin did not respond to requests for comment from the washington post
the united states , along with some other european governments , has recently used the same argument to block several chinese attempts to acquire computer-chip makers and other high-tech companies
germany announced in early august that it would change its own rules to give the government increased ability to stop controversial foreign acquisitions a move that would mostly target chinese investors
there are also political fears
a recent study by the european council on foreign relations noted that competing for chinese investments could weaken existing political blocs or partnerships , effectively allowing beijing to divide and conquer
a pentagon report released in august echoed concerns that recipients of belt and road money might shape their interests to align with chinas , and deter confrontation or criticism of chinas approach to sensitive issues.
in 2012 , for example , china launched an economic forum of 16 central and eastern european nations called the 16+1 initiative
the formation of that group has raised concerns about chinese influence on the continent , especially after hungary and greece , both 16+1 members , blocked an e.u
statement two years ago that was critical of beijings territorial claims in the south china sea
warned germanys then-foreign minister , sigmar gabriel , last year
meanwhile , skepticism also abounds about the united states , western europes longtime partner of choice
european exports to the united states have fallen for decades while asia has become a more important market
and under president trump , who has threatened the european union with tariffs , trade relations between washington and europe have grown more uncertain
what trump is doing right now is a gift to the chinese , said taube , the east asian economics professor
to them this is a competition for global hegemony , and they think what hes doing right now will strengthen them in the long run , even if it may hurt right now
concerns about trump , plus the economic realities , may lead more european leaders to eventually shelve their concerns about china
but the only body that could realistically negotiate common rules for chinese investments in europe or financial contributions to belt and road projects remains the e.u. , where a broad consensus would be needed to agree on a new strategy
and in the meantime , as its rivals move to snap up chinese largesse , duisburg plans to push along with them
