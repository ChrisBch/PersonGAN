president trump has raised doubts over a number of international u.s. friendships this year , lashing out at the european union , japan and now turkey
by imposing new tariffs on the country , trump sent its currency into free fall over the weekend
as was the case with the e.u. , trumps moves provoked a strongly worded response by the turkish government
but unlike the e.u. , turkish president recep tayyip erdogan might not be bluffing when he says that he has real alternatives to the united states
erdogan wrote in a new york times op-ed published on friday
the divide between turkey and the united states was not entirely unexpected , following years of disagreement over syria , democratic changes and economic policies
so far , western nations still account for the majority of investments in turkey
but as differences with europe and the united states have mounted , turkey has worked to boost its partnerships with other countries in recent years first and foremost russia , china and qatar
turkeys increasingly robust ties with russia were hardly a secret in washington foreign policy circles
turkey has long had more extensive links to the kremlin than other u.s. allies in the region that only recently established ties
since a failed 2016 coup attempt in turkey , erdogan has stepped up his anti-u.s. and anti-western rhetoric to rally his supporters
the turkish leader has repeatedly accused the united states of being complicit with the coup plotters accusations that coincided with improved relations with moscow
for the past two years , turkish officials have also taken part in meetings with their russian and iranian counterparts to discuss syria
the fact that the united states was left out during the talks indicated just how far the two nato members have grown apart
turkish anger over u.s. inaction to prevent a united kurdish state resulted in erdogans shift from being a staunch opponent of syrian leader bashar al-assad to his de-facto acceptance of russian support for him
cooperation on syria may soon translate into a broader partnership
after turkey suggested over the weekend that it was planning to circumvent u.s. tariffs by abandoning the dollar and trading with countries such as china or russia in other currencies , the kremlin signaled it was willing to embrace the proposal
the problem with that idea is that setting up such a mechanism wont happen overnight
and while its current dispute with the united states could make moscow an even more attractive partner for turkey , dropping their reliance on the u.s. dollar will take time
the wealthy nation in the persian gulf has long had deep ties to turkey , with a renewed official commitment to expand their relationship in 2015
some turkish troops are based in qatar and the two nations have agreed to hold joint military training exercises
turkish-qatari military ties have been viewed with growing suspicion by other nations in the region and their suspension was a core demand by a coalition of arab countries that launched a blockade of qatar last year
the ongoing blockade has so far achieved the opposite , however
qatar has in return expanded investments in turkey
but with qatar battling its own crisis , its unclear how much the tiny gulf nation will be able to help its troubled friend out
at first glimpse , china doesnt appear to be an ideal partner for the predominantly muslim turkey , given beijings repression of the muslim uighur minority
but china is promising turkey what it long unsuccessfully sought with the west
turkeys efforts to enter the e.u
never really progressed , but china has indicated that turkey may eventually be able to join its own e.u
alternative , the shanghai cooperation organization
last week , turkey and china announced expanded military ties at a time when the future of nato is less certain than ever
beijing has been eager to fill the global power vacuum left by the united states , especially after trump pulled out of trade agreements or raised questions over the future of nato
as turkey is seeking even closer ties to china , the feeling appears to be mutual.
if turkey fails , it brings the world down with it , asia analyst phar kim beng wrote in a recent piece for the south china morning post
