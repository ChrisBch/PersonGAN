secretary of state mike pompeo arrived in riyadh early tuesday for talks with saudi officials , including king salman and crown prince mohammed bin salman
the visit comes as the united states and other nations are demanding answers on the disappearance of saudi washington post contributor jamal khashoggi on oct. 2
he was last seen entering the saudi consulate in istanbul
while saudi arabia has so far denied any involvement , turkish authorities believe that the prominent writer who was living in exile in the united states was killed inside the consulate
trump has given pompeo license to travel anywhere he deems necessary to reach a conclusion on the writers fate , but there is no lack of pressing issues to justify pompeo staying in riyadh a bit longer than planned
heres a list of only some of the unanswered questions for the saudi leadership
what happened to jamal khashoggi
despite king salmans reassurances , the kingdom is under growing pressure to explain how khashoggi disappeared inside its consulate and whether he was killed
are you serious about this investigation
there are reasons to doubt that the saudis are serious about their offered cooperation with turkish investigators , including an especially bizarre moment on monday
hours before turkish investigators were for the first time allowed to search the saudi premises , a cleaning crew arrived at the consulates door as journalists from all over the world were watching
if confirmed , how do you explain that khashoggis death is the result of a botched operation
after two weeks of denials , any explanation that khashoggi was accidentally killed would probably be seen as a halfhearted coverup in the united states and europe
was the lebanese prime ministers strange resignation last year the result of another such saudi operation
last november , lebanese prime minister saad hariri surprisingly resigned during a stay in saudi arabia , which immediately sparked speculations over his freedom of movement
hariri later put his resignation on hold and returned to lebanon
others whom the saudi leadership had issues with never made it back to their countries of residence
what happened to other saudi activists critical of your leadership
as my colleague amanda erickson summarized , khashoggi is only the latest saudi critic to mysteriously disappear
at least three other europe-based saudi nationals have been kidnapped since 2014
their fate is uncertain
do you still want to turn qatar into an island
saudi arabias regional foe , qatar , on monday demanded the release of others believed to be held by the saudis
the demands put a renewed spotlight on the ongoing saudi-led blockade of qatar , which has sparked speculations about saudi plans to turn qatar into an island by constructing a canal
that project would reportedly cost $ 750 million , according to agence france-presse
what are you doing to prevent the worst famine in the world in 100 years , which you are also responsible for
the united states and britain are the biggest arms exporters to saudi arabia , which has used their weapons systems and fighter jets to engage in a devastating war in neighboring yemen
saudi arabia stands accused of targeting civilians , according to a recent human rights watch report that concluded that the involvement may have resulted in war crimes.
with more than 13 million people at risk of starvation , the saudi-led coalition is being criticized for its role in creating the potentially worst famine in the world in 100 years.
preventing that famine would cost about $ 2.1 billion , or about three times the reported costs of turning qatar into an island
when are you planning to release the female activists youve detained
saudi arabia has arrested a number of prominent female human rights activists in recent months
two of them , samar badawi and nassima al-sada , were placed under a travel ban in august , according to amnesty international , which called the measures part of an unprecedented level of persecution of human rights defenders in saudi arabia.
were the canadians right about you
but with the united states , britain and france being direct suppliers of the arms used in that conflict , saudi arabia has faced only little high-level criticism from western nations
one prominent exception is canada
