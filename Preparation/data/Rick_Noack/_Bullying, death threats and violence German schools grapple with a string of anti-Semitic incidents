berlin should i tell my students
jewish teachers in germanys public schools are grappling with the question of whether it is safe and appropriate to reveal their identity amid a rise in anti-semitic incidents in the nations schools
she said , referring to the students anti-semitic remarks in the past
she is scared of someone in the classroom eventually finding out how much such comments affect her
anti-semitism still or once again poses a challenge to the over 200,000 jews who are estimated to live in germany
while police statistics suggest that anti-semitic incidents have occurred at a similar rate across the country for years , incidents have mounted in some cities , including in germanys capital berlin
according to numbers released by german authorities on wednesday , numbers surged by more than 10 percent year-on-year and a fifth of anti-semitic hate crimes in germany a category that includes violent or verbal attacks are now committed in berlin
while some of the increases may be due to changed reporting mechanisms , authorities view the numbers as a cause for concern
right-wing extremists were responsible for the vast majority of incidents , followed by attackers with foreign ideologies a phrase that often refers to the influx of immigrants from muslim countries that have arrived in recent years
researchers , however , caution against pinning the phenomenon exclusively on these new arrivals
recent fears over a resurgence of traditional anti-semitic patterns across europe have also triggered a heightened awareness of the problem in germany in general and in schools in particular , following several cases in which jewish students were bullied or even assaulted
yet despite this growing sense of urgency , teachers are still not routinely trained on how to respond to anti-semitic remarks in schools
at a recent private workshop for teachers who find themselves confronted with anti-semitic remarks against their students or themselves , organized by the berlin-based competence-center for prevention and empowerment , both schwartze and furer recalled incidents they would classify as anti-semitic
furer mentioned an israeli flag that was torn down from posters in the school corridor
schwartze remembered a students questions whether the fate of jews in nazi concentration camps could be compared to the situation faced by of palestinians today or why jews are exempt from paying taxes in germany a claim that is false
said berlins official in charge of anti-discrimination efforts , saraya gomis
few studies exist on the origins of their beliefs , but anecdotal evidence suggest students often repeat stereotypes in the media , at home , or among peers
anti-semitism watchdogs fear that without a comprehensive governmental response , schools could be educating a generation of young people who subscribe to stereotypes
germanys american jewish committee ( ajc ) is collaborating with the regional government in berlin to better understand the extent of the problem and possible solutions , in a project that is set to be expanded to other parts of the country
acknowledged deidre berger , ajcs berlin director
conspiracy theories , berger said , were increasingly prevalent and teachers lacked adequate training or knowledge on how to debunk them , according to the ajcs initial findings
said juliane wetzel , a researcher at the center for research on anti-semitism technical university of berlin
although no representative studies exist , in initial interviews wetzel has found that most refugees are eager to integrate into german culture and learn about the countrys history and values
merkel said in a tv interview earlier this year.
but unfortunately , anti-semitism existed before this , merkel acknowledged , referring to right-wing attacks or more widespread stereotypes
but it was the public focus on immigrants that triggered an unprecedented national awareness for a problem teachers themselves have long struggled with
teachers felt left alone with the problems , said berger
the problem is amplified by germanys federalized education system that gives the countrys 16 regional state governments authority over their own schools , and has in part prevented a coordinated national response
said schwartze , who teaches in frankfurt.
you have to discuss it with them.
salaam-shalom coordinator armin langer told berlins tagesspiegel daily
tackling anti-semitism primarily as a problem between jews and muslims in major hubs like berlin , however , ignores that anti-semitism is a far broader concern , critics warn
singling out one group to discuss a more widespread issue , said berlins gomis , may trigger racism and in turn more anti-semitism
