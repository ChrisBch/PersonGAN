tallinn , estonia the waters of tallinn bay off the shore of estonias capital are usually teeming with boats
but on a recent summer day , the boats stayed huddled near shore as a military diver slipped beneath the surface of the bay
after a 90-second descent through opaque green water , chief petty officer 2nd class imre alljrv halted next to a tubular black object a world war ii-era mine containing enough explosives to sink one of the cruise ships that frequently pass by
he placed explosive charges of his own around the mine , then headed back up toward the sunlight
a few minutes later , alljrv set off his charges , turning the mine into a plume of water , sediment and metal that rocketed into the air and released a pungent smell
one down , 80,000 or so to go
mines and bombs from world war ii also litter other bodies of water , including the north sea and the mediterranean sea
but the only european states that have systematically attempted to clear the rusting weapons are those around the baltic
after world war ii , the allies decided to dump 300,000 metric tons of munitions into the ocean , which appeared to be the safest and most easily accessible disposal ground
but some of the weapons including land mines containing mustard gas were simply dropped into the baltic and north seas rather than being taken to faraway dump sites
the result is a particularly dangerous stretch of water
three dutch fishermen were killed in 2005 after they accidentally reeled in a world war ii american bomb , which then exploded
in august , 2,000 people were evacuated from the polish resort city of kolobrzeg after three bombs were discovered in the nearby bay
and throughout the baltic sea , fishermen are banned from accessing waters where the density of mines is so high that clearing the seabed is too expensive
the waters near baltic ports were especially common targets during the war and still pose the biggest risks today
many mines are too close to shore to be destroyed on the spot authorities must move them farther away , a dangerous prospect , before they can be detonated
no area of the baltic is more heavily mined than the waters near tallinn
during world war ii , the city was the gateway to st. petersburg then called leningrad and the soviet unions baltic fleet
the estonian government estimates that there are up to 50,000 mines hidden in the seabed nearby
said 2nd lt. karl baumeister , a navy spokesman
by his estimate , he has defused about 50 mines in his 13 years on the job
the estonian navy also has remote-controlled vehicles that can investigate and detonate mines
but alljrv prefers to head to the bottom himself , even though conditions in the baltic sea are rarely ideal
visibility is sometimes no more than a few inches , especially as the sea heats up during the summer.
usually we work as if we were blindfolded , alljrv said
even though the mines remain a potentially fatal threat , dealing with them daily has helped him shake off some of his initial fears.
im not really nervous anymore
i actually think theyre exciting , alljrv said
others share his enthusiasm
during an annual countermining operation that brings together many baltic and western european navies , theres an unofficial competition to see who can clear the most ordnance from the water
these days , baumeister said , the germans are usually winning
