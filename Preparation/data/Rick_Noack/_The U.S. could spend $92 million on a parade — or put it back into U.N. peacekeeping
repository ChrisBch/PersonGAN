after president trump announced his intention to host a military parade in washington this year , critics compared the plans to the dreams of a despot , complained that the extravaganza was too focused on trump himself and questioned the costs of any such endeavor
on friday morning , trump tweeted that he has canceled the parade for this year amid spiraling costs but indicated that it was potentially still on for 2019 , if costs go down.
now we can buy some more jet fighters , he wrote
the local politicians who run washington , d.c. ( poorly ) know a windfall when they see it
when asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade , they wanted a number so ridiculously high that i cancelled it
never let someone hold you up
i will instead ...
... .attend the big parade already scheduled at andrews air force base on a different date , & go to the paris parade , celebrating the end of the war , on november 11th
maybe we will do something next year in d.c. when the cost comes way down
now we can buy some more jet fighters
the associated press previously reported that a parade in washington would have cost $ 92 million , or three times as much as initially predicted by the trump administration
if such a parade or a somewhat smaller version of it were to be held next year , what sort of message would it send
one year ago , u.s
ambassador to the united nations nikki haley announced cuts of roughly $ 570 million to the u.n. peacekeeping budget of which the united states would have shouldered 28 percent , or $ 160 million
this year , the budget decreased further as some missions were shuttered , with the united states again saving about the same amount as last year
this is part of a general reduction in u.s. expenditures abroad , including a call to slash the foreign aid budget by a third , which was later thwarted by congress
now my colleagues report that the trump administration is using other means to take back more than $ 3 billion in already approved foreign aid in an effort to curb such spending
the problem is , experts , including many former military officers , are pretty sure that money spent on diplomacy and international institutions saves u.s. lives in the long run
so rather than hold that parade , would the money be better spent if it were used to restore some of that slashed funding for u.n. peacekeeping missions that almost invariably use non-american troops
the united states has decreased its annual u.n. peacekeeping contributions by almost $ 300 million since trump took office
roughly a third of those savings would have been spent on trumps parade instead ( though of course the money comes from different departments )
defending his parade , trump has argued that the veterans day event would honor the millions of u.s. service members who have risked their lives for the country
the cuts to the united nations , meanwhile , are justified on the grounds that the missions are vastly overfunded
haley said last year
but in reality , u.s. cuts have already resulted in peacekeeping missions being scaled back
despite recurrent violence , the united nations darfur mission has been cut significantly and could be closed down entirely
similar measures were imposed in the democratic republic of congo , where the humanitarian situation has worsened since
most critics of trumps military parade argue that theres certainly nothing wrong with honoring u.s. soldiers
but such plans seem a bit incongruous as the united states is slashing budgets that contribute to greater security around the globe without risking american lives
in 2017 , more peacekeepers lost their lives than at any other point of time in the past two decades
jean-pierre lacroix , undersecretary-general for the u.n. 's peacekeeping operations , said in july
a common but false assumption about u.n. peacekeeping funding is that the united states can simply reduce its contribution share unilaterally
in fact , it has an obligation to fund 28 percent of peacekeeping costs a ratio set by a committee and based on economic strength and security council membership
to reduce expenditure without violating those obligations , the overall budget must be reduced
in other words , by reducing its own costs , the united states has caused a ripple effect that has allowed china , russia and all other nations to also spend less on missions securing peace
aditi gorur , director of the nonpartisan protecting civilians in conflict program at the stimson center , told voice of america last year when the cuts were first announced
the u.n. peacekeeping system is far from perfect , which is why officials have launched a number of initiatives to stop abuse and sexual exploitation committed by u.n. peacekeepers
but in many cases , u.n. peacekeepers are doing jobs in conflict zones where the united states would otherwise have been under pressure to put boots on the ground
the united nations only contributes $ 1,428 per month and soldier out of its budget
thats a lot in india
compared to what deploying u.s. troops would cost , its still a bargain and ultimately might be more useful than a parade
