berlin under socialist control , the eastern german city of chemnitz used to carry the name karl marx city in tribute to the communist icon
over the past two days , however , the city of 240,000 has been in the news because of riots led by xenophobic groups that subscribe to a far-right , anti-immigrant ideology
the violence , which brought condemnation from chancellor angela merkel , erupted after a 35-year-old man was fatally stabbed sunday in chemnitz during what officials called a dispute between several people of different nationalities.
one syrian and an iraqi national were detained
amid protests over the death , right-wing mobs hunted and attacked foreigners , injuring several people
at least six others were injured monday after far-right groups , neo-nazis and left-wing protesters clashed in the city , using fireworks and glass bottles as weapons
authorities said tuesday that they were investigating 10 protesters accused of giving the hitler salute , which is banned in germany
in the federal state of saxony where chemnitz is located the far-right alternative for germany ( afd ) party ranks second in the polls , with merkels governing christian democratic union ( cdu ) only five percentage points ahead
whereas merkels initially welcoming stance toward refugees did not significantly hurt the cdus ratings in many western german federal states with higher migrant populations , saxonys far-right position has been more successful in capitalizing on immigration fears
researchers think the strong performance of right-wing populists and the deep entrenchment of neo-nazi groups in the state are linked to xenophobic violence , even though the afds leadership has distanced itself from the weekend incidents
saxony has been among the german states with the most violent attacks on refugees and other foreigners for years , with almost 100 incidents last year , according to state security services
the afd again was accused of helping to incite the violence monday after one of its lawmakers tweeted that people will go on the streets and protect themselves if authorities fail to do so
as local officials struggled to explain why authorities had failed to prevent the violence for the second day in a row , the german government issued a sharp condemnation from berlin
said steffen seibert , merkels spokesman
saxonys conservative minister-president , michael kretschmer , defended regional authorities tuesday but also decried the far-right , calling its political exploitation of the 35-year-olds killing disgusting.
