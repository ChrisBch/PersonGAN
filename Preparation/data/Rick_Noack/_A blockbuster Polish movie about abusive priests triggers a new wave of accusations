warsaw in a country where nearly nine in 10 people identify as catholic , a movie thats sharply critical of the catholic church might seem like a hard sell
but a black comedy called kler ( polish for clergy ) has become a blockbuster hit in poland , drawing more than 4 million people to cinemas and becoming the third-most successful film here since the end of communism
the movie follows three fictional catholic priests , who are depicted as alcoholics , pedophiles and criminals protected by a powerful church hierarchy that considers itself above the law.
kler shows priests participating in drinking games and having sex with women
they commit fraud , silence opponents and have connections to far-right groups
the film also deals with sexual abuse by priests , scenes that are based on testimony from real-life victims
its release has prompted a new wave of victims to step forward
said marek lisinski , an abuse survivor who is now the head of polands biggest victims organization
their influence is finally eroding now , we hope.
lisinskis organization , called do not fear , has received thousands of calls and letters since kler premiered in late september
the group said it has heard from more potential victims in that time than it had in the past five years combined
of those people , about 200 have made accusations the group deems credible and sufficiently detailed
with the ruling law and justice party openly strengthening its ties to the clergy , some liberal opposition members hope curbing the churchs powers will become a campaign issue during the next general election
supporters of the church have not taken the criticism without a fight they called for a boycott of kler , joined by some cinemas and a catholic media organization , saying it is anti-catholic
members of the law and justice party have also lashed out at the filmmakers
said pawel rytel-andrianik , a spokesman for the polish bishops conference , who emphasized bishops are extremely committed to preventing sexual abuse
the church in poland has commissioned a study to examine the extent of abuse by priests and updated its own internal rules , which it says are more expansive than polish civil law
it also favors a national commission to address the sexual abuse of children , a move do not fear also supports
other than that , however , there is little overlap between the demands of secular victims groups and the church
one key question is whether the catholic church itself can be blamed for complicity in sexual abuse
shortly afterward , he jumped up from his chair to take a call
this happens all the time , said agata diduszko , a warsaw city councilor , who was sitting next to lisinski and has worked closely with him since the release of the movie.
marek has this rule to always answer his phone when a new victim calls
if you dont immediately respond to them , said added , they might never have the courage to call again.
