in a country that hasnt been at war for more than 200 years , preparing for the worst means going back to the basics
good hand hygiene is important for avoiding infection , cautions a new leaflet that is due to be distributed to all 4.8 million swedish households by the government in stockholm in an effort to increase the nations war and crisis readiness
next to a drawing that depicts fighter jets and tanks in the picturesque and historically peaceful swedish landscape , the authors urge their readers to take the advice seriously
they assert ( and dont be fooled by any fake news reports to the contrary )
some years ago , the campaign may have been laughed off as a taxpayer-financed 20-page guide for preppers gun-toting , bunker-building survivalists always preparing for the end of days
these days , however , there isnt much ridicule
while experts estimate it would take a week to fully mobilize the swedish military , other scenarios predict russia could invade europe within only two days
russia has been accused of several risky military maneuvers near or inside swedish airspace during the past few years , raising concerns over an accidental or deliberate escalation of tensions
sweden has 20,000 active military members while russia has over a million , and the swedes would be unlikely to win any confrontation with moscow
stockholm also isnt a member of nato , the military alliance that obliges members to help defend member states in case of an attack
instead , sweden is circling back to its cold war-era strategy of total defense , which relies on all citizens resisting an invasion and refusing to cooperate with any foreign powers
to remind the swedes of their responsibility , the swedish government is also launching advertisements in media outlets this week , ahead of the large-scale distribution of the pamphlets starting next week
it is the first such campaign in over half a century
during world war ii , sweden produced similar pamphlets and continued issuing updates for several more decades
but eventually even the production of a more downsized version targeting just politicians and local authorities was stopped , as political scientists proclaimed the end of history and the victory of democracy in the early 1990s
to prepare its citizens for this new world , the guide under the title if crisis or war comes was designed to be accessible to citizens and residents with varying language skills , both in swedish and english
it comes with illustrations showing swedes fending off foreign powers or responding to catastrophes , as well as lists of essential food or advice on how to deal with a broken toilet
sweden is one of the richest nations in the world , which may be why the authors go to great lengths to describe the impact of war or crisis in as much detail as possible
in just a short time , your everyday life can become problematic
the heating stops working
it becomes difficult to prepare and store food
the shops may run out of food and other goods
there is no water coming from the taps or the toilet
it is not possible to fill up your car
payment cards and cash machines do not work
mobile networks and the internet do not work
public transport and other means of transport are at a standstill
it becomes difficult to obtain medicines and medical equipment.
which could possibly be a reference to russian president vladimir putins authoritarian rule over russia and his annexed territories
sweden fears that russia may seek to expand its sphere of influence further into europe
besides russia , sweden has also been among europes most outspoken critics of the trump administrations threats against north korea or iran , arguing that the white house is risking an unnecessary escalation
the country has shown a similar lack of understanding for trumps early reluctance to directly confront russia over its efforts to interfere with western elections
the leaflet explains , referring to predominantly russian disinformation campaigns ahead of this falls swedish elections

swedens war guide has you covered , too
