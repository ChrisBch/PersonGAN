london the british government warned wednesday of repercussions after the united arab emirates sentenced a british academic to life in prison on accusations of spying
matthew hedges , a 31-year-old student at durham university in northern england , was arrested may 5 at the dubai international airport after a two-week trip to the country
the university and his family say he was researching emirati security and foreign policy for his phd thesis
last month , uae authorities charged hedges with espionage

a judge handed down the sentence during a five-minute court session wednesday in abu dhabi
british foreign secretary jeremy hunt said in a statement
he said he raised the case with uae authorities during a trip to abu dhabi last week
the uae is britains fourth-largest export market outside the european union , and british officials have been working to strengthen those ties as their country prepares to leave the e.u
in march and negotiate new bilateral trade deals
for months , hedgess family members refrained from speaking out
british government officials advised that keeping the case out of the press would ease his sentence

british consular officials were believed to have monitored wednesdays court session in abu dhabi
hedges was unexpectedly released on bail last month after four months in solitary confinement
family members said his health had deteriorated and that he had been vomiting daily , after prison authorities supplied him with a cocktail of antidepressants , anti-anxiety medicine and sleeping pills
british prime minister theresa may told parliament on wednesday that she was deeply disappointed and concerned at todays verdict and would raise the case with uae authorities at the highest level.

the university said
said ulrichsen , who has also advised hedgess family since he was first detained
he said that the effect on the countrys reputation as a safe place to work could be profound
