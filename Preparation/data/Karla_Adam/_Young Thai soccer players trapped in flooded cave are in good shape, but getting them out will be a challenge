divers who braved murky water and strong currents found the soccer team monday on a dry ledge more than a mile from the mouth of the cave
the team remained there tuesday , no longer alone and with food , water and medicine , as authorities tried to figure out how to extract them safely
this is the season of the monsoon , with two inches of rain forecast to fall through sunday
the monsoon lasts until the end of summer
the water in the cave is expected to rise
the boys and their coach are not in danger of drowning
but the floodwaters cut off their path of escape
none of the boys can swim
officials are considering giving the entire group a crash course in cave diving so that they can swim through flooded passages
the joyous news that the soccer team was found alive has been coupled with vexation over what to do next
a thousand people at least are involved in the rescue effort , with help coming from around the globe , but technology is struggling to overcome the geology of the tham luang cave complex
there is no simple way to save the trapped team
engineers have drained water from portions of the cave , but it is a vast subterranean cavern fed by a broad watershed
there is no sign that the efforts have lowered water levels to a point that would allow an extraction on foot
officials said tuesday they might try to bring some of the boys out within a matter of hours , but they also said they do not want to take unnecessary risks
at one point tuesday , officials suggested that the rescue could take months
the governor of chiang rai province , narongsak osoththanakorn , told reporters , according to the bbc
the boys range in age from 11 to 16 , and are with their 25-year-old coach
they went missing on june 23 while exploring the six-mile-long cave , which is in a park in northern thailand near the myanmar border
the worlds attention has been riveted to their story , which echoes the tale of the 33 chilean miners who were trapped for 69 days nearly half a mile below the surface in 2010
engineers there eventually drilled a vertical hole to reach their chamber , and all the miners were pulled to the surface one by one while a global audience watched on live television
the members of the thai soccer team were discovered monday by two british divers , rick stanton and john volanthen
in a video posted by the thai navy on its facebook page , the boys are seen huddled on a rock in mud-stained t-shirts and shorts surrounded by water
when one of the boys asked if they could leave the cave , the rescuers replied that they couldnt yet but that many people were coming for them
navy seal will come tomorrow , with food and doctors and everything , the rescuer said
the british divers described their three-hour round-trip into the cave as challenging because of the murkiness of the water
the rescuers had to fight a current as they pulled themselves through narrow , flooded passages by gripping the walls
meet the british a-team divers at the center of thailand cave rescue
members of the british cave-diving community say that stanton and volanthen have been involved in a number of high-profile rescues
thai authorities called on them to help
he said , referring to the current
the last thing you want is any adrenaline whatsoever.
a limestone cave complex is like a giant sponge , said amy frappier , a professor of geosciences at skidmore college who has done extensive research in caves
she said that when the water table is low , you can walk throughout the complex , but then the air holes fill up as the water table rises after heavy rains
that appears to be what happened here the boys and their coach walked into the cave , and then the rain came
they could not go back the way they had come because they would have had to swim through flooded passages
a boys soccer team trapped in a flooded thai cave has been found alive nine days later
options for extracting the soccer team include drilling from the surface to create another exit
but experts have warned that this could take a long time
the boys and the coach are no longer alone
theyve been visited by a doctor and a nurse who accompanied five other divers , and theyve been given high-protein liquid food , thai navy seal commander rear adm. arpakorn yookongkaew said , according to the associated press
the boys are being entertained , and a phone line is being installed to permit them to speak with their families , the bbc reported
to make sure its 100 percent safe , the ap reported
khaosod english , a bangkok-based news organization , reported that officials are calling for donations of small diving masks that would fit the boys , as regular diving equipment could be too dangerous
officials say they have performed an informal medical evaluation and determined that most of the boys are in stable condition
no one has any critical injuries , said chiang rais governor
the boys and their coach did not know what day it was when the divers found them
