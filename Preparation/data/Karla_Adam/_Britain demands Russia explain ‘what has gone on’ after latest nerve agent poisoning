the couple in the latest incident was exposed to the novichok nerve agent after handling a contaminated item , the metropolitan police said in a statement thursday evening
investigators are trying to determine whether this was residual contamination from the march attack , when sergei skripal and his adult daughter , yulia , were poisoned just eight miles away
british authorities linked that attack to the russian government
moscow denied any involvement
britains security minister , ben wallace , told the bbc that the working assumption is that the british pair sickened in the town of amesbury on saturday was not directly targeted
british officials say the pair may have come into contact with nerve agent at a location not covered in the skripal decontamination sites
health officials alternatively could have failed to eliminate exposure risks during their extensive cleanup
another , more troubling , scenario would be that the pair was exposed to a different batch of novichok
witnesses told british media that the couple identified as charlie rowley , 45 , and dawn sturgess , 44 were frothing at the mouth and incoherent before becoming comatose
they are in critical condition at salisbury district hospital , the same hospital where the skripals received care
sajid javid , britains home secretary , told parliament on thursday , adding that it was also unacceptable for british streets or parks to be dumping grounds for poison.
two more victims of soviet-era nerve agent poisoned in british town
russia hit back , urging britain to avoid playing politics
maria zakharova , russias foreign ministry spokeswoman , told reporters in moscow that britain should avoid dirty political games and should instead cooperate with russian law enforcement
the russian embassy in london had called for a joint investigation into the salisbury incident
the latest incident threatens to further damage british-russian relations , which are already in a deep freeze after the skirpal poisonings
britain condemned that attack as a hostile act by russia and went on to expel 23 russian diplomats
at least 26 other countries joined in retaliatory measures by also expelling russian diplomats
british government officials and members of the royal family have also boycotted the world cup in russia
he said that an assailant could have discarded the novichok residue four months ago in the park in salisbury or in the nearby river , which is running low
health officials have insisted that the risk to the wider public is low
they have advised as a highly precautionary measure that those who visited the sites that rowley and sturgess went to on friday and saturday wash their clothes and wipe down personal belongings such as phones and handbags
they also urged locals not to pick up any unknown items
