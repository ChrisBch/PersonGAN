london the leaders of france and britain used phrases such as red line and horrific suffering on saturday to defend their decisions to join the u.s.-led strike against syria for its suspected chemical attack
france and britain stressed that their military response was limited , successful and not designed to topple the regime of president bashar al-assad
the goal at home , meanwhile , was to soften the political fallout amid questions and clamor about taking part in the military action led by president trump
the moves by british prime minister theresa may and french president emmanuel macron are unlikely to pose direct threats to the stability of their governments
but the reaction to the allies coordinated attacks in syria is playing out differently in europe than in the united states
in britain , it was an open question how much did the public support mays decision to bomb syrian targets
many britons are still upset about then-prime minister tony blairs decision to join president george w. bush in the iraq war , claiming that the country was misled and that the results were disastrous
in france , macron has a similar uphill climb to win over a public highly cautious about getting too involved in another crisis in the middle east as the memory of a libyan operation in 2011 still looms large
french forces , along with nato allies , helped topple the regime of dictator moammar gaddafi but ultimately entered a conflict that dragged on for months longer than anticipated
in russia , harsh words but no retaliation
may said during a news conference at 10 downing street
referring to the syrian regime , she said we are also clear about who was responsible for this atrocity.
yet her opponents pounced sensing a deep skepticism in britain about whether military action was the right course , or a feeling that may did not go about it in the preferred way
vince cable , the leader of the liberal democrats , didnt rule out supporting military action if a case were made but said that may was wrong not to seek parliamentary consent
she added uk foreign policy should be set by parliament , not us president.
may is not required by law to win approval from lawmakers before committing britain to military action
but the convention in britain is that lawmakers be given a chance to vote
parliament is in recess until monday , but she could have called an emergency session
it is unclear how such a vote in parliament would have turned out
the iraq war casts a long shadow over politics in britain , and some lawmakers are wary about the effectiveness of military action on its own
in 2013 , david cameron , then the prime minister , lost a vote in parliament that was designed to pave the way for airstrikes against the assad regime
two years later , he won a vote for britain to join the u.s.-led bombing campaign that targeted the islamic state in syria
in france , macron faced a skeptical public , but one that was willing to give him some leeway
franois heisbourg , a security analyst and former presidential national security adviser , said in an interview
macron , who has long considered the use of chemical weapons in syria a red line , was clear to underscore what he presented as frances moral obligation to intervene
he said in a statement saturday
according to french defense officials , 12 french missiles were fired in total
british defense minister gavin williamson said four royal air force tornado gr4 jets took part in the strikes
he told bbc radio that initial assessments suggested that it was a highly successful mission.
in the days leading up to the strikes , opinion polls suggested that the french public was skeptical about the prospect of an attack
but former president franois hollande and benot hamon , the socialist presidential contender last year , came to macrons defense in the past week , urging an end to humanitarian abuse in syria
the loudest opposition in france was ultimately confined to the political extremes , factions with little clout in parliament
marine le pen , the leader of the far-right national front , said much the same
macron and florence parly , frances defense minister , emphasized the limited scope of the strikes
