berlin his affiliations were a roll call of institutions whose very names suggest power , influence and global reach the london academy of diplomacy , the london center of international law practice , the euro-mediterranean university
his titles had a loftiness to match president , director , and according to his online biography , founding father of the term 'academic diplomacy
but in the plea agreement unsealed last week as part of special counsel robert s. mueller iii 's investigation into russian influence on last year 's u.s. presidential election , he is simply and mysteriously the professor
joseph mifsud , the man who , according to court papers , offered himself as a bridge between the trump campaign and the highest echelons of the kremlin , has spent his career trading one impressive-looking business card for the next
who is george papadopoulos , the trump adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators
to george papadopoulos , the trump foreign policy aide who liaised with mifsud , the maltese academic may have appeared to be just the sort of man needed to cut through the impenetrable fog of moscow power structures
but a review of mifsud 's credentials and connections reveals plenty of fog there , as well
at the scottish university where he was a professor , he was seldom if ever seen by fellow faculty or students
at the slovenian university where he was president , he left amid a swirl of accusations of financial impropriety , including a cellphone bill that topped $ 1,000 a month
and at the london law center where he served as an adviser , others named as part of the firm 's team were shocked this week to learn of the association
seriously , i work there
does anyone else work there
said gary born , a specialist in international arbitration who was surprised to hear when reached by a washington post reporter that his picture and biography were on the london center of international law practice 's website
whether there is much more to mifsud than meets the eye or perhaps much less will now be a question for mueller
in the plea agreement , papadopoulos depicts mifsud as a contact eager to help play matchmaker between the trump team and president vladimir putin 's inner circle
the plea agreement makes no direct accusation against mifsud
but a sworn affidavit from fbi special agent robert gibbs at least raises the possibility he was a russian cutout
the russian government and its intelligence and security services frequently make use of non-governmental intermediaries to achieve their foreign intelligence objectives , gibbs writes
this structure serves in part to hide the overt involvement of the russian government
russia , he continues , has used individuals associated with academia and think tanks in such a capacity
mifsud last week insisted he was not a secret agent
i never got any money from the russians
professor at center of russia disclosures claimed to have met with putin
but on other points he has been contradictory
when the indictment was unsealed on monday , he initially denied that he was the professor cited in the court papers
then on tuesday he confirmed it , but told london 's daily telegraph that the descriptions of his role were exaggerated and insisted he had had no contact with russian officials
but the same day , the post reported that he had boasted to his former assistant late last year that he had had a meeting with putin
on wednesday , he told italy 's la repubblica that papadopoulos 's claims about him in the indictment were nonsense
i strongly deny any discussion about secrets concerning hillary clinton , he said
i swear it on my daughter
but then , minutes later , he related that he had been in moscow during the presidential campaign and had had a conversation with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov
he also said he was in touch with officials at russian think tanks that are considered close to the kremlin and the foreign ministry
as for the alleged niece of putin , mifsud laughed off the suggestion that she was related to the russian president
she 's just a student , he said
a very good-looking one
mifsud also told la repubblica that he had been speaking with the fbi
mifsud has not responded to calls or emails from the post
to former colleagues in his native malta , mifsud 's sudden entrance into the center of the world 's most-watched investigation is a surprise
but not a total one
he 's a charmer , said dominic fenech , a dean at the university of malta
mifsud was once a lecturer in education at the university
but fenech and other colleagues said his interest in the normal preoccupations of academics research , publishing and teaching was minimal
paul manaforts lavish lifestyle highlighted in indictment
instead , fenech said , mifsud was more focused on creating international educational partnerships
one was a for-profit branch of the university of malta that mifsud helped to establish in rome with a senior italian politician who had been implicated in a series of scandals
the university later withdrew its participation
another was the european union-funded euro-mediterranean university in slovenia
fenech , a scholar of mediterranean history , said the school had little to no academic profile
to me , frankly , people who get these jobs in these kinds of institutions , well , it often makes me wonder , he said
i 'm not saying he 's wheeling and dealing
i 'm just saying everything 's possible
mifsud left the university under a cloud , with slovenian government ministers expressing disappointment at the institution 's progress and officials claiming that mifsud had left behind tens of thousands of euros worth of unexplained expenses
mifsud told the times of malta when the claims came to light in 2013 that it was a private matter
the university released a statement this week saying its relationship with mifsud was completely severed since he has resigned from his post as president of the university in july 2012
in fact , the statement continued , following his resignation , the university was unaware of the whereabouts of mr
his whereabouts were mostly in london , though exactly what he was doing there is difficult to pin down
his roles included professorships at the university of stirling in scotland and the university of east anglia both of which were associated with the london academy of diplomacy , where mifsud was honorary director
andrew glencross , a politics expert who taught at stirling between 2013 and 2016 , described mifsud as personable , congenial and an inveterate name dropper in terms of politicians
but mifsud was not a typical professor
the university 's student newspaper reported last week that mifsud had no office on campus , and it could not find any students who had met him
he 's not your run-of-the-mill professor with a large hinterland of research , of teaching , of supervising research students , grant applications
that was why , from the first instance i was aware of the collaboration with the london academy of diplomacy i was perplexed about who exactly they were and what they brought to us
when the university announced the association in 2014 , glencross said he and his colleagues had never heard of the organization
they were n't on the radar
equally perplexing was the london center of international law practice
the center supposedly operates from a fine georgian building overlooking a leafy london square
when a post reporter buzzed the door on several occasions during business hours last week , no one answered
until recently , the staff web page had 33 people listed on it , including joseph mifsud
but the page was deleted on oct. 23 , a week before the papadopoulos plea agreement was unsealed
several of those listed as being part of the team were only loosely affiliated if at all
born , the arbitration specialist whose name was listed on the site , said he met once with one of its employees , who pitched him on a forum for academic and public policy discussions
it was pretty vague and aspirational
as far as born knew , nothing came of it
another person connected to the center was papadopoulos , who worked there in the spring of 2016 under the lofty title of director of the center for international energy and natural resources law & security
it 's unclear whether the center explains how the young papadopoulos and the middle-aged mifsud first connected
but glencross , the political analyst , speculated that whenever they met , they probably saw in each other kindred spirits
mifsud is exactly the type of person who is on the make , or wants to be on the make in foreign policy circles , he said
i can see why someone like papadopoulos , if he wanted to make himself seem more important , he would want to latch on to someone like joseph
