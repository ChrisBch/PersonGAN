paris across europe , the deadly truck attack in lower manhattan seemed instantly familiar , the latest in a long string of similar vehicle-as-weapon strikes that have left authorities struggling over ways to balance increased security and the traditional free flow of urban life
early wednesday , president trump appeared to cast the manhattan attack as a european import , tweeting about retired u.s. intelligence officer anthony shaffer 's statements on a talk show criticizing sen. charles e. schumer ( d-n.y. )
'senator chuck schumer helping to import europes problems , he tweeted , citing shaffer , in an apparent reference to a 1990 visa measure supported by schumer and signed by president george h.w
trump wrote we will stop this craziness
but as leaders across the atlantic expressed their sympathies , few could offer concrete recommendations about how to prevent this increasingly prevalent form of terrorist violence
but those expressions of solidarity did not include advice
in the past two years , often in quick succession , many of europe 's major urban centers have been targeted by vehicle attacks
in 2016 , crowds in nice , france , and berlin were targeted in incidents that killed 86 and 12 , respectively
this year , stockholm , barcelona and london were struck the british capital on three separate occasions in a wave of violence that claimed more than 35 lives combined
other isolated incidents have been reported in france
why truck attacks are so common in europe , but not the united states
the vehicle attackers use such rudimentary weapons precisely because they know they wo n't be prevented by security forces , said jean-charles brisard , director of the paris-based center for the analysis of terrorism
on some level , it 's impossible you can not keep every rental agency under surveillance
but brisard added that there are certain measures that cities can take , regardless of macro security policy imposed by governments
last month , the european commission released a set of guidelines designed to better defend eu citizens against terrorist threats and deliver a europe that protects
for the most part , these european efforts will include funding as much as 100 million euros ( $ 116 million ) to be invested in city security initiatives
there will also be a forum for cities to exchange their best practices
immediate responses to this new form of terrorist violence have focused mostly on erecting physical barriers to better protect pedestrians
how harsh counterterrorism measures can play into the hands of the islamic state
at the cannes film festival held each may , strong metal barriers and sturdy planters were installed this year at the entrances to a busy seaside promenade often packed with pedestrians and tourists
the same was true at france 's popular avignon theater festival , where israeli-made vehicle barriers were used to secure entry areas
that a truck could enter a nominally secured area caused an enormous outcry in france , where inquiries into police bureaucracy often blamed a complicated system of national and local squadrons that did not coordinate sufficiently
much the same has been true in britain , where london mayor sadiq khan immediately condemned the new york attack
he said in a statement tuesday that london stands in grief and solidarity with the great city of new york tonight after the despicable and cowardly terrorist attack in manhattan
in the wake of the vehicle attacks in london this year , the british capital ramped up its security with the installation of barriers on its bridges , two of which were targeted earlier this year
in the london bridge attack , three men drove a van into pedestrians before they got out and began stabbing patrons at a nearby market
in other cities around britain , local authorities plan to bolster security at christmas markets by installing obstructions in pedestrian areas
the barriers were installed on three bridges waterloo , westminster and lambeth
british security analysts said those relatively small changes represent a significant shift
previously , some street market would n't get anything , pantucci said
now it does get some attention , and you do see people thinking about putting up barriers or blocking direct access from the street
pantucci also noted that police and security services are reaching out to car rental companies to get onto their radar that this is a possibility and to keep attentive as best you can
several of the attackers in europe have used rented vehicles
toby poston , a spokesman for the british vehicle rental and leasing association , said the industry is also working with authorities to explore sharing customer information at an early enough stage that can be cross-referenced with their counterterrorism watch lists
in germany , however , the focus has been less on physical barriers than on the question of why a particular assailant , such as the 24-year-old anis amri , responsible for the berlin attack , had not been deported or apprehended
amri had been slated to be sent back to his native tunisia , but his return was delayed for bureaucratic reasons
he had also been under surveillance as a suspected radical islamist who dabbled in drug dealing
but he had dropped off intelligence services radar
a federal inquiry by a retired prosecutor released last month was scathing in its assessment of law enforcement 's handling of the case
gross mistakes were made that should never have happened , said the leader of the inquiry , bruno jost
immediately after the attack , authorities vowed to be more aggressive in deporting those who failed to secure asylum in germany
but those efforts have been hindered , primarily because countries of origin for would-be deportees have resisted taking them back
