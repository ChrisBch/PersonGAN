when a balloon depicting london mayor sadiq khan lying on his side and clad in a yellow bikini was launched in parliament square on saturday , the response was more muted
bikini khan , as organizers called the 29-foot inflatable , was floated in response to the trump baby balloon
on saturday , a small crowd of supporters and amused onlookers gathered in parliament square to watch the launch of bikini khan.
the choice of the bikini was a reference to khan 's 2016 removal of advertisements featuring a woman in a bikini from the subway and the transit system for promoting unhealthy or unrealistic body images
at the launch of the khan blimp , organizers wore t-shirts that read make london safe again , a reference to londons crime rates under khan 's watch and trump 's make america great again slogan
some wore khan face masks
one woman had an inflatable pig with a khan mask on
spotted at todays rather pitiful sadiq khan blimp launch in parliament square - a handful of known far-right extremists and a couple of people carrying inflatable pigs with khan masks on
when the balloon launched , a handful of people shouted , higher , higher.
meanwhile , bruere has come under scrutiny over a deleted twitter account
bellingcat , a group of online investigators , said it found deleted tweets by him that some have said were anti-semitic and promoted conspiracy theories
the tweets were taken out of context

organizers of both balloon efforts said they were overwhelmed by the response and plan to take the blimps on tour
the organizers of the bikini khan balloon raised more than 59,000 pounds , equal to about $ 77,000 , through crowdfunding the trump baby balloon crowdfunding effort raised more than 34,000 pounds , or about $ 44,000
trump suggested that the trump baby balloon was one of the reasons he spent little time in london during his visit
trump told the sun newspaper in july
which inflatable was better
that 's debatable , but both were amusing
and perhaps there will be more hot air to come
a sight to behold
london should start doing this annually
get a blimp of may or corbyn next
do all the politicians
