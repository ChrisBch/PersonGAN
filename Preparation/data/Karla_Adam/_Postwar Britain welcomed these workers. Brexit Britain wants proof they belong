london anthony bryan was watching the news in his studio apartment one morning in september 2016 when immigration authorities and police showed up with a battering ram
said the 60-year-old grandfather , who followed his mother from jamaica to britain in 1965 as part of a government-sanctioned migration movement to ease labor shortages and help rebuild the country
bryan said he spent five weeks in two separate detention centers in the past two years
immigration officials booked him on a plane to jamaica , until a lawyer intervened
to be honest , it wasnt nice , he said , demonstrating the british knack for understatement
we are genuinely sorry for any anxiety that has been caused.
may is closely associated with the tightening of immigration rules
when she was home secretary in 2012 , she boasted of creating a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants.
but , unlike the dreamers at the center of similar controversy in the united states , the windrush families came to britain legally , arriving from commonwealth countries in the caribbean
they were subjects of the crown , invited by the british government
oxford universitys migration observatory estimates that about 500,000 people born in commonwealth countries moved to britain before 1971 , which marked the end of the right to free movement from across the commonwealth
the problem is that some of these people do not have the paperwork to prove they have a place in the only country they have known for decades
they have been caught in bureaucratic limbo , struggling to meet the governments demand for documentation in some cases , up to four separate pieces of evidence for each year they have lived in britain
people have lost jobs , been denied health services or received threats of deportation
said michael braithwaite , 66 , who moved to britain in 1961
he worked as a special-needs assistant at an elementary school in north london for 15 years before he lost his job last year because he was unable to pull together all the necessary documents
the scandal has drawn widespread fury uniting politicians and newspapers from across the political spectrum
a petition on parliaments website calling for amnesty for anyone who was a minor arriving in britain between 1948 and 1971 received more than 150,000 signatures , surpassing the threshold for parliamentary debate
more than 140 lawmakers sent a letter to the prime minister demanding that the government find an immediate and effective response to the situation
the measures backed by may as home secretary included requiring immigration status checks by doctors , teachers , landlords and employers
campaigners say these changes have resulted in discrimination
the controversy has also stoked fears among the 3 million citizens of the european union who live in britain and wonder about their status next year after the country leaves the e.u
guy verhofstadt , the european parliaments brexit chief , told the independent
the 2016 brexit vote was largely fueled by anti-immigrant ire and demands for tougher policies
yet british authorities now must work out rules that recognize the countrys long tradition of welcoming newcomers from corners of the former british empire
on monday , the government said that it would set up a task force dedicated to helping members of the windrush generation formalize their immigration status
bryan said he lost his job in 2015 when he couldnt produce the correct paperwork for his employers , who faced a fine of about $ 14,000 if they continued to employ him
but he said that on his way into a television studio on monday night , an immigration official suggested in passing that his biometric card was ready establishing that he is in britain legally
