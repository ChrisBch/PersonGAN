london shortly after midnight on june 14 , 2017 , a small fire started in the kitchen of an immigrant taxi driver on the fourth floor of grenfell tower
he quickly called the fire brigade
but within minutes , the conflagration was crawling up and around the facade of the 24-story public housing bloc with astonishing speed and ferocity
ultimately , the blaze claimed the lives of 72 people the deadliest fire in modern british history
the tragedy rocked the political establishment and provoked a national conversation about fire-safety enforcement , the inadequacies of britains public housing , and londons haves and have-nots
many grenfell residents were immigrants
most loved the tower it wasnt a slum , it was nice , one resident after another told the washington post
it was harmonious
and the views were spectacular
a public inquiry is underway , and testimony has revealed a jaw-dropping list of things that went wrong , from the smoke ventilation system failing to the fire service ordering residents to stay put.
many experts believe the exterior panels installed in 2016 plastic and aluminum cladding encouraged the fires rapid spread
at the center of the inquiry is a group referred to as the bereaved , survivors and neighborhood residents or the bsrs and their lawyers , who are asking questions and seeking justice for grenfell.
here are the stories of three
ahmed chellat keeps the bedroom curtains closed so his wife , gita , doesnt have to see the blackened high-rise where her brother and his family died
during an hour-long interview at a cafe , three separate people approached him to offer condolences
one volunteered to buy him food , but chellat waved him off , explaining he was fasting for the muslim holy month of ramadan
chellat , 61 , recounted that he was about to sit down for a late ramadan supper last june when the fire brigade arrived
he talked on the phone to his sister-in-law , faouzia el-wahabi , as the inferno engulfed the building
about two hours in , she told him that smoke was coming under the doors and that they were being instructed to move to another room
that was the last he heard
chellat was one of the many relatives who spoke in honor of the dead at the beginning of the government-sponsored grenfell inquiry
the memorials , he said , were a relief and gave the inquiry some personality.
el-wahabi , 42 , was remembered as a proud mum who regularly helped out at her kids school , even if it wasnt her kids class
her husband , abdulaziz , 52 , was a chatty hospital porter who liked to call people mate or governor or darling.
like faouzia , he was originally from morocco , and they had known each other since they were young
his 9-year-old cousin and grenfell neighbor sara chebiouni said in a tribute at the inquiry
but while the commemorations were cathartic , chellat said , government support for the bereaved has been lacking some didnt know how to find help
meanwhile , other people were scamming the system
last week , nine people were arrested on charges of grenfell-related fraud
chellat said the underlying causes of the fire were human error or human greed , to save a few pennies.
each day , teresa griffin can be found lighting candles , sweeping with a broom and tending to the flowers at a makeshift memorial a block from the sooty hulk of grenfell tower
it helps me cope , griffin , a 55-year-old caregiver , said when asked why she maintains the shrine
the grenfell tribute wall is filled with fading messages written by her neighbors , people voicing anger and heartbreak.
we want answers , reads one.
i promise to fight for you , reads another.
justice for grenfell.
griffin grew up in this north kensington neighborhood
she knew people who lived and died in the 24-floor tower
jessica urbano ramirez , 12 , was a good friend of her daughters
griffin recalled watching people on the upper floors of the tower turn the lights on their cellphones on and off , like an sos.
she saw children at the windows above , one moment there and then suddenly gone behind thick blankets of smoke
she heard women screaming
afterward , she welcomed police and fire officials into her apartment for milky tea and bacon sandwiches
she took in three boys who were suddenly homeless and fed them cornflakes
they recently gave her a bouquet of flowers for her birthday
her daughters high school , next to the tower , is reopening in the fall , and she is worried about possible health effects on the students , especially if the tower is demolished
we dont need to be fickle about our emotions.
because now its like a dark hole.
antonio roncolato was one of the last to escape grenfell tower
emergency services had told him to stay put , and so he did , for five agonizing hours , as his 10th-floor apartment slowly filled with smoke
i am lucky to be alive.
finally , roncolato , 58 , was rescued by two firefighters who led him down a smoke-choked stairwell one officer in front , the other behind him while he struggled to breathe through a wet towel
he wore a pair of swimming goggles to protect his eyes
roncolato , an italian who moved to london in his early 20s , works as a restaurant manager at the hotel where the grenfell inquiry began
after finishing his shift , he would listen to the testimonies honoring the dead his neighbors , his friends
a year on , it seems like it happened yesterday , he said
he is still waiting for a replacement apartment
three days after the fire , british prime minister theresa may confidently vowed that all the victims would be rehoused in three weeks
of the 203 households from the tower , 121 are still in emergency or temporary accommodations
the local council says 90 percent of the 203 have accepted offers of permanent accommodations , but the majority have yet to actually move in
grenfell residents do not have to pay rent or utility bills until july 2019
roncolato lived in a kensington hotel for seven months and then moved into a pretty nice flat nearby
pointing out his few remaining possessions , he stopped at a coat rack and touched a black jacket and a blue adidas backpack.
this is what i left with , he said
a flower vase recovered from his grenfell apartment still reeks of smoke
he adored the view from that apartment , where he lived for 27 years , but he no longer wants to live in a high-rise
the local council has shown him five or six apartments in as many months , but he said they were unsuitable
he wants to wait until he is offered a comparable home
roncolato is an active member of grenfell united , a group of survivors fighting for their rights and for potentially flammable cladding to be removed from other buildings across britain
