london prime minister theresa mays government was thrown into turmoil late sunday with the surprise resignation of david davis , her brexit minister in charge of negotiating britains exit from the european union
in his letter of resignation , davis told may that her tactics and proposals make it look less and less likely that britain would leave europes single market and customs unions -- two promises may has made
davis said the governments approach will just lead to further demands from brussels and will give europe control of large swaths of the british economy
boris johnson and brexit minister resign , leaving theresa mays government in dissarray
the prime ministers plan for a soft brexit was pushed forward by may at a crunch cabinet meeting at her countryside residence , called chequers , on friday
this , her critic charged , would shackle britain and make it a rule taker versus a rule maker
may was scheduled to address all tory parliamentarians at a meeting on monday night
now some conservatives who are pushing for a hard brexit threaten that the prime minister soon face a no-confidence vote
the british political press said more resignations might follow
reaction came thick and fast on monday -- for those who were awake
some brexit backers cheered davis on
opposition lawmakers , meanwhile , said that this was a big blow for the prime minister
