do you know which harry potter characters share their names with ancient constellations
what 's the incantation for the levitating charm
do you know your bowtruckles from your basilisks
because there will be a trivia test
it has been 20 years since j.k. rowling charmed readers of all ages with the publication of the first harry potter book , and it seems many of us are still spellbound
to mark the anniversary , the british library has swung open its doors for harry potter a history of magic , a new exhibition that explores the history behind the wizarding world
others , too , are paying tribute
on june 26 exactly 20 years to the day since the first book was published in the united kingdom harry potter was trending worldwide on social media
on saturday evening , the bbc aired a documentary that includes a rare interview with rowling
not that it takes much to motivate potter enthusiasts
last month , for instance , thousands of muggles descended on platform 9 at king 's cross station to mark the day that harry potter 's son albus left for hogwarts
the latest draw is the exhibition at the british library , which sold a record 30,000 tickets even before its opening last week
the show delves into the historical links with the fantastical world dreamed up by rowling who studied classics and french at university by exploring the wider cultural context in which the books are set
for those able to harness their inner hermione , the library is hosting quiz nights to test visitors on their wizarding knowledge
perhaps the most exciting aspect for fans is the scores of items donated by rowling herself , including original handwritten extracts from various potter books with lines crossed out and annotations from the author
there are also a number of intricate drawings ( yes , she can draw )
for instance , one is of professor sprout sketched on december 30 , 1990
in the bbc documentary , rowling said she can recall the exact date because it was the night her mother died 250 miles away
she also revealed that the film she was watching at the same time may have inspired the deathly hallows symbol
the potter series is hugely about loss , rowling told the broadcaster
i 've said this before if my mother had n't died , i think the stories would be utterly different
another drawing on display is a map of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry , complete with a quidditch field and a lake with a giant squid
the first review of her work is also on display
alice newton , the 8-year-old daughter of the founder of bloomsbury , wrote on a piece of paper the excitement in this book made me feel warm inside
i think it is possibly one of the best books an 8/9 year old could read
the day after she penned the note , bloomsbury agreed to publish harry potter and the philosopher 's stone
the exhibit is lined with book wallpaper and is dimly lit
cauldrons and tea cups float from the ceiling , and an invisibility cloak is , apparently , hanging from a hook
it 's organized by the school curriculum at hogwarts , so visitors explore rooms dedicated to subjects including potions , herbology , divination , astronomy and defense against the dark arts
it helps bring stories to life to see the real concepts behind them , said alexander lock , a mustachioed historian and one of the curators of the exhibit
leaning over the glass case containing the scroll , lock pointed to an image depicting a black stone , a white stone and a red stone
he noted that sirius 's last name is black , and that albus dumbledore is latin for white and rubeus hagrid is latin for red
the scroll is displayed alongside the tombstone of nicholas flamel , a name shared by a character in the first harry potter book
on loan from the muse de cluny in paris , the headstone was reportedly found in the 19th century at a parisian grocery store where it was being used as a chopping board
the real-life flamel was a parisian landlord and bookdealer who died in 1418
after his death , rumors surfaced that he was an alchemist his work was referenced by isaac newton who had unlocked the secret to creating a philosopher 's stone
i heard when they extracted flamel 's tombstone , they did n't actually find a body , so it could well be true , said lock , smiling
in addition to borrowing artifacts from other museums , the library draws on its own rich collection to display ancient books like liber medicinalis , which features the earliest recorded use of abracadabra , a charm thought to have healing powers
in the herbology section , there are ancient manuscripts on mandrakes , plants with roots that look humanlike
in harry potter and the chamber of secrets , professor sprout asks her students to wear earmuffs when replanting baby mandrakes because of their insanely loud cries
indeed , it was long believed that when the root of the plant was yanked from the ground , it would scream and kill anyone who heard it
according to a 15th century book on display , the recommended way of harvesting mandrakes included the use of a horn to drown out the shrieking
in the astronomy room , which is dominated by a 400-year-old celestial globe , visitors discover the constellations that share names with characters in the book , including bellatrix lestrange and sirius black
keen stargazers will know that the brightest star in the night sky is called sirius , also known as the dog star
the reviews so far have been generally strong , with many critics noting the breadth of material on display
some have said that it does n't hang together as a whole or that younger children may become fidgety near the end but most agree that potter fans will gobble it up
for her part , rowling said it was wonderful and appeared to be particularly taken by the tombstone of one of her characters
she tweeted a picture of it with the caption guess what this is
i 've just seen it and was mesmerised
all of this is fair game for the harry potter quiz nights
harry potter a history of magic is at the british library until the end of february 2018
it transfers to new york 's historical society next october
