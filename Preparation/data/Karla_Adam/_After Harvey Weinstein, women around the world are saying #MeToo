london the wave of revelations and revulsion over harvey weinstein has gone global
as a-list actresses level claims of sexual misconduct at the now-disgraced hollywood mogul , ordinary women everywhere engaged in a collective outpouring of their stories of assaults and sexual harassment inspired by an online campaign made famous by alyssa milano
and , as the metoo ranks swelled , there is also a sense of bitterness about how sexism remains rooted in many parts of the world including places seen as progressive in women 's rights
this has been part of our world women 's world since time immemorial , said the british actress emma thompson when asked by the bbc about the weinstein scandal
indeed , the statistics compiled by the stop street harassment campaign in the united states make for sober reading
the group highlights a 2014 study by yougov that ranked the safety of transit systems for women in 16 cities around the world
bogota was the most unsafe city in the survey , while mexico city was the worst for verbal and physical harassment with 64 percent of women respondents saying they had been groped or harassed on public transit
within hours of milano 's metoo call , the hashtag was trending worldwide with stories pouring in from calgary to cairo , from paris to perth
the two-word hashtag has been tweeted over half a million times and has been featured in more than 12 million posts on facebook
on arab social media sites , women jumped into the conversation using the hashtag anakaman , the arabic translation of me too
a 63-year-old australian woman tweeted that harassment was present all through my early working life in the 70 's & 80 's while working at the department of defense in sydney
looking back it was horrendous , she wrote
chinas media says women not harassed in chinese culture

even in countries considered to be progressive , women were sharing stories of abuse

metoo is everywhere
but will it make a difference
in france where president emmanuel macron said he would revoke weinstein 's lgion d'honneur award a separate but similar campaign took root with thousands taking to social media with the hashtag balancetonporc , or squeal on your pig
sandra muller , a french journalist , kicked off the balancetonporc campaign when she encouraged people to name and shame those responsible for sexual harassment
she named her own former boss , whom she said commented on her breasts and told her that she was my type of woman
stories began flooding in , like that of a paris-based radio journalist who tweeted that an editor of a major radio station once grabbed her by the throat and told her she would have sex with him whether you want it or not
she said she filed a complaint but that nothing happened
on monday , marlne schiappa , france 's gender equality minister , said that legislators will debate proposals for cracking down on sexual violence and harassment , including fines for wolf whistling and other sexually tinged comments on the street
this is n't the first time that women and some men have turned to social media en masse to highlight examples of harassment and abuse
five years ago , laura bates , a british writer and campaigner , founded everydaysexism , an online project that catalogues everyday , street-level sexism
she said in an interview that the recent campaigns following the weinstein allegations highlight how enormously widespread the problem is and how too often women are ignored or silenced
many of the patterns seen in stories that have emerged in recent days stories of abuse at home , in the workplace , at schools , in public spaces are not new , bates said
but she said that more women are speaking out
i do n't think we 've seen great strides in the last five years with the problem shifting
what we are seeing is thanks to the incredible courage of women and girls all over the world speaking out about their experiences is the increased tendencies for survivors to be able to talk about what 's happened to them , she said
