london it is an indelicate question , but why arent the skripals dead
said christine blanshard , medical director at salisbury district hospital
the ex-spys 33-year-old daughter , yulia skripal , was also poisoned , but her condition had improved to stable last week
yulia skripal is speaking , issuing statements and allegedly talking to relatives back home in russia on the telephone
her doctor said
how can this be
as the russian government has asked , in its campaign to discredit british assertions that russia was behind the attack , why didnt the skripals collapse immediately if they were poisoned by a powerful nerve agent
if they came into contact with the agent at their doorstep , how did they have the ability to first go to a pub and a restaurant before they succumbed
on march 4 , the skripals were found on a park bench
she was comatose he was awake but disoriented
medical experts attributed their recovery to the readily available treatments and antidotes they probably received at the hospital
toxicologists and medical forensic specialists said nerve agents are most dangerous in the first days after an attack , but given that the skripals pulled through that , it wasnt surprising that their condition was improving
after the doctors statement friday that the elder skripals health had improved , the russian embassy in britain tweeted , good news
a director of a british military laboratory said this week that the nerve agent was definitively from the novichok class , a type designed and manufactured by the former soviet union and russia
the lab , however , could not definitely say where this batch was manufactured
british police investigators say the highest residual concentration of the nerve agent was found at sergei skripals front door in the quiet town of salisbury , down the road from the stonehenge ruins
prime minister theresa may has condemned the poisoning as a reckless and hostile attack by russia on british soil
she and her government say that in addition to forensic evidence , russia is suspect because it has assassinated critics abroad before
skripal was a double agent who sold secrets to britain
he was convicted and jailed in russia but released in a swap of intelligence agents in 2010
mays government , the united states and more than two dozen other countries have expelled about 150 russian diplomats and intelligence agents from their embassies abroad
russia has retaliated with its own expulsions
