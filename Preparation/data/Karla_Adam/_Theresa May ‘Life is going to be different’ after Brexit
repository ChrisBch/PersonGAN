during her 45-minute speech , may set out her proposals for a future relationship between the united kingdom and the e.u
but she said hard facts need to be faced
i want to be straight with people , said may , who hoped to address criticisms that the british governments brexit position so far has been at best vague and at worst implausible
mays long-awaited remarks , called our future partnership , represented her third big speech on brexit since the 2016 vote in which a narrow majority of britons opted to leave the e.u
and were billed as a pivotal moment
across the english channel , e.u
leaders were listening closely , hoping for concrete solutions to issues such as the northern ireland border and how to achieve the as frictionless as possible trade that may has demanded
may , who has ruled out staying in the single market or a customs union , talked about a need for reciprocal binding commitments and an independent arbitration system
she also said that certain british sectors such as the pharmaceutical , aviation and chemical industries may seek to remain a part of existing e.u
agencies , meaning they would abide by their rules and make financial contributions
she said that the government was committed to no hard border between the republic of ireland and northern ireland , but that a deal was possible that would also leave britain open to striking its own international trade deals
she didnt outline specifics on what such an arrangement would look like
in a briefing note , he said that may offered no new ideas on how to solve the irish border problem and noted that her pick and mix approach has been constantly ruled out by the eu27.
the speech comes at the end of a rough week for may
she saw pro-business lobby groups applaud the opposition labour partys call for the u.k. to stay in a customs union
she tussled with e.u
officials over their proposal that would effectively see northern ireland remain part of the customs union
and she faced interventions from two former british prime ministers
john major , the conservative prime minister from 1990 to 1997 , said lawmakers should have a free vote on the final deal and the option of a new referendum
if brexit flops , he said , there will be the most terrible backlash.
his successor , the labour prime minister tony blair , said mays brexit plan is literally not going to happen and lambasted those who dismiss the northern ireland border issue as insignificant
said blair , who played a crucial role in the 1998 good friday agreement that helped end decades of violence
may delivered her speech at mansion house , an 18th-century building in the center of londons financial district , in front of an audience that included e.u
ambassadors and journalists
the venue was hastily relocated from the northeastern city of newcastle , as britain struggles to cope with its heaviest snowfall in decades
