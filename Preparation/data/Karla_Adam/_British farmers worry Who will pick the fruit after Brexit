harewood end , england after a dozen futile calls to big farms , agricultural lobbyists and labor contractors , we finally found him
the rarest of the rare , the british berry picker
meet max hughes , a 20-year-old university student and history major , who is spending his summer harvesting black currants at the snell family farm in herefordshire
he rides in the back of a harvester all day , standing beside a czech migrant and a couple of sun-bronzed romanian guys , who know very little english
hughes said , gesturing toward the wheeled harvester beside him
britain today is completely dependent on foreign workers to pick its fruit and vegetables
according to the national farmers union , an industry lobbying group , of the 60,000 seasonal workers in the fields last year , barely 1 percent was british
the vast majority come from eastern europe , particularly bulgaria and romania
but as britain prepares to leave the e.u. , bringing the era of free movement to a close , farmers have begun to panic who will pick the crops next spring
already , labor shortages driven by economic shifts have left produce rotting in the strawberry fields and the high-tech , hydroponic poly-tunnels where top-tier soft fruit is produced
jacqui green , chief executive of the berry gardens growers cooperative , reports a 30 to 40 percent shortfall in labor this year
during the 2016 brexit campaign , anxiety over mass migration was top of mind , fueled in part by claims that , for example , millions of muslims would arrive as soon as turkey joined the e.u
( turkey is not in the union and has no prospect of joining in the foreseeable future )
with britains exit from the bloc , prime minister theresa may vows that the country will regain control of our borders and dramatically curtail immigration
if far fewer workers come from europe , those jobs will have to be filled by brits who dont seem very keen , truth be told or contracted from belarus or nepal or the philippines
britain had such a foreign farmworker scheme in the past , but it was scrapped and now there are growing calls to restart it
stephanie maurel , the chief executive of concordia , a recruitment company that supplies workers to about 200 british farms , said theyve had virtually zero brits apply
weve had two applications out of 10,000 , she said.
its statistically quite damning.
and , unless youre a local , you live in a trailer
often a nice trailer , with wifi , but still
maurel said some brits work in less taxing farm jobs as logistics managers or office staff but even those higher-paying , indoor jobs are mostly taken by eastern europeans these days
she said the rare british workers who give the fruit and vegetable harvest a try , literally dont last a week.
hughes and three other university students are the only brits harvesting berries at the snell family farm this summer , out of a workforce of 300
snell drove a washington post reporter out to see these exotic british berry workers
they looked hot and dusty but otherwise like healthy contestants on a reality tv show
for hughes , the long workday begins at 5 a.m. and ends in the late afternoon
he said with overtime and bonuses for quick sorting , he could make almost $ 4,000 for six weeks of six-day work
the worst part , he said , is the dull , repetitive nature of the job
he zones out by listening to music through his ear buds.
its not a bad summer job , he said
but he and his mates think they understand why so few brits want farm jobs
meaning work for poor people.
many observers have suggested that brits today are too lazy to do the farm work of their yeoman ancestors
hiscox said that physically , the british worker could definitely do this job.
he said the work provides an outdoor life and decent pay for a young person
elliot packham , 22 , who just graduated from cardiff university , wondered , if the pay were better , more might try.
he noted that strawberries would then cost more
so theres the economics of it , he said
some british commentators have suggested that maybe recently released felons could be employed on the farms the way german prisoners of war were used during world war ii
others have wondered if hale and hearty britons living on social welfare benefits could be prodded to bend their backs to bring in a crop of strawberries
( though those who receive such benefits may question if the work would be worth the risk of not requalifying for benefits after the season ends )
she said back home the governments are not so generous.
better to work , she said
helen whately , a conservative party politician who chairs the all-party parliamentary group for fruit and vegetable farmers , said growers would be facing a shortage of labor without brexit , but the vote to leave the e.u
has arguably made the problem a bit more acute.
already , it has contributed to a weakening of the pound , thus decreasing the financial incentives for foreign workers , at the same time that economies are improving in source countries , such as romania
whately is campaigning for a seasonal agricultural workers scheme that could include countries outside of the e.u
and would allow pickers to come and work for a defined and limited period of time
other than that
but berries are notoriously difficult to pick mechanically , snell said
adrian cirstea , the packing house and logistics manager at the snell farm , who is originally from romania , imagines that after brexit , british growers will have to look far and wide for labor
theyll have to go further east and further south , he said , to africa and asia , to find workers
meaning that britain may see the same number of foreign farmworkers , but fewer bulgarians and more from eritrea and moldova
maybe even turkey
