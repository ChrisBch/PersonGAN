london ben abdi sent his sister in iran two messages on tuesday and by the weekend had n't heard a peep back
how 's dad
what 's happening
he sent the messages over the messaging service whatsapp , but by friday evening the checks next to the messages had n't even switched blue , meaning they were still unread
was she okay
why had n't she read them
where was she
for many iranians living in exile , the past nine days have been a mix of emotions fear , foreboding , hope as they intently watch , as best they can , the deadly unrest unfolding in their native land
the demonstrations , which began dec. 28 in mashhad before rippling quickly and spontaneously across iran , have resulted in at least 20 deaths and hundreds of arrests
many of those taking to the streets are young and working-class , rallying against high youth unemployment , rising prices and poor wages
for some iranians living in britain , which has one of the largest diasporas in europe , it has been a struggle to stay in touch with family and keep abreast of events back home because of restrictions placed on social media tools
if you send 10 messages , one will get through , said abdi , a 45-year-old iranian who runs a persian restaurant in north london , festooned with ancient iranian artifacts and seasonal decorations , including a christmas tree with a red star
he said his sister 's telegram channel has been worryingly inactive
she 's a beautician and normally posts a couple of photos of her clients hairdos on the internet messaging service every day
she has n't posted any for about six days , he said
analysts say iranian authorities have tried to crack down on the unrest by restricting access to the internet and trying to control social media sometimes blocking information , sometimes using social media to peddle their own messages
tens of thousands of people have protested in iran
sanam vakil , an iran expert at chatham house , a london-based think tank , said the iranian government has been really sophisticated in using social media to police society and groups
they very quickly started doing that , sending messages using social media to warn people not to join protests
she also stressed that the restrictions , including on internet access in some areas , have been patchy rather than a total blackout
within days of the protests starting , authorities started restricting some social media tools , including telegram , which is wildly popular in iran
many iranians in britain interviewed for this article said they were still receiving social media messages , including on telegram , but fewer and less frequently than normal
several people said they began to have connectivity issues around tuesday
oh , i just had a reply to a telegram message that 's the beep you heard , said shadi , 42 , during a phone interview
i messaged them two hours ago , she said , noting that normally she would have received a reply instantly
shadi , who asked that her surname and job title not be used , works for a company that imports heavy machinery into iran
it 's scary this time , she said , comparing the unrest to protests in 2009 prompted by the outcome of national elections in iran
she said hearing protesters chant death to this , death to that sends a chill down my spine
to hear people in iran say it as openly as they are saying it is scary , because this regime is brutal
protests threaten irans ascendant role in the middle east
as traditional persian music played in the background at abdi 's restaurant in north london , iranians were discussing the art of talking about the demonstrations with people inside iran without mentioning the demonstrations
maryam , 37 , said she chose to stop using telegram
it 's too dangerous
it 's too controlled , she said
she still communicates daily with her sister in iran but uses whatsapp and tango , she said , and even then , we are afraid to say something about them , so we say just , 'hi , how are you
he did not elaborate
instead of saying , 'have you seen the protests
you might say , 'have you gone out for shopping
interjected a man sitting across the table from him , which prompted a slight smile and nod
when asked whether they are keeping abreast of the latest developments inside iran , the two men whipped out their smartphones and began scrolling through about a dozen videos of protests on their facebook and instagram feeds that had been uploaded friday evening
working-class anger in iran shows governments vulnerability
in one video , a bus pulled up and the crowd scattered
they have come to kill the people , said shamoo , pointing at the bus , which he believed was transporting security forces
the iranian government is like the mafia , he said , adding that the economic pressures on working-class people were severe
iran is a rich country , and yet there is so much pressure on normal people , wages , food , money everything
will the current protests change things
we hope so , he said , scrolling through his facebook feed
we hope so
