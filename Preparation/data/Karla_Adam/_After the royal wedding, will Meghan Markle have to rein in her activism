london before she retired as an actress and shut down her social media accounts , before she got engaged to prince harry and committed to the firm , as young british royals call their institution , meghan markle had opinions and spoke her mind
she has written forthrightly about being a strong , confident mixed-race woman.
but what will her activism look like after she marries harry on saturday
the royal family has survived the modern age by remaining zealously apolitical
they are relentlessly on-message about having no political message
royals cut ribbons
royals do the hand-wave
they support charities
they burnish the family brand , worth $ 88 billion , according to forbes
with their corgis and stag hunts , tax havens and tweed , one might fairly suspect theyre all tories to the bone
the trick is , we dont know
so here comes meghan markle and some people are wondering aloud what if she goes for it
ran one headline in the guardian newspaper
said sam smethers , chief executive of the fawcett society , a womens rights organization
and yet , this is a constitutional monarchy
she will have to dial it back , completely , said dickie arbiter , the queens former press secretary
he said senior royals must take care not get too far out in front of the queen , who has a constitutional obligation to remain above the political fray
in britain , the queen reigns but does not rule
so far , markle seems to be working hard to fit in
the 36-year-old , who portrayed can-do paralegal rachel zane on the usa network series suits , has given up her acting career and her lifestyle blog
she was baptized and confirmed into the church of england
she has been spotted doing the duchess slant , sitting with knees and ankles together , lower legs on a diagonal
she may buck orthodoxy and deliver her own speech at her wedding reception
mayer said there is nothing exceptional about the humanitarian work markle has done traveling to rwanda to promote access to clean drinking water , advocating for girls education in india
other celebrities have taken on similar causes
and those sorts of trips are very much in the royal mold
princess diana was known for her active involvement in campaigns to raise awareness about aids , land mines and leprosy
prince harry has taken up some of her issues and added others , including support for military veterans and wildlife conservation
but markle is different from other british royals , mayer said , in her views and lived experiences.
markle is also an american , an outsider
although she will become a british citizen , she may not instinctively know , or automatically accept , her place in britains rigid class system.
thats enormously helpful , mayer said
party politics will almost certainly remain a no-go zone
but beyond that , markle may find she has some leeway
the heir to the throne is prince charles , 69 , who goes on about carbon footprints , organic manure , holistic medicines and his hatred of modern architecture
as king , perhaps he would provide some room to maneuver for an activist daughter-in-law
it also may help that markle is marrying a spare heir , who was recently bumped down to sixth in the line of succession with the birth of his nephew , prince louis
but he added that there is less worry for those who are quite far away.
