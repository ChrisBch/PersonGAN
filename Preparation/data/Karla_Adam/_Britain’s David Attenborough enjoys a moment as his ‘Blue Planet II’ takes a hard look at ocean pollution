london the most-watched television program in britain last year was not a singing competition , a period costume drama or even a baking show
it was a nature program about gender-bending fish and dolphins that like to surf
the seven-part bbc documentary , presented by a beloved nonagenarian naturalist , was not unalloyed entertainment , though
it also zeroed in on the disastrous impact of plastic waste in the world 's oceans , spurring government ministers to vow remedial action
blue planet ii enthralled british viewers , who lit up social media on sunday nights with their favorite moments from the latest episode
the sumptuously shot series , which begins airing on bbc america on jan. 20 , took four years to make , with filmmakers traveling to every continent and every ocean
it could be that the moment is right for a documentary on the state of the oceans , said sir david attenborough , the show 's human star , in a recent interview at the bbc 's gleaming offices in central london
there are people worldwide talking about what we are doing about the seas
consider the plastic drinking straw why do we suck so much
it also could be that the grandfatherly attenborough is just the right man to deliver the message
at 91 , he is a british national treasure something like jacques cousteau , carl sagan and jane goodall rolled into one
in person , attenborough , who was knighted in 1985 and is called sir david by bbc colleagues , is a master storyteller
he has a shock of white hair and bright blue eyes , and he speaks with the same distinctive cadence and whispered confidences whether about leaking submersibles or wondrous salamanders that have entranced british viewers for decades
he is also a born broadcaster , his velvety voice propelling footage of tool-using tusk fish and giant trevally fish that catch birds in midair
some of attenborough 's previous programs have drawn criticism for pulling punches about human threats to the environment
martin hughes-games , a fellow bbc producer , has argued that in one series , the footage was so jaw-dropping that it lulled viewers into a false sense of security
blue planet ii , a sequel to a 2001 series about marine life , is different
it features fish with transparent heads and a nail-biting chase scene involving a crab , eel and octopus that will make you think twice about your next frolic in shallow seas
but it also directly addresses plastic pollution , overfishing and climate change
attenborough insists that the bbc did not set out to make an ax-grinding program
but , he added , if you come across the situation that we have come across , you ca n't just say , 'well , we do n't like that because it 's an uncomfortable or awkward truth
that hard-hitting approach appears to have struck a chord in britain , where several media outlets are running campaigns aimed at reducing marine plastic pollution an estimated 9 million tons of plastic end up in the sea each year
the issue also has risen to the top of the global agenda
in december , 193 nations signed a u.n. resolution pledging to stop plastic waste from entering the sea
britain recycles less plastic than many other european countries , including norway and germany
attenborough , who says he personally has swapped out plastic water bottles for a thermos , is optimistic that a solution to the plastics problem can be found
if we are clever enough to be able to invent it , surely we should be clever enough to be able to think of ways of destroying it , he said
theres literally a ton of plastic garbage for every person on earth
if part of the solution , as the series implies , is for a concerted global effort , what does attenborough make of president trump 's decision to pull out of the paris climate agreement
it would be absurd to say it did n't have an impact , he said
it 's the most powerful nation on earth , so of course it matters a lot
but at the same time , he said , it is against the tide of human interests
i mean , china , for heaven 's sake india is behind it
the world is becoming aware of this
blue planet ii was also a hit with critics , who have called it astonishing , awe-inspiring and playing a different sport from most of what makes it onto our screens
attenborough has worked at the bbc since 1950 , including eight years as controller of bbc two
although he brushes off the suggestion that he is a national treasure who says
i mean , it is n't voted for , he said it is a fact that he has played a formidable role in encouraging audiences worldwide to care about the natural world
( it is also a fact that people do vote for attenborough when britons were recently asked which ethical champion they would like to see featured on the new 20-pound note , his name came out on top )
as a young boy , he collected fossils and later studied zoology at cambridge university
he joined the bbc when he was 24 , although his first appearance on television was not an overwhelming success
he went on to write and present numerous award-winning natural history documentaries , along the way inspiring generations of science lovers and wildlife filmmakers including james honeyborne , executive producer of blue planet ii
the audience over here finds it very engaging , he said
attenborough no longer accompanies every shoot in the field
in blue planet ii , he appears on screen in only two episodes , including an introduction shot on the bow of a ship off florida he jokingly called it his titanic scene
for the commentary , recorded in studios in britain , he was given the film and a script , which he then rewrote in his own words
attenborough lives in richmond , a leafy london suburb , with his daughter , susan his wife , jane , died in 1997
he has a slight hobble in his gait but continues to travel the globe for work and says he has no plans to retire
i 'm having fun i 'm having a great time
it 's a fantastic privilege , he said
he also is enjoying something of a moment , being at the crest of a wave
some of us have been going on , saying it 's criminal the way we have been treating the oceans
we have been bleating on about this for a decade with no effect , he said
but it has a cumulative effect , he said , and this is the moment that is the payoff
