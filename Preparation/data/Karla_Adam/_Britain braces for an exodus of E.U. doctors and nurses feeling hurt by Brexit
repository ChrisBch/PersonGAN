bettyhill , scotland from his wind-scoured bungalow , andreas herfurt overlooks the village cemetery , an end place in his line of work
for almost 20 years , the german has served as the town doctor here in the woolly wilds on the north coast of scotland
herfurt is the national health services family physician for 850 souls in a 400-square-mile rural practice
herfurt , 53 , who never became a british citizen , says he has loved his life in the nhs , the united kingdoms much-admired , oft-derided , state-run universal health-care system
he has made decent money , by european standards
and he digs living in the middle of nowhere , with his scottish wife and their big , slobbery dog
but i dont know how much longer we will stay , he said recently , taking a break at his clinic in nearby armadale
the german doctor is not alone in such feelings which could spell disaster for the british health service
like herfurt , many of his european colleagues in the nhs say they were stunned by brexit , the vote by britain in a june 2016 referendum to leave the european union
the exit , which was not backed by most voters in scotland or northern ireland , is scheduled for march 2019
brexit talks on the verge of crucial new stage as theresa may falters
if brexit was driven by strong emotions , so is the reaction to it by some european doctors and nurses in the nhs
in interviews with the washington post , several of those who are thinking about leaving didnt point to overt acts of xenophobia
they acknowledged that nobody is kicking them out of the country
but they are taking brexit personally , expressing indignation at the prospect of having to be vetted in post-brexit britain
many said they would refuse to stand in line for a work visa or submit to a criminal-background check not after years of overseeing life-or-death decisions and emptying bedpans for british patients
they noted that when they came to work here , they were europeans coming to a member state of the european union
they didnt see themselves as immigrants.
they were europeans exercising their right to free movement in europe
they were wooed by the nhs
many never sought british citizenship because they didnt have to
they assumed they could spend their careers , perhaps their whole lives , here
daniela schulze-henning , 43 , an nhs psychologist , recently put her house on the market and plans to move back to germany with her husband , a general practitioner , or gp , and their two children
she said that 70 percent of the people in her london suburb voted for brexit , including a neighbor who had a big leave poster displayed in her window
i hated that , coming home , seeing the leave sign , she said
if the european medical workers do exit in large numbers , they will be missed
this month , parliament published new statistics on nhs staff from overseas , revealing that in britain , about 139,000 or 12.5 percent of nhs staff are from europe and elsewhere
europeans dominate in the most skilled jobs
about 10 percent of doctors and 7 percent of nurses are european nationals
the study did not publish figures for scotland , wales or northern ireland because of differences in reporting , but health experts say the numbers are similar to englands
brexit was propelled by disparate goals voters wanted to slash immigration , not only from countries such as bangladesh or ukraine but from the e.u. , as well
they were also promised a windfall in nhs funding after payments to the bloc ended $ 500 million a week , the leave campaigners vowed , a claim that was later debunked and disavowed
trump thought the british were protesting their health service
the nhs faces crisis-level staff shortages and relies heavily on europeans to do the jobs that british nationals either cant or wont do
european doctors interviewed by the post say their fealty to the united kingdom swings with the headlines
one day , they read that prime minister theresa may has promised britain will always welcome the best and brightest from the continent
the next day , they see hard-line brexiteers in her cabinet insisting that annual net immigration must be slashed from current levels of hundreds of thousands of newcomers to a post-brexit goal in the tens of thousands
many wonder how their children will fare
they are unsettled , too , by the tabloid rhetoric branding brexit opponents enemies of the people.
as a boy growing up in majorca , spain , carlos hoyos remembers being fascinated by british inventors
england embraced openness , he believed
when he visited london as a teenager , something clicked i thought , this is where i want to live.
it has now been 27 years since hoyos moved to the u.k
he lives with his british wife and their two teenage daughters in southampton , on englands south coast , where he works for the nhs as a child and adolescent psychiatrist
its a sense of rejection.
he pointed to sharp declines in the numbers of european nurses and midwives coming to britain at a time when the country needs to hire tens of thousands of nurses
joan pons laplana , 42 , is from barcelona and works as an nhs nurse in chesterfield
he has lived in britain for 17 years and has three children , all born in england
the nhs has buckled under the strain during the current flu season , with hospital corridors crowded with gurneys and 12-hour waits in emergency rooms
heart and cancer surgeries have been postponed
herfurt has continued his usual house calls , his visits to elder-care residences
he said , i am a dinosaur , and added with a flash of frustration , good luck finding my replacement someone who will work long hours in a remote rural practice
if he stays , it will be because of his patients
it has been a privilege to practice this kind of medicine , herfurt said
annie hall , one of his patients , shook her head and said , no , no , no
when asked what she thought about herfurt leaving
he cant go , she said.
hes a local , almost.
