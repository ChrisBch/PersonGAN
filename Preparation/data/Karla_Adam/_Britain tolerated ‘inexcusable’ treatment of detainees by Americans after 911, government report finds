london british intelligence officers did not do enough to stop the inexcusable treatment of detainees by the united states following the sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , according to a parliamentary report released thursday
the committee documented 232 cases in which british officers continued to supply intelligence to its allies when they knew or suspected mistreatment.
in 198 cases , british agencies received intelligence from allies obtained from detainees they knew or should have suspected were being mistreated , the report added
the committee concluded
the committee rejected the argument by the intelligence agencies that the cases were isolated incidents.
the report said
the committee didnt find evidence of british officers directly carrying out the physical mistreatment of detainees , but identified 13 incidents in which officers witnessed a detainee being mistreated
citing concerns about the current u.s. administration , the committee also recommended that the british government make clear its policy on rendition within three months
dominic grieve , the chair of the intelligence and security committee , said at a news conference
the 15 countries that helped the u.s. carried out rendition flights
the committee said there was no evidence of u.s. rendition flights through britain , but added that two detainees transited through diego garcia , a british indian ocean territory
the committee found three cases where british intelligence agencies made , or offered to make , a financial contribution to others to conduct a rendition operation
grieve stressed the importance of recognizing the conditions at the time , when british agencies were concerned about another attack on the scale of 9/11
during their three-year inquiry , the committee reviewed 40,000 original documents but said that the government denied them access to officers who were involved
reprieve , a human rights group , called for an independent judge-led inquiry that could explore the dark corners the committee couldnt reach
moazzam begg , a former guantanamo bay detainee , told the bbc that blair and jack straw , britains prime minister and foreign secretary at the time of the 9/11 attacks , should be prosecuted for war crimes.
