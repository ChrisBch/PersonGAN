london catherine , duchess of cambridge , gave birth to a healthy baby boy on monday , touching off polite , happy but muted jubilation and a few yawns across britain
her husband , prince william , 35 , was by her side for the delivery of their third child , who is a prince
this birth , it must be said , was not as exciting to most britons as the previous ones
the firstborn child may become king the second , queen the third , less likely
in accordance with custom , news of the arrival was displayed on an easel in front of buckingham palace
but by then , everyone knew
the roadway in front of the maternity entrance at st. marys hospital was lined all day with reporters , speaking a babel of languages and doing stand-ups with cameras pointed at the department of obstetrics and gynecology
a surge of royal fans played for the media
but they numbered in the hundreds , not thousands
self-proclaimed royalist tony appleton , 81 , showed up dressed in a feathered tricorn hat , unfurled a faux parchment and roared oyez , oyez , oyez
weve got a royal baby , a prince
i knew it
oh , what a day , said margaret ashford , who was visiting the hospital to see a sick friend when the nearby streets erupted with people shouting in muted british fashion its a boy
prince george , 4 , who was still wearing his school uniform , and princess charlotte , 2 , came to meet their new sibling on monday afternoon
before walking in , charlotte gave a wee royal hand wave to the cannonade of cameras
it was the shot of the day
then , just before 6 p.m. , the world got its first peek at the newest royal , when the duke and the duchess stepped out of the hospital
catherine cradled the newborn in her arms , his tiny fingers poking out from a white blanket
yes , the duchess looked flawless after giving birth
no , this isnt normal
as the cambridges got into their waiting land rover , william told the throng of reporters that he was very delighted , thank you.
thrice the worry now , he added , in a bit of fatherly wisdom
the trio then returned to their home at kensington palace , just a couple miles away , with a police escort
the soon-to-be-named babe is fifth in line for the throne not a bad rsum for his first day on the job
in the dynastic line to succeed great-grandmother queen elizabeth ii , who turned 92 on saturday , the baby is behind grandfather prince charles , father william , brother george and sister charlotte
a 2013 act of parliament removed preference for male heirs
the child is the queens sixth great-grandchild
the baby knocks williams brother , prince harry , down a notch in the succession to the throne
but for royal watchers , the clamor surrounding the birth of the royal baby is merely a warm-up for next month , when harry will marry american actress meghan markle
royal baby fever is sweeping britain , and the photos do not disappoint
despite being overshadowed by that other upcoming event , royal baby fever had ratcheted up in recent weeks thanks in part to parking authorities
kensington palace had disclosed that the baby was due in april
but it never dished on the exact due date
earlier this month , however , yellow signs appeared outside the lindo wing of st. marys hospital , announcing parking restrictions from april 9 to 30 because of an event.
as students of royal baby births know , this was code for royal
a clutch of die-hard fans quickly changed into union jack-themed attire and made a beeline for the hospital
for days , they slept outside on benches and in tents , opined on baby names and stared at the door to the private maternity unit where kate , as she is informally known , would give birth
mused john loughrey , 63 , who had been sleeping in a red tent since april 9
he said monday that the staff at the hospital had been generous , offering them showers , coffee and food
what will the new royal baby be called
the correct answer is worth money
to be sure , the fever never rose to the soaring temperatures of the great kate wait , before catherine gave birth to her first child in 2013
georges arrival was greeted by prime-time specials and wall-to-wall media coverage
and that was just in the united states
but a royal baby is still a royal baby , even if hes the third
attention will soon shift to the name of baby cambridge , which may not be announced immediately
george was two days old when the world learned of his name
luckily , british bookies , who will take bets on nearly anything , are helping to fill that void
arthur , albert and jack are top picks
and to be fair to the bookies , george and charlotte were two of their top picks for the other cambridge children
rupert adams , a spokesman for the bookmaker william hill , said that for george , the bookie took in about 1 million pounds ( $ 1.4 million ) in bets for charlotte , it was about 800,000 pounds ( $ 1.1 million )
last year , william quit his job as an air ambulance pilot , and he and kate packed up the family from their residence in norfolk and moved to kensington palace , in central london
george started school last year in battersea , south london , and earlier this year charlotte started at a nursery near the palace
within seconds of hearing that kate had been admitted to the hospital , twitter erupted in celebration
the hashtag royalbaby began trending
not everyone was thrilled.
