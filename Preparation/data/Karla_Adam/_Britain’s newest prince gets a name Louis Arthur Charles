london william and catherine , the duke and duchess of cambridge , have named their third child louis arthur charles
kensington palace said on friday that his official title will be his royal highness prince louis of cambridge
louis was a somewhat unexpected pick , but its clearly a name admired by the house of windsor
its a middle name of the babys father and brother
it was also the name of the queens cousin lord louis mountbatten , who fans of the crown will know was a mentor to prince charles
mountbatten was killed by an ira bomb in 1979
further proving that the royals are into recycling , the youngest prince shares the middle name arthur with his father , grandfather and great-great-grandfather , king george vi
the babys second middle name , charles , is the first name of his grandfather
shortly after the name was announced , commentators started trying to identify hidden meanings
were the duke and duchess paying homage to france , where the name was popular for royalty
were they on the side of those who wanted britain to remain in the european union and sending a coded message about brexit
were they nodding to the suits character louis litt and the growing influence of american actress meghan markle , soon to marry into the royal family
one twitter user wrote in a common refrain
others joked that perhaps the babys parents were fans of the rhythm and blues song louie louie by the kingsmen , or the musician louis armstrong or , maybe , one direction alum louis tomlinson
even the royal family want a one direction reunion , tweeted one user
prince louis was born on monday morning
he is fifth in line to the throne to succeed great-grandmother queen elizabeth ii
because of a 2013 act of parliament , which removed preference for male heirs , he follows his sister , princess charlotte , in the line of succession
william and catherine have previously picked traditional names with historical echoes for their children
george alexander louis , 4 , may ultimately be britains seventh king george
charlotte elizabeth diana , 2 , was named after her grandfather prince charles , her great-grandmother elizabeth and her late grandmother diana
so it was unsurprising that conventional names were the favorites of the bookies before the latest announcement
the favorites included arthur , alexander , james , albert and philip
in britain , where people can bet on nearly anything , bookmakers take in their biggest hauls for sporting events , such as soccer matches and horse races
but royal events can still attract large numbers of people placing small bets
he said that betting spiked after the baby was born and that bookies take bets right up until the moment of an official announcement , unless they believe someone has inside information
adams said that although on thursday morning the odds on louis were 3-1 , the final odds were 16-1
his agency will pay out about 100,000 pounds ( $ 138,000 ) to people who placed bets on louis
prince louis has been with his parents and relatives at kensington palace since monday evening
if many new parents couldnt quite identify with catherines immaculate looks when she emerged from the hospital just seven hours after giving birth , they could probably feel for william
on thursday , he was seen nodding off during a service at westminster abbey
