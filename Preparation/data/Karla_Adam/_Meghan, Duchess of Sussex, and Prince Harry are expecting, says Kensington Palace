london if one of the top duties of the royal family is to produce heirs , then prince harry and meghan markle , the duke and duchess of sussex , are performing very well , thank you very much
kensington palace announced monday morning that the couple are expecting their first child in the spring of 2019
the american markle has taken to her new job like a seasoned pro
shes poised , shes proper and the queen reportedly loves her
the ginger-haired prince harry , 34 , is the grandson of queen elizabeth ii
markle , 37 , is a former actress
their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of sussex are very pleased to announce that the duchess of sussex is expecting a baby in the spring of 2019
their child , seventh in the line of succession , will be a great-grandchild of the queen and the duke of edinburgh
with prince charles , prince william , prince george , princess charlotte , prince louis and prince harry ahead in the line of succession , it is unlikely given modern medicine and house of windsor life spans that the baby will ever be monarch
but forget the throne the arrival of meghan and harrys kid will be huge news come march or april
a spokeswoman for kensington palace said the duchess is in good health.
reaction on social media was instantaneous and giddy
within minutes of the announcement , royalbaby was trending worldwide
woody johnson , the u.s. ambassador to the united kingdom , tweeted , happy news to wake up to on a monday morning.
many tweets were congratulatory , others inquisitive
some wondered whether the baby would be american or british or both
some hoped they might get the birthday off britons still fondly recall that they got an extra holiday for the nuptials of prince william and kate middleton , now the duchess of cambridge
in britain , you can bet on almost anything , and bookies were quick off the mark to suggest possible names for the newest royal
opening odds on name of harry & meghans baby , announced the bookmaker ladbrokes , which listed victoria , albert , arthur and diana as favorite names
the couple touched down monday morning in sydney for a 16-day tour that begins in australia their first official royal tour
the trip follows in the tradition of harrys parents , prince charles and diana , princess of wales , whose first royal tour was to australia and new zealand
after touching down on aussie soil today will be a lay-day for the royal couple to sleep off jet lag - official duties kick off tomorrow with 76 engagements over the next 16 days and well be across every moment
speculation about a possible pregnancy mounted when the royal couple emerged from their qantas flight from london
markle held several large purple folders in front of her the type of materials that might otherwise be handled by an aide
the trip is their first overseas as a married couple and includes the other part of their job performing engagements and supporting good works
since the wedding , the couple well , lets be honest , mostly just markle has been subjected to maximum scrutiny
the tabloids actually employ lip readers , most recently to try ( unsuccessfully ) to suss out what meghan said to harry when she appeared to give him a gentle reproach at the weekend wedding of princess eugenie and tequila salesman/commoner jack brooksbank
when markle , attending her first solo engagement , was caught on camera closing her own ( chauffeured ) car door , the british press wigged out a little as it pondered whether she violated royal protocol
until further investigation revealed footage of kate middleton doing the same thing
so , basically , never mind
markle also brought much attention to her first solo project as a royal she helped to launch together our community cookbook , a charity cookbook with proceeds supporting victims of the grenfell tower fire tragedy
the book quickly became a bestseller
the mixed-race american divorce actress is generally viewed as just what the royal family needed and she is also seen as keeping harry on his toes
the single asterisk has been the markle family
markles father thomas famously did not attend the wedding ceremony after going to the trouble of posing for paparazzi pics citing ill health
harrys dad prince charles escorted markle down the aisle instead
since then , thomas markle has given paid interviews that have raised royal-watcher eyebrows , saying in one that his daughter would be nothing without me and that i made her the duchess she is today.
markles half-siblings , too , have made a spot of news
samantha markle , for one , compared prince harry to a ginger hamster and has called her younger sibling narcissistic and selfish , in part because the duchess has kept her at arms length
so , that kind of family
