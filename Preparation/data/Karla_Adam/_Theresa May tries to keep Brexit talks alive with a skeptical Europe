london brexit is seriously stuck
nobody really wants britain to crash out of the european union without a withdrawal deal , but time is running out and the sides have bogged down over the contentious issue of how to manage the irish border
prime minister theresa may traveled to brussels on wednesday and was given 30 minutes behind closed doors to make another appeal to her european counterparts
what the europeans wanted to hear was more compromise
said catherine barnard , professor of e.u
law at cambridge university
to ensure an open border a stipulation of the 1998 good friday agreement that brought an end to 30 years of sectarian violence european negotiators have proposed that northern ireland continue to trade as a member of europes customs union
such an arrangement is anathema to unionists in belfast and to may , who says it would cut northern ireland off from the united kingdom
may has proposed instead that the whole of the united kingdom remain aligned with the customs union for a limited time
but that idea has been shot down by europes chief negotiator , irelands prime minister and members of her own party , who want the ability to do trade deals with the rest of the world
the torys chief whip told may on tuesday that parliament would vote it down
nonetheless , when may addressed parliament on wednesday , she insisted that her compromise proposals were not dead
may is also reportedly open to extending the brexit transition period by a year so instead of 21 months , as previously agreed , britain would have 33 months , or until the end of 2021 to leave the bloc
but european parliament president antonio tajani said may did not offer any substantial new element in her brussels appeal
afterward , she left the dinner so that leaders of the remaining 27 e.u
member states could discuss britains fate among themselves
the summit had been billed as a moment of truth , when a deal must be finalized to allow an orderly exit by britain on march 29
but the moment of truth has been delayed
european leaders are now discussing another summit in november or even december before the holidays to secure a possible accord
like may , european leaders continue to express confidence a deal can be struck even as they are growing fearful of an unruly separation
arriving in brussels , german chancellor angela merkel echoed the european line that 90 percent of the withdrawal agreement was settled
but in an address to the german parliament earlier wednesday , merkel revealed that her government was stepping up contingency planning in the event that britain leaves with no deal
merkel told german lawmakers , according to the guardian
but the french government also published a draft of emergency legislation that would require britons to secure visas to visit france if britain leaves the european union with no deal
in a speech in london on tuesday evening , john major , a former conservative prime minister , said the brexit vote was a colossal misjudgment and that brexit-backers sold the country a fantasy and would not be forgiven
