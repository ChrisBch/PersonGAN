bristol , england arron banks sipped his milky tea and patiently explained to an american journalist that he really doesnt give a hoot
he didnt say hoot , of course
he was much more profane
the 52-year-old millionaire insurance mogul with a passion for off-road car rallies around kenya , endless gin and tonics , and brexit politician nigel farage was the main bankroller of the renegade 2016 campaign for britain to leave the european union
that campaign made him the largest political donor in british history and he made history because his side won
all a witch hunt , banks says
u.s. congressional investigators are now in possession of thousands of emails and texts generated by banks and his brexiteers documents that were stolen , says banks documents that were leaked by whistleblowers , say british journalists
bring it on , banks says
he lives in a much smaller farmhouse down the road
he yanked off his necktie
he smoked a ciggy
never mind his cardiologist , who scrawled lifestyle on his medical report
the clubby , moneyed , wily , cricket-mad conservative compares his insurgency , favorably , to the viet cong
he admires guerrillas , disrupters and president trump
banks told the washington post he did indeed meet with the russian ambassador in london at least four times
they got drunk together
the ambassador tried to hook banks up with a deal to consolidate russian gold mines
later the russians dangled a diamond deal
so what
he took a look , he said
hes a businessman , after all
he has a stake in diamond mines in south africa and a uranium mine in niger
but , he insists , he didnt do any deals with the russians no gold , no diamonds
banks said he would be happy to appear before the u.s. house , if invited
he seems one of those rare individuals who enjoys the theater of appearing before select committees
when he and his business partner , sidekick and brexit spokesman andy wigmore , were recently grilled by british lawmakers as part of an investigation into fake news , it was must-watch television for political nerds
the duo kicked off the session by asking committee chair damian collins if hed like to recuse himself because he had accepted tickets to a chelsea soccer match the club is owned by the russian billionaire oligarch roman abramovich
nice try , said collins , who gave as good as he got
the session came to a halt when the duo walked out
they were asked to stay for five more minutes to finish , but banks said they were late for lunch
you can join us if you want , wigmore told lawmakers
banks has been to trump tower with farage and wigmore
they were the first foreign delegation to get a meeting with the president-elect in november 2016
wigmore , whom bank affectionately calls the worst pr man in london , said he believes trump will turn out to be the greatest president in american history.
banks nodded his head , yes
collins , who has been investigating the kremlins political interference for thepast two years , said the russian style is to reach out to fellow travelers with shared worldviews they see a person who is disrupter and try to help that person along
banks is a student of trump speeches , which display a kind of genius of repetition , he says , a classic propaganda tool
low-energy jeb.
its what sticks in peoples minds , banks said
banks said they tried to mimic trumps style in the brexit campaign
like trump , banks is a super tweeter , an online duelist and a serious troll
for example , he dismisses reporter carole cadwalladr of the observer newspaper who has published major scoops on banks , cambridge analytica and russian influence as the sad cat lady who is obsessed with him
this sort of stuff seems to goose banks on
he loves to play head games with journalists and goads prime minister theresa mays government to deliver the definitive , hard , cleaving brexit that he says voters voted for
his russian wife , katya , a former gymnast and model , showed up in the rose garden with three of their five dogs
she had russian cousins in tow
watch that one hes a nipper , banks warned of the dachshund
katya was involved in a complex british-russian scandal that made the news in 2010 and that never really came to anything but in banks style , their big range rovers in the drive now sport license plates reading kbii spy and x mi5 spy
few people in the british political class knew who banks was in 2014
his father ran farms in south africa
banks didnt go to university
then he said hed give 100,000 pounds to the u.k
independence party ( ukip ) , the anti-immigrant , make britain great again party , dismissed by tories as a bunch of whack jobs and racists who could barely win a seat in parliament
when william hague , then the leader of the house of commons , sniffed that hed never heard of this arron banks character , the insurance magnate told farage to make his donation a million pounds
combined with brexit , banks said he gave $ 13 million
he insists it was all his money not russias
bankss book , written in the aftermath of the historic vote , is a loose diary a self-serving , funny , self-depreciating , humble-bragging insiders account
many paragraphs begin
ten g & ts later
before i got too squiffy
amid the alcohol joviality
the books ghost writer , british political journalist isabel oakeshott ( whose emails were the ones that went missing ) , concluded that banks and wigmore were shamelessly used by the russians in a classic russian fishing expedition.
we asked banks about that
he called the assessment harsh and explained that he and farage and wigmore were worried enough about the accusation that they briefed american diplomats on their russian contacts so as not to embarrass trump
would banks meet trump when he comes to england later this month
we wouldnt say no , banks answered
wigmore joked , tell them were not radioactive
