london the crisis ravaging facebook started when a young researcher , regretful over his role in turning data on an estimated tens of millions of u.s. voters into a high-tech political persuasion machine , decided to come forward with his story
and he imagined that facebook , whose user profiles were part of that effort , could be a partner in helping to exhume this painful truth and perhaps embrace some changes to its privacy policy
what happened instead , he said , was an own goal a soccer term for a self-inflicted wound by facebook
he also described previously unreported contact with corey lewandowski , trumps first campaign manager , in spring 2015
( lewandowski denied any contact )
and wylie shared his suspicion though unconfirmed that data collected and used by cambridge analytica may have fallen into russian hands
but wylie spoke with particular passion about his own feelings of guilt for helping to develop an advanced new form of political targeting that was used by people whose conservative politics are the opposite of his own
some say that wylie is a flawed whistleblower , that he never should have helped collect data on tens of millions of facebook users and should not have waited years to publicly reveal his misgivings about working for cambridge analytica
but he says hes trying to make matters right by speaking out now
wylie , a canadian citizen , moved to london in 2010 and started to work in 2013 for scl group , which he said conducted information operations around the world and also worked on campaigns , especially in africa
as research director , wylie helped that company give birth to cambridge analytica as an american brand that would focus on u.s. politics with at least $ 10 million from billionaire hedge fund manager robert mercer
the cambridge analytica office was in the posh mayfair neighborhood of london , and the dozens of young workers many of them contractors , a number of whom were from eastern europe buzzed about with apple laptops
at the helm , said wylie , was mercers daughter rebekah , who was president , and conservative strategist stephen k. bannon , who was vice president
running day-to-day operations was a smooth-talking upper-crust briton , alexander nix
nix did not respond to requests for comment on wednesday
cambridge analytica suspended nix on tuesday after a british television sting showed him on secret recordings talking about employing unethical tactics to win elections , including bribery and using sex workers for honey pots.
wylie said he helped set up the television stations sting
wylie said that it was under nixs direction but with the knowledge of bannon and rebekah mercer that cambridge analytica began an ambitious data-gathering program that included tapping into the facebook profiles of 50 million users through the use of a personality-testing app
the company did that with the help of a russian american psychologist at cambridge university , aleksandr kogan , who also made regular visits back to russia , wylie said
wylie said he and others at cambridge analytica were initially skeptical of the power of this tactic for gathering data
but when the company approved $ 1,000 for kogan to experiment with his app , he produced data on 1,000 people who downloaded it and roughly 160,000 of their friends all in a matter of hours
they soon married that data with voter lists and commercial data broker information and discovered they had a remarkably precise portrait of a large swath of the american electorate
kogans app , called thisisyourdigitallife and portrayed as being for research purposes , gathered data on the 270,000 people who downloaded it and tens of millions of their facebook friends
it was this data and others that wylie later worried might have ended up in russian hands
wylie said , referring to the russian presidents official residence
but he said that he and others affiliated with cambridge analytica briefed lukoil , a russian oil company , on its research into american voters
he said kogan also made regular visits to russia but acknowledged that he did not know what kogan did there
for wylie , a data scientist with an avid interest in politics and culture , the collection of facebook and other data did not initially trouble him
the social media platform made such data grabs easy for app developers though it began severely restricting them in 2015 and wylie saw it as a powerful way to study an entire nation on a scale at once broad and precise
combined with other data , cambridge analytica hoped to profile the entire american electorate something it already had done in other countries and determine what pitches would work best for each individual voter
the project also appeared to excite its benefactors
but wylie and others clashed with nix , whom he called a bully.
wylie also grew weary of the increasingly far-right tenor of the politics the researchers were helping to propel
they discovered and refined potent themes about keeping out immigrants , draining the swamp and restoring an earlier era of national greatness as understood mainly to mean for white american men
when wylie told nix at a london coffee shop in 2014 that he was going to leave at the end of the year , he heard a boast that at the time sounded ridiculous but , in retrospect , haunted him
but it was not clear to wylie at that point who might lead such an eventual white house bid
in fact , cambridge analytica worked with sen. ted cruz ( r-tex )
during the presidential primary before signing on with the trump campaign
months after he and several other cambridge analytica employees quit the firm , they got a mysterious message from somebody purporting to represent the trump organization
wylie and others , unfamiliar with trumps brewing political ambitions , thought they might find themselves somehow involved in trumps apprentice reality television show
wylie said he ended up speaking with lewandowski , trumps first campaign manager , in conference calls in which lewandowski reportedly described a forthcoming trump run for president
lewandowski later met in person with several of wylies former cambridge analytica colleagues at trump tower in spring 2015 , wylie said in an account backed by one of those people who did attend
but the plan to work for the campaign doing voter analysis fizzled , in large part because the mostly liberal former cambridge analytica employees didnt want to wade back into conservative politics
lewandowski said the campaign had been pitched by cambridge analytica but never hired them and had no recollection of meeting with any former employees.
ive never heard of those guys , lewandowski said of wylie and the other former employees.
it didnt happen.
but the brief flirtation did have a concrete consequence
scl group threatened legal action against wylie for supposedly violating a noncompete clause he signed before quitting
wylie was confused he had no idea that the company considered trump a client or potential client and began to suspect that he had been set up
to resolve the legal dispute , he signed a nondisclosure agreement that would later complicate his efforts to speak out about the work he had done for cambridge analytica
wylies sense of uneasiness about that work began building when he heard trump , in 2016 , start using themes that cambridge analytica had developed in 2014 about building walls and draining the swamp
more than most , wylie knew the science behind why they might be effective
his discomfort grew when bannon formally joined the trump campaign in august 2016
election results on nov. 8 , 2016 , filled wylie with a profound sense of dread
a friend who worked on the campaign of democratic nominee hillary clinton and was familiar with wylies previous work sent him a message saying , what did you do
it hit home at the inauguration.
it is unclear how much cambridge analytica contributed to trumps win
soon after trumps inauguration , wylie began talking with observer of london reporter carole cadwalladr , who had been working on stories about cambridge analytica
he also retained an attorney , tamsin allen , and began working directly with britains information commissioners office , which started an investigation into cambridge analytica
earlier this month , wylie received a sharply worded letter from facebook , which demanded access to his smartphone and computer
he refused , saying that he already had shared information with the british authorities and saw no reason to do so with a private company especially one whose own activities might be called into question
it was not wylies first encounter with facebook
the company had sent a letter in august 2016 saying that kogan , the cambridge researcher , should not have shared the data of facebook users
downloading names , home towns , work histories and likes of 50 million users was not against the rules at least in 2014 but kogan should not have transferred the data to cambridge analytica , facebook wrote
facebook wanted the data destroyed
wylie said he complied with that request , though he does not know if kogan or cambridge analytica did
( cambridge analytica has issued several statements in recent days denying any wrongdoing )
silicon valley-based facebook posted a blog friday evening early saturday morning in london announcing the suspension of kogan , wylie and the parent company of cambridge analytica
when he was awakened by a call around 3 a.m. from a reporter , wylie was furious at facebook for acting unilaterally and accusing him of misdeeds when he had come forward to authorities
days later , he still is
wylies career as facebook critic quickly moved to a new level
lawmakers in the united states and europe began demanding that facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg personally explain how the data of 50 million users reached a mysterious company with ties to bannon , the mercers and trump
state attorneys general began investigating
so did the federal trade commission over concerns that facebook had violated a 2011 consent decree over privacy issues
when told that wylie thought he had been mistreated by facebook , the social media company responded that cambridge analytica and kogan had agreed to an audit of their servers and systems.
mr. wylie thus far has declined.
facebook on wednesday said it would conduct audits of thousands of apps in response to the breach of trust caused by cambridge analytica
wylie said , referring to the information commissioners office.
im not going to be bullied by facebook.
as for the broader issues the privacy intrusions of the data collection , the manipulation of voters , the possible role in electing trump , the possibility that cambridge analyticas work might have reached russians wylie feels remorse
wylie says he wants to expose the machinations of data gathering for political purposes as fully as hes able
he dreams of resuming his work as a data scientist some day
for now , he is something like a full-time whistleblower
in an emotional moment on tuesday night at the frontline club , a journalists club in london , wylie told a packed audience said that his decision to step forward was about taking responsibility
im on my first step.
