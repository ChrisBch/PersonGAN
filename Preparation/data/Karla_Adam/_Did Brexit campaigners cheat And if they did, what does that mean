london if he knocked on your door , shahmir sanni might not be what you would expect of a campaigner for brexit , britains historic now wrenching , all-consuming decision to leave the european union
sanni is a young , hip , gay muslim , a pakistani briton who studied economics at his university , loves fashion and is an american-style libertarian , a committed euroskeptic.
he does not want less immigration to britain he wants more
but he wants london , not brussels , to be in control
he describes himself as sassy.
the week-long controversy over who did what and how in the 2016 brexit vote quickly ensnared prime minister theresa may and her inner circle
one of mays senior aides at 10 downing street , stephen parkinson , was a top brexit campaigner
he is also sannis former boyfriend and is accused of publicly outing sanni as gay
sanni branded it revenge , an attempt to silence him
he said his outing could endanger family members in pakistan , where sanni said homosexuality remains taboo , especially in conservative circles
he had to rush to come out to his mother , who lives in london.
the worst day of my life , he told the washington post
parkinson said the revelation was exculpatory and necessary
in his statement , he said he did nothing wrong and only advised sanni as a friend , not as a co-campaigner
may defended her aide in parliament , stressing that his statement was personal , though the email sent to reporters by mays press office included a subject line with the word official in capital letters
the accusation of questionable campaign coordination and spending has been dismissed as a lovers quarrel and a total nothingburger
it has also been hyped as a bombshell that calls into question not only the decision to leave the european union , but also britains fair play and democratic values
sanni and grimes were both 22 , and this was their first political campaign
they did outreach but had limited numbers of online followers and email addresses of supporters
sanni said that after he was instructed to set up a bank account , beleave learned it would be getting a donation of $ 878,000 via the vote leave organization , which was running up against campaign spending limits
however , the money never went into the beleave account , sanni said
instead , he said , it went directly to aggregate iq to blast voters in the last week of the campaign with targeted messages on social media
aggregate iq was doing similar work for the vote leave campaign , according to campaign finance reports first published by buzzfeed in the aftermath of the referendum
wylie told parliament
in statements , aggregate iq said it did nothing wrong and had followed the law
vote leaves campaign director , dominic cummings , declined an interview request , but on his blog , he wrote that the whistleblowers had promised watergate and delivered a dodgy zoolander.
johnson , the foreign secretary , called accusations of illegal coordination utterly ludicrous.
vote leave won fair and square and legally , johnson tweeted
in debate in parliament , lawmakers were divided over alleged breaches of electoral law
labour lawmaker ben bradshaw said that when he began raising concerns about the brexit vote , he was considered a crank.
but now , he said , almost all of his allegations have proven to be correct.
concluding the debate , government minister chloe smith said she would not comment on allegations that are under investigation
she added that the electoral commission , the official watchdog , had concluded that the brexit vote was delivered without any major issues and that the government would implement the results
political analysts said the accusations of financial cheating will be a boost to the pro-europeans keen to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the brexit referendum , in which britons voted 52 percent to 48 percent in favor of leaving the european union
he said claims that the brexit vote may have been won through fraud were probably overstating the case
