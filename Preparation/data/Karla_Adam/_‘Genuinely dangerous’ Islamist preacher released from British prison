london islamist preacher anjem choudary was released from prison friday , prompting concerns that his new freedom could spark extremist activity
described by britains prison minister as genuinely dangerous , choudary , 51 , was jailed in 2016 for encouraging support for the islamic state
he was automatically eligible for release after serving half of his prison sentence and will be subject to a number of restrictions during the remainder of his sentence
he wont be able to travel outside of london without permission , and he will have to wear a gps-enabled electronic tag
if he breaches any of his conditions , he could be recalled to prison
not one to shy away from the media , choudary emerged from his bail hostel briefly on friday to wave and smile at the throng of journalists outside
but in keeping with his control measures , he didnt talk to the press
anjem choudary comes out of his bail hostel to greet the media he always liked to see
he ca n't speak , mind
but even with restrictions in place , some argue that his release could spur renewed support for islamist extremists as well as energize anti-islam activists like tommy robinson , for whom choudary has long been a target
said nick ryan , a spokesman for hope not hate , an anti-fascist research group
ryan described the relationship between supporters of choudary and robinson as one that was mutually beneficial.
robinson whose real name is stephen lennon is the founder of the far-right english defense league and was recently released from prison on bail
he faces a hearing next week that could see him return to prison for contempt of court
hope not hate wrote in a report titled the return of the terrorist ringmaster.
according to the group , choudary has been linked to at least 123 islamist terrorists
others have argued its important not to overstate his influence
for his part , choudary has always denied that he is responsible for acts of violence
indeed , for years the trained lawyer seemed particularly savvy at staying just on the right side of the law
but in 2016 , he was sentenced alongside co-defendant mohammed rahman to five-and-a-half years in prison
rahman is expected to be released next week
other supporters of choudarys have also been released recently
said the henry jackson society , in a briefing note on his release
earlier this week , the united nations placed choudary on a sanctions list , meaning he is subject to an asset freeze and travel ban
