london the daughter of a former russian double agent who was poisoned alongside her father is awake and alert , stoking hopes that she could offer details crucial to cracking a case that has inflamed diplomatic tensions between moscow and the west
the condition of yulia skripal , 33 , who was poisoned by a military-grade nerve agent , is rapidly improving , doctors said
her father , sergei skripal , 66 , who was also poisoned , remains in critical but stable condition
the bbc , citing multiple sources , said she was conscious and conversing , raising hopes that , as a key witness , she may be able to offer valuable intelligence that could help identify her would-be assassins
skripals improved condition follows the announcement this week that the united states , one of more than two dozen countries to expel russian diplomats in retaliation for the poisoning , would kick out 60 russians and close the russian consulate in seattle
russia responded by expelling 60 u.s. diplomats and closing the u.s. consulate in st. petersburg
on friday , russias foreign ministry summoned ambassadors from dozens of countries to inform them of further tit-for-tat expulsions
it was unclear what , if anything , yulia skripal would remember in the lead-up to the events on march 4 , when she and her father were found slumped on a park bench in the quiet english city of salisbury
the two were exposed to novichok , a rare nerve agent developed by the soviet union , british authorities said
investigators said the main concentration of the nerve agent was found on the front door of the skripal home , which remains cordoned off
in 2006 , skripal was jailed by russia for selling information to mi6 , britains foreign intelligence service
he was released four years later as part of a high-profile spy swap
britain says it is highly likely that russia is responsible for the poisoning
russia denies any wrongdoing
earlier this week , sergei skripals niece , viktoria skripal , told the bbc that she had little hope her relatives would survive
she also said that the family has not told sergeis mother about the attack.
our first priority was to protect our granny , she said
