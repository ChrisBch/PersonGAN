as of friday evening , authorities had given no details on possible suspects
security measures were tightened across london 's vast mass-transit network , and the government described the threat level as critical , meaning another attack could be imminent
british media reported that the crude explosive device , carried in a bucket and shoved into a shopping bag , had a timer , suggesting that some degree of bombmaking knowledge was employed
the islamic state terrorist group asserted responsibility for the explosion on its amaq news agency website
experts cautioned that the group often seeks credit for attacks it may have only inspired , as well as ones it had nothing to do with
the explosion on london 's tube is bound to rekindle pointed debate about whether countries such as britain have been tough enough in fighting terrorism
just hours after the blast , president trump suggested that britain needed to be more proactive
shortly after , prime minister theresa may retorted that such criticism was not helpful
this was a device intended to cause significant harm , may said , but it remained unclear whether the explosive may have detonated prematurely or malfunctioned at the parsons green station , about three miles southwest of central london
it was not certain whether the bomber was among those hurt or was now on the run
in a sign that a manhunt could be mobilized , london police appealed to the public to submit cellphone images taken at the scene
british media said that investigators had images of a suspect from closed-circuit television
the homemade device blew up on the inbound train , nine stops from westminster , the seat of the british government
after the attack , trump tweeted another attack in london by a loser terrorist
these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of scotland yard
must be proactive
it was unclear whether trump had been briefed by his security advisers and knew something of the identity of the assailants
at the time , neither the london police nor the british government had said anything publicly beyond describing the detonation as a suspected terrorist attack
following trump 's tweets , and without mentioning the american president by name , may said that it 's not helpful for anybody to speculate on
an ongoing investigation
later , during a brief appearance outside the white house , trump further hammered a hard-line message , saying we have to be very smart and we have to be very , very tough perhaps we 're not nearly tough enough
during a tumultuous election campaign that was interrupted by two terrorist attacks , the british prime minister repeatedly promised harsh new measures
may vowed that if human rights laws get in the way of protecting britain , she would change those laws
at the time , experts wondered whether may 's tough talk could be matched by more action in a country considered one of the world 's most proactive on counterterrorism
the threat is now so diffuse that it is unclear how those measures could be more effectively used to prevent future attacks , said raffaello pantucci , director of the international security studies group at the royal united services institute in london
one of the few possibilities would be to impose harsher sentences for terror-related offenses , and that is certainly something being considered
there are only so many things you can do , though , he said
i do n't think britons would want to have armed police officers on every street corner
shortly after the explosion , the right-wing , populist u.k
independence party , or ukip , tweeted , thank goodness nobody serious hurt at parsonsgreen but we can not rely on jihadist incompetence
authorities said the 29 injured largely suffered from flash burns
emergency services said none of those hurt had life-threatening injuries
we have hundreds of detectives involved looking at closed-circuit tv , forensic work and speaking to witnesses , said mark rowley , head of london 's police counterterrorism unit
britains prime minister not helpful to speculate on probe
parsons green is in fulham , a neighborhood of victorian rowhouses and leafy parks known for its furniture designers and champions league soccer
witnesses described a fireball and smoke racing through the subway car , and then a frantic crush of people trying to flee while others attempted to aid those with burns and other injuries
luke walmsley , 33 , a film editor , was on his way to work during a normal morning commute , listening to music
and then things were suddenly not normal
i heard a scream and then there was a flash , a light and smoke
i actually pulled my earplugs out , and then the screams got louder and louder , he said , recalling people running toward him at the station
it was chaos
it was every man for himself to get down the stairs , and it 's a very tight exit , he said , describing injured people on the ground
i went back to see if they were okay
other people attended them , then there were nannies and moms asking where their children were
he said people were helping others who were shocked and burned , bottles of water being poured over burns , quite severe burns , whole legs
british prime minister takes terrorism fight to cyberspace
in the months since may 's narrow reelection , her government has come up with few new security proposals
cities have invested in erecting barriers or bollards to make it harder for terrorists to attack popular public spaces
earlier this week , london police deployed for the first time new high-tech nets laced with tungsten-steel spurs that can be placed on roadways to stop marauding vehicles as heavy as a double-decker bus
this volatility means that the authorities have to intervene a lot earlier
friday 's explosion was the fifth terrorist attack in britain this year
at least three of the attackers who struck britain this year were previously known to law enforcement officials
authorities have acknowledged that it is impossible to keep track of all suspects , and it is believed that british security services are constantly monitoring about 500 people
according to european union officials , the number of islamist extremists in the country could be up to 50 times that
after june attacks in london , trump picked a fight with the citys mayor
lauren hubbard , 24 , had just stepped on the tube at parsons green the beginning of her morning commute to her job in the financial district when she felt intense heat
then she saw flames barreling toward her
i could see the fire , she said
i could feel the heat of it
at first you just panic , then you just run
kate llewellyn-jones , 42 , who lives next to the station , said she heard shouting and then a woman ran into her yard
she had lost her shoes in the stampede
this thought struck many why attack here
parsons green is not a tourist magnet but a leafy enclave
it feels very far away from the center , llewellyn-jones said
citing london attack , trump calls for expanded u.s. travel bans
after the recent spate of attacks in london and manchester , the british prime minister was criticized by the opposition for slashing local police staffs
on thursday , britain 's home office announced that police , using broader authorities , had arrested a record 379 people for terrorism-related offenses in the past months , an increase of almost 70 percent
