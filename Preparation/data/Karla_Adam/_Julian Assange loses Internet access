london julian assange , the controversial founder of wikileaks , has been barred from using the internet at the ecuadoran embassy in london , where he has been holed up for nearly six years , the ecuadoran government announced
it was not immediately clear whether visitors would also be stopped
the statement said
ecuador did not cite any examples of this alleged breach
assange strongly supported separatist leaders in spains catalonia region who sought to secede last year
the head of that movement , carles puigdemont , the former regional president of catalonia , was arrested over the weekend in germany
spanish authorities seek his extradition and return to madrid , where he faces possible charges of treason and misuse of public funds

sources close to assange revealed that the document he signed does not specifically address his tweeting and advocacy
instead , assange agreed to comply with article 41 of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations of 1961 , which states
a wikileaks source , who declined to be named because communications with assange have been cut off , said assange signed the document when ecuador was considering making him a diplomat , with all the protections that would imply
such a move was not taken
instead , wikileaks supporters say assange sought refuge as a free-speech advocate who now finds his speech muzzled
assange , however , specifically sought refuge at the ecuadoran embassy , located in one of londons most exclusive neighborhoods , in 2012 to avoid extradition to sweden , where he was wanted for questioning about alleged sex crimes
assange has denied the allegations
swedish authorities have since shelved their investigation on grounds they could not get access to him
earlier this year , assange lost two legal bids to quash a british arrest warrant issued after he skipped bail and fled to the embassy
assange has expressed fears that if he leaves the embassy , he will be arrested and extradited to the united states for questioning over wikileakss role in publishing a trove of classified u.s. documents
assange was granted ecuadoran citizenship late last year , and the government said it has protected him
in its communique wednesday , the south american nation seemed to be saying enough was enough

yanis varoufakis , a former greek minister , and brian eno , a british musician and record producer , said they had great concern when they heard assange has lost access to the internet and reportedly was no longer allowed to receive visitors
they wrote in a statement
this is not the first time his hosts have cut off his access to the internet
in october 2016 , the embassy temporarily denied assange internet access out of concern wikileaks was interfering in the u.s. presidential election
in the summer of 2016 , the anti-secrecy site published hacked emails from the democratic national committee

the ecuadoran government said it cut off assanges internet on tuesday
in his latest tweets , posted tuesday , assange responded to an insult by foreign office minister alan duncan
in a debate in parliament , duncan called assange a miserable little worm who should hand himself over to british authorities to face justice
