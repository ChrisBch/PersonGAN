london the u.k
for ukip supporters , their best day was in june 2016 when britain surprised the world , and itself , by voting to exit the european bloc
led then by donald trump ally , talk radio host and arch-euroskeptic nigel farage , they fashioned themselves the bad boys of brexit
it was fun down at the pub while it lasted
every day since , their victory has been worse
a founder of the populist movement just penned a column in the guardian newspaper calling ukip a national joke and saying it should be disbanded
the tabloids are having a field day
the right-wing party that once stirred panic among conservative party leaders and goaded then-prime minister david cameron into calling for the brexit referendum finds itself imploding , again
on monday , after a dozen ukip leaders resigned or defected in protest , british reporters staked out the hotel where bolton was hunkered down
bolton emerged and vowed not to resign his unpaid post , promising instead to force a vote among the dwindling general membership at a gathering next month made more challenging , bolton conceded , because the party is out of money
it is now time to put an end to the factional infighting within the party and to remove those who have been a part of that
in a single phrase , it is time to 'drain the swamp , said bolton , lifting a trump campaign line
if ukip collapses , what happens to its voters
the party was built on an anti-europe , anti-immigrant , anti-establishment platform and those sentiments are alive and well in britain
the party may be seen as a joke , but the movement has been popular
past party manifestos have called for lowering the taxes on british beer , limiting the number of foreign players on british soccer teams and capping net immigration at zero
it 's an open question , where do the ukip voters go
said tim bale , a professor of politics at queen mary university of london
some might be captured by the conservative party , but the tories are undeniably part of the establishment , he said
bale guessed that a few could side with labour
but many may drift away from voting altogether , he said
the ukip chief had a bad couple of weeks
first there was this from the sun tabloid phewkip
ukip leader henry bolton , 54 , ditches wife for topless glamour model who 's nearly half his age
soon after , the daily mail revealed a string of racist private texts by bolton 's girlfriend about markle , worrying whether prince harry 's black american fiancee and her seed will taint our royal family
markle 's father is white and her mother is black
marney , who is in her 20s , apologized for her comments
the party has lurched from one crisis to another since brexit
ukip has a fundamental structural problem , said rob ford , author of revolt on the right , a book on the rise of the populist party
they have been deprived of a unifying cause , and they have been deprived of a unifying figure
for ukip supporters , farage was a kind of messiah and a hard act to follow , he added
farage is a flamboyant if controversial politician who was often pictured down at the pub , pint in hand
under his leadership , ukip played an instrumental role in securing the brexit referendum
but having delivered on its main goal , the party has struggled to find new purpose
in the 2015 general election , it got almost 4 million votes
in the 2017 election , it received fewer than 600,000 votes
even so , writing ukip 's obituary may be premature
true , it has had five leaders in 16 months
but it is tapping into a niche electorate , analysts say
there is still a market , politically , for the kind of politics in britain that ukip has come to epitomize nationalist , anti-immigration , socially conservative , opposed to the gradual shift to a liberal multicultural society , ford said
when the ink dries on the brexit deal , the day after , people will start to be unhappy with the brexit deal , he said
but can ukip in any form survive long enough to reach that point
who knows
speaking on his london talk radio show , farage said i do just wonder to myself , if ukip finishes up having yet another leadership election whether it can actually survive that
bolton , who once boasted he could kill a badger with his bare hands , will now see if he can rally his grass roots
