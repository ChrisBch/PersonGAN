london after a five-hour meeting with her cabinet , and months of struggle and delay , prime minister theresa may emerged from 10 downing street on wednesday and announced that her ministers had approved her brexit plan
the draft agreement , negotiated by british and european union officials , is a decisive step toward finalizing britains departure from the european union in march
the agreement also promises a solution to the knotty challenge of avoiding a hard border between northern ireland , which is part of the united kingdom , and the irish republic , which will remain in the e.u
the cabinet approval of mays package marked the end of a remarkable 24 hours in british politics a true cliffhanger , with social media and the airwaves filled with speculation about whether the deal , and may herself , would survive
even as may prepared to speak , british political reporters were tweeting that a challenge to her leadership might be underway
the prime minister looked exhausted as she faced the cameras wednesday evening outside her official residence
rather than celebrate a hard-won round in her fight for a workable brexit deal , she sounded somber
may said , without elaborating on the details of the deal
may said the brexit withdrawal agreement will protect jobs and preserve the united kingdom
she did not say that it would make britain great again
the withdrawal agreement was published shortly after she spoke 585 pages of e.u
may will discuss it in parliament on thursday
for the past two years , the greatest debate over brexit has not been waged between brussels and london , but within mays fractious conservative party
hard-line brexiteers have pushed for a decisive split from european bureaucrats and courts , from e.u
rules and regulations , while others , led by may , have sought a softer brexit , a compromise package that keeps britain more closely aligned with europe to better protect the british economy
may got a taste of the disgruntlement of her own backbench on wednesday , as fellow conservative party members heaped derision on a deal that they had not yet seen but that they feared gave too much away
a conservative member of parliament who opposes brexit , anna soubry , said wednesday that british voters should be offered another chance to cast a ballot on whether to support mays deal or remain in the european union
the best deal , soubry told the bbc , is the deal that we currently have with the european union.
sammy wilson , a member of parliament for northern irelands democratic unionist party ( dup ) , which may needs to prop up her minority government , told talkradio that mays plan is not so much a deal as a double-cross.
outside parliament , nigel farage , a top brexit campaigner and a member of the european parliament , called mays withdrawal agreement the worst deal in history.
in europe , there was relief that may had won approval from her divided cabinet
he said european leaders had been united after what he described as britains thunderclap decision to leave the european union and took pains not to inflame mays sticky political situation in london
but he confirmed that if negotiators fail to reach a second deal about britains future relationship with the e.u
in the coming two years , a fail-safe , politically painful insurance policy would kick in to prevent a border from springing up between ireland and northern ireland
that insurance plan would keep britain bound inside the e.u
customs zone , obeying e.u
customs rules and regulations but unable to shape them the exact opposite of the stated goal of brexit advocates
european officials say they , too , find the situation uncomfortable , since britain would have tariff-free and quota-free access to the vast e.u
market without being subject to the same demands as other e.u
hague urged skeptics to consider the big picture.
he told the bbc that the deal fulfills the mandate the british voters chose when they voted 52 percent to 48 percent in a june 2016 referendum to leave the european bloc
