the joint statement was released shortly before londons and moscows envoys to the united nations squared off in an emergency security council meeting called by britain to brief diplomats on the investigation
british ambassador karen pierce methodically outlined evidence that she said pointed to the kremlins complicity in the attack , which occurred march 4 in the quiet english city of salisbury
two russians using the names alexander petrov and ruslan boshirov were charged wednesday in absentia with attempting to murder sergei skripal and his daughter , yulia , with novichok , a military-grade nerve agent
pierce acknowledged the two suspects , who flew back to russia shortly after the attack , can not be extradited under the russian constitution
but she said britain will ask interpol to issue an alert to arrest them if they ever leave russian territory , so they can be tried in britain
what is novichok , the nerve agent identified in the salisbury spy attack
russian ambassador vassily nebenzia calmly twirled a pencil in his hand as pierce , sitting five feet away , spoke
then , with intense scorn , he denied russian involvement in the case , which he ridiculed as an unfounded and mendacious cocktail of facts.
nebenzia sought to diminish the british evidence , saying it defied credulity to conclude that two russians had smuggled novichok to britain in a counterfeit perfume bottle without being poisoned themselves
he questioned the authenticity of camera footage showing the russians arriving at londons gatwick airport
and he dismissed the assertion that the two men worked for russias gru intelligence agency , when the names they used to enter britain are believed to be aliases
he said , according to the english translation of his remarks
he denied that russia had ever developed or deployed novichok and rejected the british contention that russia has refused to cooperate , claiming instead that london had refused moscows offers to help
london needs this story for one purpose , he said.
to unleash disgusting , anti-russian hysteria.
u.s. ambassador nikki haley lauded the british for staging a master class in how to conduct an investigation
sergei skripal , a former gru officer , was convicted in 2006 of sharing state secrets with the british
he was released to britain in a spy swap in 2010
