thanks to everyone who has carried us this far
zaghari-ratcliffe , a project manager with the thomson reuters foundation , was given a five-year jail sentence in 2016 after iranian authorities accused her of spreading propaganda
she and her family deny the charges , saying she was on holiday with her daughter , visiting family in tehran
ratcliffe said they did not know exactly how the release came about , but added britains new foreign secretary , jeremy hunt , was their lucky charm.
hunt who recently replaced boris johnson , who resigned over the governments faltering brexit plans tweeted about the good news but stressed her release should be permanent
really good news that nazanin has been released on furlough , credit to tireless campaigning by husband richard and her friends
but being in prison at all is gross injustice and she must be permanently released for which every effort will continue freenazanin
johnson , while foreign secretary , drew widespread criticism late last year after he said zaghari-ratcliffe was simply teaching people journalism before her arrest a claim her family and employer vehemently deny
johnson later distanced himself from his remarks
