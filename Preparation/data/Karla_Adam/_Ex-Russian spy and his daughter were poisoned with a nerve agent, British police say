london british police said wednesday that a former russian double agent and his daughter who are fighting for their lives in a british hospital were targeted specifically with a nerve agent
said mark rowley , who heads britains counterterrorism policing
rowley also said that a police officer , one of the first on the scene , was in serious condition in hospital
on sunday afternoon , sergei skripal , 66 , and his daughter yulia , 33 , were found unconscious on a bench in the center of salisbury , a cathedral city about 90 miles southwest of london
the two were rushed to a hospital , where they remain critically ill
skripal , a former russian spy , was jailed in 2006 for passing state secrets to britain
he was released in 2010 as part of a high-profile spy swap
the long , terrifying history of russian dissidents being poisoned abroad
police did not specify what nerve agent they think was used or how it was administered
because nerve agents are complex to make , they are typically not made by individuals
said malcolm sperrin , a medical physics expert
the best known nerve agents are vx , absorbable through the skin , and sarin , which tends to be inhaled or ingested
some nerve agents have antidotes , but they need to be administered quickly to be effective
the nerve agent vx killed kim jong nam , the estranged half brother of north korean leader kim jong un
he died last year after a bizarre attack at a malaysian airport in which vx was smeared on his face
in april 2017 , sarin was used to kill more than 80 people in the syrian town of khan sheikhoun
british police stressed wednesday that there was a low risk to the wider public in connection with the salisbury incident but added that specialist officers in protective clothing would be continuing their work in the city
the incident threatens to ratchet up tensions between britain and russia
on tuesday , the british foreign secretary , boris johnson , said the skripal case had echoes of what happened to alexander litvinenko , a former kgb operative who british officials believe was poisoned in london by russian agents
responding to a question about the case , the russian embassy in london said it had received no information about the substance of the case and criticized johnsons response as strongly anti-russian.
the police also appealed to members of the public who had visited salisbury town center on sunday afternoon , including the zizzi restaurant and bishops mill pub , which the two russians reportedly visited
