london for the first time since the 2016 brexit vote , queen elizabeth ii has spoken out about the contentious issue of britains upcoming exit from the european union
but she did it in an uncontentious way
this queen doesnt do politics
thats the key to her staying power she rules by not ruling
and so it was that on tuesday evening , she referred to brexit in an oblique way
she told the king and queen of the netherlands that britain is looking toward a new partnership with europe and that shared values between britain and europe are our greatest asset.
was she expressing a tinge of remainer regret
or is she a confident brexiteer
as ever with britains inscrutable monarch , it was impossible to know
that didnt stop people from assuming that she is on their side
the queen 's a leaver , said one twitter user
elizabeth was speaking at a buckingham palace state banquet for dutch king willem-alexander and queen maxima
she said ( starting at 3.30 in the clip below )
'over the many hundreds of years of our shared history , there are few nations who are able to claim a closer bond
'watch the queen 's speech at last night 's state banquet held in honour of the visiting king and queen of the netherlands at buckingham palace
the queen is famously impartial on political matters
unlike her more outspoken son prince charles , she is careful to keep her own counsel
buckingham palace took action when , just a few months before the brexit vote , the sun tabloid published an exclusive bombshell on its front page that claimed the queen backs brexit.
the newspaper said that elizabeth had shared her anti-european union views with nick clegg , the then-deputy prime minister
clegg said the report was nonsense.
the palace lodged a complaint to the media watchdog and insisted that the queen is politically neutral
the watchdog ruled that the headline was misleading , but the paper stood by its piece
although the queen rules above the political fray , she has shown a card or two over her long reign
during the scottish referendum campaign , she told a well-wisher outside a church that britons should think very carefully about the future , which some interpreted as support for scotland remaining in the united kingdom
for his part , the king of the netherlands said he is saddened by brexit but respects the decision
willem-alexander said during a banquet tuesday evening
willem-alexander also praised the queens adventurous streak , referring to her appearance alongside actor daniel craig in the opening ceremonies of the 2012 london olympics
the queen played , he said , the most fearless bond girl ever.
