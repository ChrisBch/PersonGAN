london the very future of democracy is being threatened by fake news , a british parliamentary committee is warning , and the government response should include making tech companies legally liable and subject to algorithm audits
thats the conclusion after a lengthy probe by britains digital , culture , media and sport committee
the plucky little panel , led by conservative lawmaker damian collins , has covered issues including facebook data mining , russian election meddling and questionable brexit financing
witnesses who have testified before it christopher wylie , arron banks and alexander nix , to name a few have generated some of the biggest political stories of the year
its interim report was made available to news organizations , stakeholders , politicians and individuals for review before its official publication sunday
after several british news organizations broke the embargo , the washington post decided to publish also
the report concludes that an even bigger concern than obviously false information is the manipulation and misuse of personal data and the deliberate stoking of fears and prejudices by state-sponsored actors , private companies and other groups agendas to influence voting
in an interview with the post last month , collins said that after interviewing u.s. tech companies and researchers in washington in february , the commitee realized that fake news based on lies was only a small part of the problem
the report also proposes that the government should have the power to audit tech companies nonfinancial aspects , including their algorithms
he noted that facebook has already made advertising on its network more transparent and has been investing in people and technology to detect and remove bad content , but that it would go further still
facebook founder mark zuckerberg has declined to testify before the committee , sending his chief technology officer and two policy staffers in his stead
lawmakers have threatened to formally subpoena him when he next steps foot in britain
the committee heard evidence from 61 witnesses and received more than 150 written submissions
it held 20 oral evidence sessions , including one in washington the first time a select committee has held a live broadcast session in another country
a second report is expected to be published in the fall
of various digital advertising companies , such as cambridge analytica , scl and aggregateiq
