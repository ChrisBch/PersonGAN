president trump will travel to britain in july for a working visit , the office of british prime minister theresa may announced thursday , making good on a plan delayed in part by the threat of protests in london
the trip will include talks with british leaders but will be a lower-key affair and not a full state visit , downing street confirmed
the prime ministers office said in a statement
british foreign secretary boris johnson said it was fantastic news that trump would at last come to britain.
may was the first foreign leader to meet with trump in washington after his inauguration in january 2017
at the time , she said trump had accepted an invitation from queen elizabeth ii for a state visit later in the year
but british lawmakers and others objected to a full state visit , which traditionally includes a carriage ride with the queen and a banquet at buckingham palace
trump is a deeply controversial figure in britain , largely because of his anti-immigrant and anti-muslim positions
in november , he prompted widespread criticism when he retweeted a far-right british groups anti-muslim videos
after may said he was wrong to have shared the videos , trump told her to focus on terrorism in her country
trump told may in a phone call in december that he planned to visit in early 2018 , and the u.s. ambassador in london , woody johnson , said he hoped trump would cut the ribbon for the new u.s. embassy in south london
numerous activist groups vowed to disrupt such a visit
trump later dropped the plan , saying the new $ 1 billion embassy was a bad real estate deal for an off location.
he blamed former president barack obama , although the deal was struck under president george w. bush
the location was determined primarily by security concerns
trump and may had said at their last meeting , at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , in january , that the visit would occur soon
trump said in davos that the perception of a poor relationship between the two leaders is incorrect
the two speak far less frequently than do trump and french president emmanuel macron , however , and it was france and not staunch ally britain that was rewarded with the first state visit of the trump presidency
