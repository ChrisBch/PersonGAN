liverpool , england members of the opposition labour party on tuesday voted overwhelmingly to support a second referendum a peoples vote on brexit
but what kind of vote , exactly , and when
the most cathartic moment of the annual party conference came tuesday morning , when labours brexit secretary , keir starmer , improvised on his prepared remarks and stated , nobody is ruling out remain as an option.
the audience of several thousand burst into applause and stood for long minutes
members told the washington post they were hopeful that somehow there was a chance that britains exit from the european union could be reversed
the enthusiasm in the hall was in line with recent polls showing that the vast majority of labour party members , especially its young activists , want to remain in the e.u
yet there is little support from most of the party leadership for a complete do-over , as opposed to a thumbs-up or -down vote on prime minister theresa mays final proposal for the relationship between britain and the e.u
and because no one can predict what will happen with the pending divorce , the measure passed by dues-paying labour delegates was necessarily couched in hypotheticals
should the british parliament vote down whatever deal may manages to strike with the e.u
corbyn stressed that there should be a vote to approve or oppose any deal may might strike with brussels
but he and other party leaders stopped short of endorsing another possible referendum on the essential question of whether to leave or remain
emily thornberry , who serves as labours shadow foreign secretary , warned that a replay would be deeply anti-democratic.
brendan chilton , a leader of the group called labour leave , called it a betrayal of the very highest order against the millions of labour supporters who voted in june 2016 for britain to leave the e.u
gareth snell , a labour member of parliament whose constituency voted 70 percent to leave the e.u. , said the promise of a do-over referendum had more fudge that a cornish sweetshop.
he said the sequence of events that would result in a new referendum seemed unlikely and that the focus instead should be on the underlying forces behind brexit
among activists at the conference , though , there was a different cry
will harrison , 58 , works in technology and was handing out yellow stickers that read bollocks to brexit.
he said labour was moving in the right direction , but that the option to remain in the e.u
needed to be an option in any future vote
brenda bixter , a 50-something musician and teacher , said she felt bereaved after the brexit vote and hoped the conference would be pivotal.
anything can be stopped , she said
