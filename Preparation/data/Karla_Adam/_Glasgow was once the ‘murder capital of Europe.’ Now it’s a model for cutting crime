glasgow , scotland jonathan has scars from his former life
jagged scars on his neck and the back of his head
he has a history of drug abuse and assault
some of the punches he threw landed on police officers
but today his scars are partly covered by a bright pink shirt and black apron
he leans across a gleaming counter to hand over a chicken wrap and fries.
sea salt or chili salt
he asks a customer , with an affable grin
jonathan , 28 , works at street and arrow , a cafe in a 31-foot airstream trailer that offers second chances along with trendy street food
the truck is run , at an arms length , by the scottish police
its part of an approach to tackling violence that authorities say has had a notable impact on crime in a city with a rough reputation , and its attracting attention in london and beyond
in 2005 , the world health organization dubbed glasgow the murder capital of europe.
there had been 83 homicides the previous year in the glasgow region , where gangs were known for their booze-and-blades culture
exasperated police in glasgow decided to rethink strategy
they set up a violence reduction unit ( vru ) guided by the philosophy that violence is like a public health issue violent behavior spreads from person to person
to contain it , you need to think in terms of transmission and risk , symptoms and causes
you can not arrest your way out of this problem , said niven rennie , director of the now-national scottish vru , a unit funded by the government with a budget of $ 1.6 million this year
scottish police plucked ideas from the cure violence project in chicago , bostons operation ceasefire and homeboy industries in los angeles , among other initiatives
they formed partnerships with local teachers , doctors and social workers
they didnt abandon traditional policing
shortly after launching the vru , police ratcheted up stop-and-search and successfully campaigned for legislation that increased the maximum sentences for carrying a knife
but increasingly , they emphasized the interruption and prevention of violent behavior
they are intervening in hospitals , working with partners in schools and helping former offenders get back to work
meanwhile , over the past decade , glasgow has seen a 60 percent drop in homicides , and violent crime in scotland has fallen to historic lows
the notion that the public health approach may have contributed to the decline has brought officers from as far afield as canada and new zealand to glasgow to learn more
the mayor said in a statement
researchers urge caution in assessing the impact of scotlands program
they stress the difficulty of pinpointing and disentangling the variables that influence crime rates
there are a lot of factors at play , said susan mcvie , a professor of criminology at the university of edinburgh
the picture is complicated by statistics showing that crime also has decreased in areas of scotland where the vru is not active
other possible explanations for the decline include anti-knife campaigns in scottish schools and a trend of young people spending more time at home and less lingering on the streets
some international comparisons have also shown scotland to score relatively high on assault rates , although scottish officials dismiss the comparisons because of different ways of counting and recording crime
and yet there is consensus that glasgows gang culture is not what it once was
and individuals involved with scotlands anti-violence efforts say they can see the difference it is making
eddie gorman , 53 , spent more than 20 years in prison before joining the vru
he now works as one of the programs navigators , patrolling emergency wards at the glasgow royal infirmary on fridays , saturdays and sundays peak days for violence in hopes of finding people at a reachable moment.
soft-spoken but armed with stories from his own chaotic past , gorman points people in the direction of help , whether thats counseling , an alcohol recovery program or housing
callum , 27 , remembers when he first met a pink-shirted navigator
early last year , he was rushed to the hospital after being stabbed nine times
it was his 17th visit to emergency room in just over a year
his back is a canvass of scars
( like others interviewed for this article , he spoke to the washington post on the condition that only his first name would be used , so that future employers wont immediately associate him with his past )
callum said that when he drank he became violent , but he didnt know how to stop the cycle
after getting help with his drinking , he was offered a 12-month job at the street and arrow food truck and 18 months of mentorship
today , hes employed as a mentor at the second street and arrow cafe
christine goodall , an oral surgeon in glasgow , works in partnership with the scottish police
a decade ago , she said , hospital staff were inundated with patients pouring in with broken jaws , broken cheekbones , slashes across the face.
he said that about 150 people have been through the programs various employment schemes and estimates that about 85 percent have gone on to find other jobs
back at the food truck , jonathan is busy preparing meals for the lunchtime crowd , which included a former offender who used to work at the food truck and now is employed as a supervisor at a nearby shop
despite his history of assaulting police officers , jonathan now counts murray as a friend
he said hes working on his issues with authority and values the feelings check-in sessions with his mentor at work a big deal for a glaswegian like him who grew up thinking that showing vulnerability was a form of weakness
its like no other work environment , jonathan said , shaking chili salt onto a plate of fries
