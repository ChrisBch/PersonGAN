london less than a month after she sensationally resigned her post as the bbc 's china editor , journalist carrie gracie appeared before british lawmakers wednesday and explained the circumstances that led to her departure in protest over unequal pay
in more than two hours of testimony that was by turns emotional and excoriating , gracie said she was shocked to discover that her male peers earned at least 50 percent more than she did
my case is just an example of a bigger problem , she told a parliamentary select committee investigating pay equality at the bbc
if the bbc ca n't sort it out for me for me , a senior person of 55 , in a powerful position how can it sort it out for more vulnerable people who do n't have a public profile
a top bbc editor found out male peers were earning 50 percent more
so she resigned
tony hall , the bbc 's director general , described gracie as a first rate editor and said he admired the stance she was taking on pay
however , he said that the corporation did not discriminate based on gender and that there were differences in scope and the scale between jobs such as china editor and north america editor
the bbc , the largest and arguably best-known public broadcaster in the world , has been rocked by a months-long controversy over its pay culture
the bbc is woven into the fabric of british life some call it simply auntie or the beeb
it 's also publicly funded , financed largely through an annual $ 208 license fee paid by television users , and it is subject to bouts of political scrutiny and self-flagellation
on tuesday , the bbc published an audit of salaries paid to employees who appear on the air , carried out by pricewaterhouse-coopers
the auditors found a 6.8 percent pay gap between men and women but reported that there was no gender bias regarding pay decisions
the report added that there were anomalies that need addressing at the bbc , including a lack of transparency over how it pays its staff
a group of bbc women who have been campaigning for equal pay dismissed the report as a whitewash
this report has reached the conclusion the bbc wanted it to reach , said jane garvey , one of the broadcaster 's leading presenters
a furor over pay inequality at the bbc has been raging since last summer , when the corporation reluctantly revealed the salaries of stars who earned more than 150,000 pounds ( $ 212,000 )
two-thirds of the people on that list were men
since then , 230 people have filed pay grievances against the corporation
there is a large-scale push in britain to tackle pay inequality
last year , the government introduced new requirements that made reporting on gender pay gaps mandatory for all private- and public-sector companies with more than 250 employees
companies must file by april 2018
in october , the bbc published its gender-pay-gap data for all of its staff those who work on and off the air and found that men earned 9.3 percent more than women
in response to tuesday 's report , the bbc said there would be substantial pay reductions for some men and pay increases for some men and women
the corporation said it has identified nearly 200 people men and women who will probably receive raises
this will disproportionately improve pay for women , as it is more common to find women in roles at the lower end of the current pay ranges , it said
she also noted that some employers in britain want to avoid admitting fault , in part because they are concerned they will be hit by claims for backdated pay to compensate for years of underpayment
last week , the corporation announced that six male presenters john humphrys , jeremy vine , huw edwards , nicky campbell , jon sopel and nick robinson agreed to take pay cuts
their new salaries were not disclosed
top male bbc stars will take pay cut after gender pay disparity scandal
ahead of wednesday 's hearing , a group representing 170 women at the bbc said in written testimony submitted to parliament that some women had received veiled threats when they raised the subject of equal pay
gracie , a senior bbc journalist who speaks mandarin fluently and has a degree in chinese , left her post as china editor after she discovered that her male colleagues were being paid substantially more than she was
gracie said the bbc told her she was paid less than her peers because she was in development during the first years of her posting in china
she described that as an insult to add to the original injury , noting that she led china coverage for four years and that it carried significant risks
but when she was in discussions about the china job in 2013 , she demanded pay parity
she was offered 130,000 pounds
she later discovered that the bbc 's north america editor , jon sopel , was making between 200,000 and 249,999 pounds and the middle east editor jeremy bowen between 150,000 and 199,999 pounds
now the corporation has offered her about 100,000 pounds ( $ 141,670 ) in back pay , gracie said
they are trying to throw money at me to resolve the problem , she said
this will not resolve my problem
my problem will be resolved by an acknowledgment that my work was of equal value to the men whom i served alongside
