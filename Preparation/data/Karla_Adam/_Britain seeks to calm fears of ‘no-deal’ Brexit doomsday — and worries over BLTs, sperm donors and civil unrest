london no need to panic
or maybe there is just a little
britain on thursday offered a snapshot of a nation trying to come to grips with a possible no-deal exit from the european union meaning it would be cut loose without any prearranged pacts on trade , travel and security with its longtime partners
british officials have long promised this was unlikely , because it would introduce a mountain of costly red tape , tariffs and friction at the borders
but the government has now released its first technical notices on how british citizens and businesses might be wise to prepare for the countrys possible crash out of the e.u
next year without a divorce settlement in place
for weeks , there has been a string of doomsday scenarios in the british news media about what could happen if prime minister theresa mays negotiators fail to strike an agreement with brussels
there has been speculation floated by think tanks , business lobbies and hospital administrators a no-deal brexit could create total havoc
imagine , they say , days-long traffic jams at the ferry ports and euro-tunnel empty shelves at the grocery markets shortages of fuel and medicines chaos at the airport immigration booths and police locked out of cross-border databases about terror suspects
british farmers worry who will pick the fruit after brexit
there have also been stories about a sandwich famine and the british army seriously being deployed to suppress civil unrest
last month , the british sandwich association warned a no-deal brexit could affect the range of luncheon items on offer if it became harder to import out-of-season ingredients with a short shelf-life , like lettuce and tomatoes
said brexit secretary dominic raab after the release of 148 pages in 25 advisories , the first tranche of 80 documents on a possible no-deal world
but thursdays advisories even after being reportedly softened by the government still conjure up a lot of hassle , added cost and dysfunction
in the past , may and her pro-brexit cabinet repeatedly assured britain a sweet deal with brussels was just around the corner
now government ministers say it is about 50-50 chance of a favorable brexit deal
the british public is even less optimistic , according to the most recent polling
in its first papers on a no-deal brexit , mays government warned the cost of credit card payments between the britain and europe will probably increase and so will the cost of internet purchases totaling in the billions from europe
brits working and living in europe could also lose access to british banking and pension services
some 250,000 british retirees live in europe
british hospital officials have warned a no-deal brexit could hurt patients
raab said the pharmaceutical companies already warehouse 200 medicines in case of shortages and more is on the way
raab said the government was planning to hire 9,000 more civil servants to handle brexit , in addition to 7,000 bureaucrats already tending to the divorce
currently , there is frictionless trade and zero tariffs for trade between britain and its european union partners
barely 200 days remain before britain exits the e.u
in march 2019 , and much about the future relationship with the continent remains unknown
the opposition labour partys brexit spokesman , keir starmer , said mays government was now moving into panic mode.
starmer told bbc radio
