in the conference hall in birmingham , many tories said they were now more hopeful that may might be able to rally the party behind her and avoid a disastrous exit from the european bloc
i feel inspired , said jayne rear , a conservative party member on the local governing council in lancashire.
theresa may is back in top form.
on social media , some posts praised the 62-year-old prime minister for her self-deprecating humor ( shed been poked fun of after busting a few moves on a recent trip to africa ) , while others lamented that abba was now ruined for them
going into the annual conservative party conference , there were questions about whether may might face a leadership challenge
rumors swirl daily of plots to replace her
but it does not appear there is yet a challenger with the nerve and backing to topple may in a no-confidence vote
many now think mays wednesday speech will help keep her in office at least for the next six months
on tuesday , johnson who remains a conservative member of parliament and is widely thought to aspire to become prime minister someday wailed about mays compromise brexit proposal , which seeks to preserve trade with europe by aligning britain with e.u
rules and regulations
johnson called her approach sad , wrong , weak , dangerous and a cheat against the millions of brits who voted to divorce the continent
he urged may to chuck chequers , her plan named after the prime ministers countryside manor , and instead try for a free-trade deal along the lines of the pact recently negotiated between canada and the e.u
after johnsons speech which was applauded by fellow tories may confessed to the bbc that she was cross with her colleague
she clearly had him in mind , although she never mentioned him by name , when she had her turn at the rostrum
she told the conference
may warned , we are entering the toughest phase of the negotiations.
she said , what we are proposing is very challenging for the e.u.
may also prepared her party and the country for the possibility that britain will leave the bloc in march 2019 with no deal a doomsday scenario for many businesses that rely on trade with the continent
may promised that britain would leave the union next year , and she heaped disdain on her labour party opponents who have been pushing for a second referendum on brexit
closing the conservative conference , may sought to reassure britain of its progress
may said , promising help to bolster housing stocks , improve care at overwhelmed hospitals and make the trains run on time
but there was one huge omission , the professor said
he said that may might be tacking toward a model of brexit more favored by critics such johnson in part to usurp the threat coming from him.
