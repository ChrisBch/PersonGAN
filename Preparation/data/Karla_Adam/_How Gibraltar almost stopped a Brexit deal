london nothing is simple in brexitland
in the lead-up to a historic summit sunday in brussels , where a brexit deal is expected to be rubber-stamped , tiny gibraltar suddenly loomed large
it literally put britains european union divorce settlement between the rock and a hard place for a time
thats because spanish prime minister pedro snchez insisted his country have final say over any future status of the enclave , a self-governing british territory on the tip of southern spain and near the narrow mouth of the mediterranean
spain , which has had a centuries-long feud with britain over gibraltar , wanted britain to make a commitment in writing before the summit
it went down to the wire
late week , snchez said spain would lift its veto because the european union and britain had accepted spains demands
the summit , he said , could go ahead now that he had received written assurances that meant that in the future madrid and london could directly negotiate on brexit issues relating to gibraltar
on sunday , the leaders of the 28 e.u
countries are expected to meet in brussels at a carefully choreographed summit to approve brexit plans and an accompanying political declaration on the future ties between britain and the 27 e.u
nations that will say goodbye officially in march
the brexit package , which is very much british prime minister theresa mays deal , has been painstakingly crafted
hemos alcanzado un acuerdo histrico y maana votaremos a favor del brexit
europa y reino unido han aceptado nuestras exigencias
espaa logra un triple blindaje con el que puede abordar definitivamente con el reino unido el futuro de gibraltar en los prximos aos
around 30,000 britons live in gibraltar , a 2.6-square-mile rocky outpost that shares a land border with spain
it was famously the headquarters for gen. dwight d. eisenhower during the planning stages of the allied invasion of north africa in 1942
the sovereignty issues around gibraltar may have hit the headlines this week , but they are long-festering
gibraltar was ceded to britain in 1713 under the treaty of utrecht , but it is still claimed by spain
in a 2002 referendum , its citizens overwhelming rejected a proposal of joint british-spanish rule , instead opting to remain under the sovereignty of britain only
but the two countries have deep ties with each other an estimated 12,000 workers cross the border every day
in the 2016 e.u
referendum , gibraltarians voted 96 percent to remain in the european union
may has said any brexit deal must apply to the whole u.k. family , including gibraltar
after my conversation with theresa may , our positions remain far away
my government will always defend the interests of spain
if there are no changes , we will veto brexit
spain cant officially veto the withdrawal agreement , a 585-page legally binding agreement , but the e.u
has worked hard at presenting a united front during brexit negotiations and it wanted a consensus sunday
donald tusk , the president of the european council , tweeted on saturday afternoon that there was unity and solidarity from the e.u
he added no one has reasons to be happy.
i will recommend that we approve on sunday the outcome of the brexit negotiations
no one has reasons to be happy
but at least at this critical time , the eu27 has passed the test of unity and solidarity
even with the gibraltar issue solved at the 11th hour , mays headaches are far from over
if the deal is finalized in brussels this weekend , as expected , may still needs to convince the majority of british lawmakers to back her deal arguably her biggest challenge yet
