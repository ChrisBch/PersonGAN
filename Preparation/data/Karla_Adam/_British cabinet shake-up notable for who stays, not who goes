london british prime minister theresa may began reshuffling her leadership team monday in a bid to reboot her conservative party after a bungled election last year
there were a few top-level changes
immigration minister brandon lewis , for instance , was appointed conservative party chairman , a role that includes the day-to-day running of the party
education secretary justine greening quit the government , after refusing to take a new post , and was replaced by damian hinds
but all the big beasts as the british media and commentators call political heavyweights kept their jobs
foreign secretary boris johnson , chancellor of the exchequer philip hammond , home secretary amber rudd and brexit minister david davis all stayed put
one constraint is keeping the delicate balance in may 's top team between those who supported the leave agenda and those who backed remain in britain 's referendum on whether to stay in the european union

another , ford said , is the risk of potentially mobilizing any of the big beasts
he added it 's the old lyndon johnson adage
i 'll avoid the ruder version
you want them inside the tent weeing out , not outside the tent weeing in
may called last year 's general election in hopes of strengthening her hand ahead of all-important brexit negotiations
instead , her conservative party now has to rely on northern ireland 's democratic unionist party to pass key legislation
the reshuffle was prompted in part by the ousting of damian green , may 's deputy and the de facto deputy prime minister
green was forced to step down after he made misleading statements about pornographic images found on his computer
david lidington , the justice secretary , replaced green on monday but was not given green 's title of first secretary of state
in a surprise development , james brokenshire , a longtime ally of may 's , resigned from his post as northern ireland secretary , citing upcoming lung surgery
karen bradley , the culture secretary , replaced him
theresa mays horrible , no good , very bad day
the reorganization will extend through tuesday , when there could be a clutch of new mid-ranking ministers , commentators said
according to analysts , the party could promote a younger generation of politicians to try to lure some of the youth vote that has gone to the opposition labour party
the top-level changes announced monday did not happen without an embarrassing gaffe
the reshuffle began when the conservative party 's social media team tweeted congratulations to transport secretary chris grayling on his appointment as the new conservative party chairman
the tweet was quickly deleted , and it was announced shortly afterward that the job would in fact go to lewis , the immigration minister
that reign of conservative party chairman lasted about 37 seconds , noted sky news 's faisal islam
