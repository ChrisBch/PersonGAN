london go ahead and laugh , a lot of brits have , but shes giving it a go
and for those who mock british prime minster theresa may imagine labour leader jeremy corbyn or her nemesis boris johnson busting a move
the british leader has brought out her dance moves ( again ) in africa , this time in kenya during her visit with a local troop of boy scouts
undeterred from the social media mockery that greeted a similar routine earlier this week , the british leader seemed to double down and go for it
as students of british politics know , may is not someone who gives up when things get rough
may has shown , time and time again , shes not one for quitting
and so it was that on thursday , during a visit to the united nations offices in nairobi , that the normally private politician showed off her uniquely fancy footwork
got to sort of almost kind of respect theresa may for doubling down on the dancing
these moves even more epic than the last
it was joyful , if not entirely comfortable , viewing
her moves have earned her nicknames ranging from the maybot to twinkle toes theresa
the british leader was in south africa , nigeria and kenya this week as part of a three-day trip to africa where she hoped to strengthen trade ties ahead of britains upcoming departure from the european union
britain is seeking to increase its investment in africa , particularly in light of strong competition from the united states , china and france , and may announced plans for putting $ 5.1 billion into the continent
during her visit , she talked about trade , aid initiatives and plastic recycling , but its arguably her dance floor diplomacy that garnered the most attention
the daily telegraph called it a hilariously clumsy attempt at dancing
the guardian said she was an awkward if energetic dancer and called one of her moves a cross between a standing-up front crawl and a desperate attempt to hail a cab
guests on morning television on friday were given instructions on how to mimic mays maneuvers
imagine that youre on a farm and you 're picking fruit , guests on itvs good morning britain were told
imagine youre on a farm and youre picking fruit

her latest moves once again lit up social media
susan rice , the former national security adviser to president obama , tweeted omg
ive seen a lot of leaders go to africa and get moved by the spirit , but this takes the cake
somebody help her , please

some said that the critics should ease up
may was clearly enjoying herself and had the nerve to give it a go
i want to keep dancing as i get older because its such a joyful , inclusive , stupid thing and it shouldnt matter how you look
no shame in having a bop

others wondered if they would have done any better
i make her look like jennifer lopez , wrote one user
the reason i 've not passed judgement on theresa may 's dancing is because i make her look like jennifer lopez
during her trip may was , inevitably , asked if shed consider competing on strictly come dancing , the british version of dancing with the stars
she laughed it off
i think the chances of 'strictly come dancing coming calling are pretty minimal , she told sky news
