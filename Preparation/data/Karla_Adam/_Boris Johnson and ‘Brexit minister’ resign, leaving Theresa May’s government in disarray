ever since may bungled the 2017 election , losing a majority in parliament , there has been speculation over how long she would hold the top job
that question has never been more urgent
as may prepares to meet this week with president trump in his first official visit to britain , hard-line brexiteers are openly debating a no-confidence vote that could sweep her from power
he is divisive , and his stock has fallen lately
but the whitehall mandarins and british political class have long assumed he covets the keys to 10 downing street
his departure hints at a possible leadership challenge within mays conservative party
i am sorry and a little surprised , may wrote in reply
johnsons allies say he did the honorable thing by resigning
his critics see selfish maneuvering
may replaced johnson on monday with jeremy hunt , formerly the health secretary , who successfully secured a big bump in spending for the underfunded national health service
hunt campaigned to remain in the e.u
but later said he had changed his mind
may named as daviss successor 44-year-old dominic raab , a leading pro-brexit campaigner who served as her housing minister
but the bombshell resignations expose may to further confrontations with restive conservative party members outraged over what they see as the prime ministers plan for a soft brexit that keeps britain tied to many e.u
rules and regulations after it leaves the bloc in march 2019
backers of a hard brexit , who want a decisive break from brussels , are now in revolt
they denounced mays latest road map as a fudge , a timid capitulation , a brexit in name only that ignores the 52 percent of voters who opted in june 2016 to leave the e.u
he said the conservative party doesnt really have the appetite for another general election because of the ongoing brexit negotiations and because tories havent coalesced around a candidate to champion
while some see an english original , others see a clown
when she praised johnson for his passion , jeering erupted in the chamber
when she said brexit had generated a spirited national debate , there were guffaws
a responsible government must prepare for a range of potential outcomes.
where mays brexit plans go now is an open question
business leaders in britain who run companies that make airplanes and automobiles are clamoring for answers and warning that brexit is drifting toward the rocks
the pound sterling slid after the johnson resignation , while the markets ticked up
across the english channel , reaction was muted
european council president donald tusk said monday of daviss exit , just before being informed of johnsons resignation
he said the same sentiment extended to johnson as well
last month , johnson told an audience at a private gala dinner that he thought trump would do a much better job at negotiating brexit than his prime minister
how the bad boys of brexit forged ties with russia and trump campaign
if may refuses to toughen her brexit plan , angry tories could seek a no-confidence vote
at least 48 conservative members of parliament would need to write letters to trigger it
then may would need to win over the majority of conservative lawmakers to stay in power
many commentators think she has the numbers to win such a vote
if she failed , a leadership contest would ensue and in might step johnson , among others
in his letter of resignation late sunday , davis suggested that mays promise that britain and its parliament would take back control from brussels was hollow
he warned may that her approach would lead to further demands from brussels and give europe control of large swaths of the british economy
for two years , chief negotiator davis had been the white-haired , ruddy-cheeked face of brexit
but talks in brussels were notoriously slow , because mays government could not and still can not agree on what kind of future relationship britain wants with europe on trade , immigration , law , tariffs and border checks and security
recently it was revealed that davis had attended only four hours of talks in brussels this year , going as long as three months without meeting the e.u.s chief negotiator , michel barnier
protesters call for second brexit vote
the prime minister had appeared to win over her fractious cabinet at a retreat on friday , and a lengthy white paper staking out britains vision for future relations with europe was due to be published as soon as this week
while mays plan for exiting the e.u
that , her critics say , would shackle britain and make it a rule taker versus a rulemaker.
in parliament , hard-line brexit supporters are the most vocal but are not the majority
a compromise exit is supported by moderates across parliament , including those in the conservative and labour parties , among others
jeremy corbyn , the labour party leader , mocked may on monday , saying it had taken her two long years to come up with a brexit plan and only two days for that plan to unravel
