but in the two years since the referendum , something remarkable happened the british stopped worrying so much about foreigners
pollsters have uncovered a mellowing of attitudes about immigration , expressed by both those who voted to leave the european bloc and those who voted to remain
said rob ford , a politics professor at the university of manchester
the shift highlights how mercurial the topic of immigration can be a hot-button issue one year , a yawn the next
and it may suggest something about what the public will support , as prime minister theresa may tries to sell the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with e.u
officials and her plans for what comes next
in exchange for obeying trade rules from brussels , may is promising the british people that she will slash the countrys post-brexit immigration levels
the 3 million europeans already living in britain will be allowed to stay , but the government will set new guidelines for how many foreigners will be allowed into the country , with what levels of income and from which countries
during a marathon session in parliament on thursday , may emphasized that her brexit plan would bring an end to days when anyone in the e.u
could simply move to london , rent a flat , take a job and get on the national health-care plan
but the question looms is may looking in the rearview mirror , while the public has largely moved on
last month , the figure was 27 percent
a second major polling firm , ipsos-mori , reported a similar drop in respondents citing immigration as the most important issue facing britain today from 48 percent in june 2016 to 17 percent in october
thats an extraordinary plunge , say polling experts and its mirrored by parallel surveys and focus group studies done for academics , advocacy groups and the e.u
its really quite striking , said lindsay richards , a sociologist at the university of oxford who has written on the topic for the migration observatory , an independent research group
manchester universitys ford said that when people listed immigration as a top concern before the brexit vote , it tended to reflect anti-immigrant sentiment , not worries about how asylum seekers pouring into europe were being treated
its no mystery what side they are on.
britain today still has high rates of immigration
but migration to europe from north africa has dropped to pre-surge levels
net migration from the e.u
to britain peaked around 189,000 the year before the brexit vote
the latest figures show that its around 87,000 , meaning that it has more than halved in two years
polls still find broad support for reducing the overall number of newcomers
surveys also find respondents divided over whether immigration and multiculturalism is good or bad for british culture.
but since the brexit vote , fewer people tell pollsters that there are too many immigrants in the united kingdom
britons also have become more positive about the ideas that immigration is good for the economy and that the united kingdom should allow more e.u
said anthony wells , yougovs director of political and social opinion polling
richards said it is especially significant that the views of both remainers and leavers have relaxed on immigration even as the sides remain bitterly divided over brexit
while there is widespread agreement that professed attitudes toward immigration have shifted , no one has put their finger on precisely why
opinion analysts say current worries over brexit ( now the top concern , along with the national health service , in opinion polls ) may have replaced or absorbed past anxiety over immigration
others point to a changing news and social media landscape , with far fewer front pages depicting immigrants as job-stealing scammers
during their campaign , brexiteers urged voters to take back control , a powerful phrase that , in a single stroke , encapsulated the ideas of regaining lost authority over immigration and sovereignty , one of the other drivers of the brexit vote
there were also more-overt appeals to fuel anti-immigrant emotions , with micro-targeted ads on facebook and mass-media campaigns
vote leave , the official group campaigning for brexit , falsely claimed that turkey was about to join the e.u. , and that gun-toting turkish mobsters would be ones new neighbors
nigel farage , who led the pro-brexit u.k
independence party , unveiled a poster featuring syrian and other asylum seekers marching through east european fields next to the slogan breaking point.
according to one researcher , over a six-year period starting in 2010 , the daily express carried front-page migration stories on 179 occasions , and the daily mail , 122 times
george osborne , the former chancellor of the exchequer who campaigned for britain to remain in the e.u. , recently told the bbc that his conservative partys remain campaign didnt do enough to promote the benefits of european immigration
the biggest immigration story since the brexit vote didnt have anything to do with e.u
workers or migrants from the middle east and north africa
it was about the windrush generation , people brought legally from commonwealth countries in the caribbean to help rebuild britain after world war ii , only to find their legal status questioned by british authorities decades later
when brexit news features e.u
migrants , the stories typically highlight how britain could lose european nationals who contribute to the economy by working as berry pickers , baristas , and nurses at the national health service
but when the group hired professional pollsters to survey a representative sample , they found that most britons are balancers , who see the dueling pressures and gains of immigration
wells , of yougov , wonders how much the shift in opinion on immigration has to do with how the tribes of brexit leavers and remainers want to think of themselves
the roughly half of voters who identify as remainers are able to defend their position on brexit by associating even more strongly with a pro-immigrant stance , wells said
the leavers , on the other hand , are hostile to the suggestion they voted to exit the european bloc because of migrants , which has been cast as a bigoted or even racist position
but a second plebiscite is opposed by the prime minister , who says it would be anti-democratic
a do-over is only halfheartedly embraced by the opposition labour party , whose leaders worry about losing the working-class supporters who want brexit
while people are less negative about immigration than they were two years ago , the majority still want to see numbers come down , said kully kaur-ballagan , research director at ipsos-mori polling
if that doesnt happen , she said , it could reemerge as an issue.
