london the british revolt against president trump swelled thursday with parliament members openly deriding him and britain 's prime minister standing by her denunciations of trump 's retweets of a fringe group 's anti-muslim videos
prime minister theresa may blasted trump for crossing a line by posting the inflammatory videos on his twitter page wednesday and then warning may to essentially mind her own business and focus on islamist terrorism instead of him
but officials were careful to note that ties with the united states are stronger than the current flare-up with the white house
it 's increasingly clear that any official visit from president trump to britain would not be welcomed , tweeted london 's mayor , sadiq khan , the first muslim to hold the office
khan has repeatedly called for britain to withdraw an invitation for trump to visit and his stance appeared to gain backing amid the outrage against the president
how trump elevated a hateful fringe group
british officials were shocked at the personal nature of the tweet against may and the suggestion that trump was boasting even gloating that the united states has been relatively free of terrorist attacks while britain has suffered a string of deadly assaults
theresa_may , do n't focus on me , focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom , trump tweeted late wednesday
we are doing just fine
trump was responding to statements from 10 downing street that the president was wrong to retweet three anti-muslim videos from the far-right group britain first , which describes itself as a defender against growing islamic influence in britain
trump later deleted and reposted the tweet aimed at may because he had gotten the social media address of the prime minister wrong suggesting to many british officials that the president was operating alone , without consultation or support from white house advisers
may on thursday reiterated her stance that trump was wrong to share the anti-muslim tweets
but at a news conference in jordan , she repeatedly deflected questions about trump 's tweet that criticized her
instead , she spoke about what 's called the special relationship between britain and the united states , saying it was an enduring relationship because it is in both our national interests for that relation to be there
trump blasted theresa may
he got the wrong woman
asked whether she would fire someone from her senior leadership team if they retweeted the same account trump did , she said i have absolute confidence that my cabinet ministers would not be retweeting material from britain first
trump has a history of jumping on twitter and causing headaches for british officials
but this was the first time that he publicly took aim at the british prime minister
sajid javid , britain 's communities secretary , tweeted that trump endorsed the views of a vile , hate-filled racist organisation that hates me and people like me
he is wrong and i refuse to let it go and say nothing
trump once tweeted that nigel farage , the former leader of the anti-immigrant u.k
independence party , would be a great choice as british ambassador to the united states
he also attacked khan , london 's mayor , following a terrorist attack at london bridge
trump 's latest missives prompted an urgent debate in parliament on thursday , where politicians across the political divide lined up to condemn the president 's tweets
in remarks rarely uttered about a u.s. president in the house of commons , some parliamentarians mocked trump as stupid
stephen doughty , a labour party lawmaker , told parliament by sharing it , he is either a racist , incompetent or unthinking or all three
he also added that i love america , that his great-grandfather was an american soldier and that he has traveled extensively in the united states
it is a country and people of extraordinary generosity , courage , kindness and humanity but this president represents none of those things
we have been clear president donald trump was wrong to retweet videos posted by far-right group britain first , rudd said
but she also urged lawmakers to consider the bigger value of the deep ties with the united states
justine greening , britain 's education secretary , tried to walk a similar tightrope
this is a president that behaves unlike any other in the nature of the tweets he puts out
i do n't believe that should be able to undermine an overall important relationship with our country , she told the bbc
vince cable , the leader of the liberal democrats , was one of many to call on may to cancel the state visit offered to trump
she must end humiliating dependence of brexit britain on goodwill of evil racist
cancel visit , cable tweeted
british leaders are playing a nuanced game , analysts said , trying to call out trump when they believe he crosses a line but also trying to stay in his good graces as the country moves toward exiting the european union
after britain leaves the european bloc , it hopes to strike new trade deals with washington and others
robin niblett , director of chatham house , a london-based think tank , said that many british prime ministers have faced awkward moments with u.s. presidents over the years
but what stood out was the personalized nature of the latest barbs
there have been moments of real tension , surprise and the impression of real damage to u.s.-u.k. relationship in the past , niblett said
we 've had this kind of thing before but not this vituperative backward and forwards , he said
it 's a modern variant , a trump variant , of previous tensions
