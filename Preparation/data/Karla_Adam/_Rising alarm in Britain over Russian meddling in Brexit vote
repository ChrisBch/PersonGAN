the evidence that the russians , with possible support from the kremlin , bombarded british targets with social media tweets and posts was splashed on the nightly news and front pages in britain
even so , the prime minister and her office stressed that russian propaganda had no direct successful influence on the brexit vote
critics of may say an admission that russia tried to dupe british voters could raise questions about the conservative party 's mandate to extricate britain from the european union
the specter of russian meddling also stokes internal discord among the tories , who are divided between those who demand may secure a total , complete exit from europe vs. those advocating a soft brexit
there is also a small but stubborn rearguard of conservatives who say brexit is a historic blunder
labour party politicians blame the prime minister for what appears to be a muddled message on russian meddling
british and spanish leaders say russian trolls meddled in their elections
so i have a very simple message for russia , may warned
we know what you are doing
and you will not succeed
the speech was widely contrasted with president trump 's remarks two days earlier , in which he appeared to defend putin
he said he absolutely did not meddle in our election , trump said
he did not do what they are saying he did
british intelligence agencies have been gathering information on russian active measures and disinformation campaigns before and after the brexit referendum
russia denies meddling in the brexit vote and has suggested it is being used as a scapegoat
british society is currently not going through its finest hour due to the ongoing process of brexit , russia 's foreign ministry tweeted
it is understandable that an external enemy is direly needed to distract public attention for which role russia has been chosen
it is deeply regrettable
asked this month about possible russian interference in british elections , foreign secretary boris johnson replied that nyet , and added there was not a sausage of evidence
and will may now stop dragging her feet and set up the intelligence and security committee to look urgently into the kremlin 's attempts to undermine our democracy
may promised that the parliamentary committee would begin its work that day
but on the question of what johnson knew or did not know , may surprised some when she stressed that in her speech on russian bots and trolls , she had not meant to imply that britain was the target
if they care to look at the speech on monday , may said , they will see that the examples i gave were not in the u.k
britains may slams russia for election meddling and fake news ( unlike president trump )
this prompted head-scratching
on thursday in parliament , labour party lawmaker ben bradshaw said may 's ministers have gone out of their way to avoid talking about russian interference in the brexit vote until now
he suggested that the mounting evidence from intelligence agencies and independent researchers may be forcing her hand
in an interview with the washington post , bradshaw said he was unsure why may was downplaying russian interference in britain
i do n't know whether they are doing this because they would be concerned to do anything that might cast doubt on the legitimacy of the very close referendum result , bradshaw said
or they may be nervous about doing anything that could embarrass the u.s. president , particularly when they seem to be pinning all of their hopes after the disaster of brexit on some fantasy trade deal from the white house
analysts say may is responding to her domestic political realities
i do n't think she wants people to run away with the idea that somehow brexit was caused by the russian federation , said tim bale , a professor of politics at london 's queen mary university
bale said the issue is not black-and-white
yes , he said , there is growing concern regarding russian meddling , but not in the sense that it made any measurable difference in the brexit vote
because there is mounting evidence from various european democracies and the u.s. of interference in their democratic processes , and that 's not something any government or state in the west is prepared to tolerate , he said
in a speech wednesday , ciaran martin , chief executive of the national cyber security center , accused russian hackers of attacking the british media , telecommunications and energy sectors
that is clearly a cause for concern russia is seeking to undermine the international system , he said
british prime minister theresa may offers brexit details in landmark speech
researchers at swansea university in wales and the university of california at berkeley found that more than 150,000 twitter accounts with ties to russia tweeted about brexit in the days before the brexit vote
their findings , which are part of a bigger research project and are not yet published , were first reported in the times of london
commentators have said that the goal may simply have been to sow discord and division in society
a separate study by researchers at the university of edinburgh analyzed the 2,752 accounts that twitter handed over to the u.s. congress
the accounts , now deactivated , were linked to the internet research agency , a st. petersburg troll farm with ties to the russian government
the researchers found that more than 400 of those accounts posted divisive messages about the brexit referendum , the majority after the polls closed
but they also called for caution in trying to determine the influence of the messages on the brexit vote , in part because of limited data access from social media companies such as twitter
to establish the extent to which the brexit debate , or indeed the uk general election , were influenced by such users we need an equivalent list of users seeking to target these specific events and a complete data set , they said
the conservative lawmaker damian collins agrees
he is pressing twitter and facebook to release posts about british politics from russian-linked accounts
the public have a right to know if foreign powers were acting to undermine the democratic process in this country , he said
collins chairs a parliamentary committee that in january launched an investigation into fake news
the committee intends to travel to washington early next year to gather evidence from u.s. tech giants
collins has called on twitter to hand over a list similar to the one given to congress
some of those accounts were posting messages about britain , as well
one of the accounts was a user called southlonestar , which posted a photo of a woman in a headscarf walking on westminster bridge
the tweeter wrongly said that the woman was ignoring victims of a terrorist attack
the tweeter described as a proud texan wrote muslim woman pays no mind to the terror attack , casually walks by a dying man while checking phone prayforlondon westminster banislam
