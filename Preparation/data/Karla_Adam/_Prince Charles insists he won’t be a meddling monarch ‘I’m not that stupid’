london prince charles has especially strong views on many things plastic pollution , modern architecture , organic farming and even the plight of the patagonian toothfish
but the heir to the british throne insists he will stop meddling in controversial or even mainstream issues after he ascends to the throne
im not that stupid , said charles , queen elizabeth iis eldest son , when asked whether he would continue to publicly campaign after he becomes king.
i do realize that it is a separate exercise being sovereign
so of course i understand entirely how that should operate
the comments , which come from a one-hour bbc documentary , prince , son and heir charles at 70 , mark the first time he has publicly addressed concerns that he could be a meddling monarch
unlike his inscrutable mother elizabeth , who can discuss issues like brexit in neutral tones , charles has triggered criticism and praise for his controversial views
perhaps most famously , he once called a planned extension at londons national gallery a monstrous carbuncle.
( the design was later scrapped )
the expected future king also came under scrutiny after the publication of a cache of letters he penned to government ministers dubbed the black spider memos because of charless scrawled handwriting that showed him to be a supporter of a number of causes
charles , who turns 70 next week , is the longest-serving heir apparent in british history
in the bbc documentary , he said that he will operate within constitutional parameters when he becomes monarch , which is a completely different role from being the prince of wales , as the heir in britain is known
he said , according to excerpts from the documentary released ahead of its broadcast thursday evening
while charles said he understood that being king would be different from being heir , he did defend his activism
he said , if thats meddling , im very proud of it.
