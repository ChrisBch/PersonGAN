london even the top players can not stop comparing britain 's clamorous exit from the european union to a divorce , and with each passing week , the process feels more like a marital split
it has been public and embarrassing and messy and that 's just in london
not only are britain and europe tussling over how much should be paid in the divorce bill , but the governing conservative party is roiling with ideological divisions and leadership intrigues , all brought on by brexit
for months , we have been in that stage in the separation where all the parties are taking sides and saying nasty things
whether the serious negotiations can begin will be determined in part by a major speech friday afternoon in florence by british prime minister theresa may
supporters are billing the address as a defining moment , when the embattled tory leader finally will reveal a clear version versus a lot of poll-tested words of where she plans to go with brexit

but there is a ton of drama

alastair campbell , a former labour party spin doctor , described the jousting within the conservative party as leadership psychodrama
britain accused europe of being stubborn and unimaginative , and has threatened to walk away from the table altogether

blair argues that as britons come to learn more about the brexit deal , they should have a chance to change their mind

they make a good point

last week , johnson penned a 4,000-word whopper of an article outlining his vision for brexit , a document that reportedly was unsanctioned by his boss
the manifesto was seen by some as an attempt to undercut may 's highly anticipated speech friday
others said that it was a leadership bid by johnson , an attempt to position himself more favorably with the hard-line brexiteers in his party should there be a sudden vacancy for the top job
if you 're an e.u

kenneth clarke , a senior conservative and an arch-european , accused johnson of exploiting the fact that may no longer has a majority in parliament following her drubbing in the june election
and he knows perfectly well that , normally , a foreign secretary would be sacked instantly for doing that , he told the bbc
vince cable , leader of the liberal democrats , tweeted brexit is the product of a fraudulent , frivolous campaign led by 2 groups of silly public school boys reliving their dormitory pillow fights
there is quite a bit more of this back-and-forth , but you get the idea
