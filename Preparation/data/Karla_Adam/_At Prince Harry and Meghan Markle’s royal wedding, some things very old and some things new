windsor , england it was a modern wedding for a modern british royal couple he a semiretired helicopter pilot , she a retired actress
there was something comforting and traditional in the 15th-century music performed in the 16th-century gothic chapel at windsor castle , but there was a lot of new stuff , too with distinct american moments , and especially african american notes
prince harry and meghan markles wedding went off with nary a glitch
the couple both in their mid-30s will now be known as the duke and duchess of sussex
maybe not a big step up in status for prince harry , but for california girl markle , whose mum is a los angeles yoga instructor and whose father is a retired hollywood lighting director well , thats a leap
about the theme of old and new
there were ruddy-faced , locked-jawed royal family members in morning coats , and a few in top hats
and prince charles looked swell as he walked markle partway down the aisle
the 600 people inside st. georges chapel dutifully stood at the end and belted out the national anthem god save our gracious queen , long live our noble queen
as the queen herself accepted the honors
her majesty was frocked in a delicately flared dress of lime , lemon , purple silk a spring-season popsicle which the 92-year-old monarch managed to pull off
then there was the address , the rousing wake-up-and-praise-jesus sermon by bishop michael curry , the first african american to preside over the episcopal church
within minutes , curry was trending on twitter
his sermon , on the power of love , was heartfelt , theatrical , folksy
not everyone in britain got it
the bbcs cutaways to the perplexed faces of some of the royals were priceless
but it was among the most memorable moments
he said at the beginning
near the end of his remarks , curry got a laugh when he said , with this , ill sit down
we got to get yall married.
markle arrived for the service in a 1950 rolls-royce phantom iv , with her mother , doria ragland , by her side
( one of the sideshows of the past week was whether markles 73-year-old father was well enough to walk his daughter down the aisle as planned
he was not )
markle emerged and the dress was revealed
she wore a simple , elegant wedding gown
fashion reporters called it a confident dress
it was not a sexy dress , but it was a beautiful dress , an assured statement
it was designed by british designer clare waight keller , the first female artistic director at the french fashion house givenchy
kensington palace reported that markle and keller worked closely together on the design
before his brides arrival , the red-bearded prince harry marched with a happy gait toward the chapels west door , alongside his best man , his older brother and the second in line to the throne , prince william , duke of cambridge
both harry and william wore the frock coat uniforms of the blues and royals regiment
bespoke , cut and sewn by hand , harry was wearing his aviator wings and a medal honoring his service as an apache helicopter pilot in afghanistan
harry appeared just a little nervous
meghan was camera-ready
she smiled and hit her marks , like the seasoned professional she is
after the i dos , the couple emerged and boarded an ascot landau carriage , pulled by four windsor grey horses
the horses were lively and they trotted through the streets of windsor town in a fast 25-minute loop that revved up the crowds , though the speed of the procession disappointed some who wanted a longer look after waiting for hours
it was spectacular , jayne ralph , 50 , a retail manager from vancouver , said of the moment the newlyweds passed by
she noted that it was quick , just a few seconds , and suggested that because some people had slept outside overnight , it would have been nice if other royals could have driven by , too , and offered a wee wave
meanwhile , within the castle walls , the guests who had listened on loudspeakers reflected on the service
yvonne roberts , 74 , and her daughter lesley roberts , 50 , said they liked it very much
yvonne said , you just want them to be happy , dont you
the pair sang along with the well-known hymns.
i couldnt hear meghans vows , said yvonne , because of the airplanes.
( windsor castle is on heathrow airports flight path )
she added but i think i said amen at the right moments.
