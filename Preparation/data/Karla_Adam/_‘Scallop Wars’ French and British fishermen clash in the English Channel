london the video footage is dramatic french and british vessels ramming into each other in the middle of the night , fishermen shouting insults , marine flares hurtling through the air
the showdown on tuesday marked an escalation of what have become known as the scallop wars.
the two sides are at odds over who can fish in the waters and when -- an issue they have fought over for well over a decade
in an effort to help replenish scallop stocks , france permits its fishermen to fish in the area only between oct. 1 and may 15
but the british are not subject to the same rules
in the latest installment of the long-running feud , french and british boats clashed in the english channel , just off the coast of france
in the early morning hours , french vessels reportedly chased away british boats from the bay of seine , an area near normandy known for its scallop-rich waters
french officials said there were about 35 french vessels and five british ones caught in the flare-up
said ciaran cardell , 31 , a british fisherman who ultimately fled the scene with the other british boats in the area
he said in a wednesday telephone interview from his boat , which was still at sea but floating closer to england than france
british prime minister theresa may on wednesday said that she hoped for an amicable solution to the dispute
its what we want and its what france wants , and we will be working on that , she told reporters during her visit to nigeria
french officials have said that they will send more boats to police the area , if necessary
scallop war french and british boats clash in channel
for the past several years , the two sides in the wars over the humble scallop came to an agreement larger british vessels those measuring 15 meters and over would stay out of closed french fishing waters in exchange for more fishing rights
but this year that deal broke down
french fishermen accuse the british sailors of having an unfair advantage and plundering their stocks , while the brits counter that they were doing nothing wrong and accuse the french of piracy
normandy fishing chief dimitri rogoff said the french vessels were indeed trying to stop the british from fishing in the waters , but just until the season got started again
he told the bbc.
we dont want to stop them from fishing , but they could at least wait until oct. 1 so that we can share
barrie deas , chief executive of britains national federation of fishermens organizations , said the french actions are dangerous
lieutenant ingrid parrot , a spokeswoman for frances regional maritime authority , said that the incident was worrisome in part because of the proximity of the boats
but she also acknowledged that the french fishermen were frustrated that the british were fishing while they can not
cardell , the british fisherman , said he sympathized with his french counterparts , even if he disapproved of their actions
