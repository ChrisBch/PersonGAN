moscow british foreign secretary boris johnson said friday it was overwhelmingly likely that russian president vladimir putin was behind the poisoning of a russian former spy , the most direct british accusation against the russian leader to date
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov immediately shot back , saying that bringing up putin in the context of the case was shocking and unforgivable in terms of diplomatic behavior.
johnsons comments followed prime minister theresa mays decision wednesday to expel 23 russian diplomats from britain
russia confirmed friday it will expel british diplomats and halt high-level meetings in turn
johnson said during a visit to a museum in london
the poisoning of 66-year-old sergei skripal and his 33-year-old daughter , yulia , in salisbury with a nerve agent identified by british authorities as one made only by russia has thrown the two countries relations into a profound crisis
aside from confirming it would expel some british diplomats , without giving the number , russia has been coy about its potential responses
russian foreign ministry spokesperson maria zakharova told interfax on friday
alexander gabuev , a russian foreign policy analyst with the carnegie moscow center , said the delay is likely related to sundays presidential election
because may delivered the british response , putin will want to deliver russias
new russia sanctions are trumps strongest action against moscow so far
the russian government also has been vague about its response to washingtons expansion of sanctions announced thursday against russian individuals believed to have played a role in alleged cyberattacks and attempts to influence the 2016 u.s. presidential election
russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said friday that moscow would expand its own black list of americans and added that additional measures have not yet been ruled out.
those american politicians are playing with fire , he said
in a separate development friday , london police announced the death of nikolai glushkov , a 68-year-old russian businessman found unresponsive in his london home monday , is being investigated as a murder
a pathologist report identified the cause of death as compression to the neck.
police said in a statement
londons counterterrorism officers are leading the investigation , police said , because of the associations mr glushkov is believed to have had.
he was a close friend of boris berezovsky , a russian dissident who died in mysterious circumstances in 2013
the guardian reported that earlier monday , glushkov had failed to show up at a london court where he was scheduled to defend himself against charges of stealing from the russian state airline aeroflot
russia also announced it would be opening an investigation into glushkovs death
in the salisbury case , russia has focused its efforts on a campaign of denial and counterclaim in which officials at times have contradicted each other
on thursday , ryabkov claimed that russia had never developed anything like the alleged nerve agent , identified by the british as novichok
shortly after , a russian lawmaker charged that the united states stole samples while helping to decommission the facility where novichok was made in the 1990s
most statements have fallen somewhere in between the two extremes
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on friday continued to deny and deflect blame , claiming again that british allegations of russian involvement in skripals poisoning were groundless and anti-russian
he wished the skripals a speedy recovery and said he hopes they can shed light on what happened when they are well
lavrov also lashed out at britain for not providing consular access to yulia skripal , who , along with her father , is in critical condition at a salisbury hospital
later friday , russias investigative committee announced it was opening a criminal investigation into the attempted murder of the younger skripal
what a brave russian scientist told me about novichok
the skripals were found slumped over on a park bench in the cathedral town of salisbury , located near the famed ruins of stonehenge
an officer who attempted to revive them remains in the hospital in stable condition
several areas in the town are still cordoned off as police continue their investigation
writing in the guardian on friday , opposition labour party leader jeremy corbyn called for calm heads and warned against rushing into a new cold war.
he suggested that the possibility that the russians had lost control of the dangerous nerve agent which may floated monday but has since discounted could not be excluded
london is something of a hub for russian expats former dissidents and super-rich oligarchs alike are drawn to its good schoolsand its laws and courts
the wealthiest snap up londons luxury homes for eye-popping prices
anti-corruption advocates say some of that property is bought with questionable funds
a 2017 report by transparency international linked russia to about of fifth or $ 1.3 billion of the suspicious wealth used to purchase london property
analysts say this means britain could go after russian interests
the united states , france and germany on thursday formally backed britains claims that russia likely was responsible for the attack , calling it the first offensive use of a nerve agent in europe since world war ii
it threatens the security of us all , they added , without spelling out any possible further reprisals
