london they are not hard to spot , if you know where to look , especially at night the floors of swanky new apartments , most of the windows dark , almost all the time
the zombie flats
owned , but empty
and on this cobbled mews in chelsea
on that private walk in kensington
no one home , either
the blight of conspicuous empty homeownership is a big story in london and around the globe
but a solution is surprisingly elusive
london faces a crushing shortage of affordable housing , because the city is a global magnet for aspirational newcomers , a safe refuge for stash-your-cash capital and a victim of its own smashing success , even in these anxious brexit days
affordable here being a relative term , where the average price for a flat last year was $ 713,143
it is especially brutal for young people , those in the middle income range and first-time buyers
so london mayor sadiq khan vowed to tax the empties
the rising labour party star , who has sparred with president trump , campaigned on the populist issue of the injustice of foreign ownership and ghost mansions , promising that londoners should get first dibs on new construction
this month , khan appealed to parliament to give london 's local governments new authority to seriously jack up taxes for high-value homes left empty by the international elite
london mayor withdraws support for garden bridge
whether khan 's plan to tax the vacant rich will do much to solve the affordable-housing crunch is unknown
the experts say it is dubious
in part , because the rich are immune from a relatively puny bump in taxes
and it 's not like they will move out of their rarely occupied townhouses and a dozen needy families will move in
the london mayor is not alone in casting about for ways to solve his city 's housing shortage
in manhattan , the new yorker magazine had a look at census bureau numbers , which revealed that in midtown from 49th to 70th streets , between fifth and park avenues nearly 1 in 3 residences are unoccupied at least 10 months a year
newsweek estimated that in paris , one apartment in four sits empty most of the time
in jerusalem , the deputy mayor said the number of ghost flats is triple the official estimate , and bemoaned the impact on young families searching for a bit of living space
but how to stop or slow or tax the empty units is uncharted territory including whether it is even possible or desirable
susan emmett , head of housing and urban regeneration at policy exchange , a london-based think tank , said that the city has a real housing problem but that empty luxury apartments are a scapegoat
you can understand that anger and it 's pretty real , and i can understand khan wants to do something about it
yet it 's not clear that the mayor 's proposals would make a dent
labour leaders have proposed tripling taxes on the highest-end properties from today 's tops of about $ 2,500 to tomorrow 's $ 7,500 a year
a neighborhood feud over a basement highlights a problem for londons super rich
most of london 's 20,000 empty units are n't owned by the super-rich , but by the middle and lower rungs and studies show that most homes are empty because they are the subjects of inheritance tussles or uninhabitable or in need of repairs
when faced with the reports , khan retreated to say that in london , just one home left unoccupied is one too many , which is not much of a campaign slogan
housing experts say khan 's tax plan could hurt the middle class and would probably not change the behavior of the most wealthy absentee owners
scanlon , who wrote one of the reports for the mayor , said she imagines that tripling property taxes for the well-to-do with empty homes will do little
she called proposed bumps trivial for the owners
it 's pocket change for them , scanlon said
studies commissioned by the mayor revealed that the share of entirely empty homes in london overall is actually quite low maybe 1 percent and although 20,000 empty units sounds large , this is a city of almost 9 million residents
still , a lot of the most visible high-end empty property is in central london
ghost mansions and zombie penthouses were once a stealthy phenomenon , propelled by saudi sheikhs and russian oligarchs
they 're still players
britains housing crisis looms large as grenfell fire survivors reckon with whats next
london is struggling to increase the number of affordable homes in a highly politicized environment , where average mortals feel squeezed out of their own city by the moneyed classes and overseas buyers
the inequalities were placed in stark relief after the devastating conflagration in june at grenfell tower , a 24-story public-housing building and a proven firetrap , where at least 80 people died
grenfell tower is in london 's kensington and chelsea borough home to a high number of ghost mansions and a neighborhood of sharp contrast between rich and poor
after the grenfell fire , labour politicians declared it was simply unacceptable that there were 1,652 empty homes in kensington
labour leader jeremy corbyn suggested the properties could be requisitioned if necessary
it ca n't be acceptable that in london we have luxury buildings and luxury flats left empty as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live , corbyn said at the time
on the streets , ordinary residents appear divided
the st. george wharf tower is a gleaming , glassy 50-story apartment complex in london 's vauxhall neighborhood , singled out by the british news media as a vivid symbol of the empty-house crisis
more than half of the homes in the building are in foreign ownership , according to an investigation by the guardian newspaper , and many are barely lived in
nearby residents were n't surprised , nor did they seem to mind
rich foreigners bought apartments that locals could not and brought money into the area
taxing them would n't help solve london 's housing issue , they said
plus , there are upsides to living next to absentee neighbors
i would shudder to imagine if this was running at 80 percent occupancy , said suruchi shukla , a 38-year-old consultant , with her head cranked skyward at the building
james hope , 50 , a personal trainer who lives in the neighborhood , acknowledged that the low occupancy rates meant that local businesses were perhaps not as busy as they could be , but he dismissed khan 's idea of slapping on new taxes
it 's really not a huge problem for me , he said , nodding toward the tower
i 'd much rather spend money on a nice old victorian flat than on something that 's like a hamster cage and costs a few million pounds
so , for me , it 's really not a problem
