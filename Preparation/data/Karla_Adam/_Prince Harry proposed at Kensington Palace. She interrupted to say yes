london he got down on one knee and popped the question at nottingham cottage on the kensington palace grounds , during a cozy dinner of roast chicken at his two-bedroom bachelor pad
she did n't let him finish his proposal before saying yes
the royal family on monday announced that britain 's prince harry is engaged to marry american actress meghan markle , ending days of feverish speculation in the tabloids over when their nuptial plans would be revealed
the 33-year-old redheaded prince is fifth in line to the throne
the 36-year-old markle was born and raised in california
the prince said he tried to warn markle what she was getting into
she said she thought she understood
i know i 'm in love with this girl , and i hope she 's in love with me , the prince said in a television interview after the engagement was announced
but we still have to sit down on the sofa i still have to have some pretty frank conversations with her to say , 'look , this is what you 're letting yourself in for
it 's a big deal
it 's not easy for anybody
i know that at the end of the day , she chooses me , i choose her , and , therefore , whatever we have to tackle together or individually , we will always be us together as a team
markle leaned into harry that 's so nicely said , is n't it
the two sat for a 20-minute chat with the bbc on monday evening
the couple were poised but natural
they held hands
they finished each other 's sentences in a good way
it was the first time they have spoken as a couple , the first venture into this new role of a royal pair
they addressed tabloid culture , race , the legacy of princess diana , the ring , meeting the queen and her corgis , and markle being a foreigner
markle was assertive but gushed a little
the prince appeared a little nervous and cracked a few jokes
children
asked the bbc journalist
not currently , no harry said , grinning
no , of course , you know , one step at a time
hopefully , we will start a family in the near future
the couple will wed in the spring of next year , date and location not yet revealed
the last time an american married into the royal family , britain and the monarchy were plunged into crisis
in 1936 , king edward viii abdicated the throne to marry wallis simpson , a baltimore socialite and divorce
the last time a british royal married an american , it didnt go well
harry confirmed he was dating the actress in november 2016 , when he blasted the tabloid press for subjecting markle to a wave of abuse and harassment
the palace condemned the smear on the front page of a national newspaper , the racial undertones of comment pieces , and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments
markle 's mother is african american , and her father is white
she is divorced , without children from her previous marriage
markle said the scrutiny back then of being prince harry 's girlfriend was hard , especially the initial reports and comments that focused on race
of course it 's disheartening , she said
you know it 's a shame that that is the climate in this world , to focus that much on that
she added , i 'm proud of who i am and where i come from
britains black queen will meghan markle really be the first mixed-race royal
the couple were set up by a mutual friend and met for a drink on what they described as a blind date
both professed they were a little clueless
markle said because i 'm from the states , you do n't grow up with the same understanding of the royal family
and so , while i now understand very clearly there 's a global interest there , i did n't know much about him
markle said she asked her friend only one question was he nice
because if he was n't kind , it did n't seem like it would make sense
the prince confessed , i never even heard of her
in her career , markle is best known for playing the character rachel zane in the new york city legal drama suits , which is filmed in toronto , where markle has been living
harry said i 'd never watched 'suits
i never heard of meghan before
and i was beautifully surprised when i walked into that room and saw her , and there she was sitting there , and i was like , 'okay , i 'm going to have to up my game here
on their third date , they flew away to botswana to sleep in a tent under african stars
markle dutifully showed the cameras her diamond engagement ring
the sparkler was designed by harry
he said he picked yellow gold because it 's markle 's favorite
the main stone was from botswana , and the small diamonds were from princess diana 's collection , to make sure that she 's with us on this on this crazy journey together , harry said
when asked what diana would have made of markle , harry said his mother and his fiancee would have been thick as thieves
he said it 's days like days like today when when i really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news
but you know with the ring and with everything else that 's going on i 'm sure she 's
she 's with us , markle said , finishing harry 's sentence
what the british will make of markle is unknown
the tabloids here can be fickle and cruel
on monday , the british media quickly raised the issue of markle 's race , marital status and nationality
a bbc news alert read american , divorced , an actress and mixed race meghan markle will bring something different to the royal family
the daily mail 's headline said that the queen says she is 'delighted the divorced american actress is to join the royal family
the guardian 's website started one of its live blogs with the tease joy or disdain
follow the reactions to the royal engagement
the media seemed unsure of the british public 's gut reaction to the engagement news , even as most articles asserted that the bride-to-be 's race and nationality were either a good thing or irrelevant
what has obviously changed from previous eras was the public expression of welcome offered by the royal family , with full-throated wishes for happiness , from queen elizabeth ii and down through the ranks
not too long ago , the couple revealed , they went for tea with the 91-year-old monarch , who technically could veto the marriage
apparently , it went just fine
the corgis took to you straight away , harry said
i 've spent the last 33 years being barked at
this one walks in , absolutely nothing
just laying on my feet during tea , it was very sweet , markle said
just wagging tails , harry said , moving his hand back and forth
and i was just like , 'argh
