london there are so many russians here , and so many rich , showy , notorious russians , that it has become a cliche
take your pick
theres a channel 4 documentary about sketchy russians who pay cash for mansions in posh belgravia , and theres a hit bbc soap opera airing now called mcmafia , about the russian mob in london think the sopranos slurping borscht
there are russians who shop for bespoke suits on savile row and others who hoover up the siberian caviar in bob bob ricard , the restaurant with the little button on the table you press to get more champagne
but there are far more ordinary , lumpen russians working as uber drivers or nannies or going to universities or writing software than there are billionaire oligarchs who own english soccer teams
right now , though , in the eyes of the british , the distinctions dont seem to matter
in parliament and the british press , russia is roundly denounced as a source of interfering trolls , money launderers and assassins
and the lives of russian economics majors , sous chefs and kleptocrats in britain are suddenly fraught with new anxieties
critics in london of russian president vladimir putin are reevaluating their need for personal protection
russians with money worry they will be ensnared by new laws going after unexplained wealth.
russians without money say they are being maligned with stereotypes
suddenly , exile is not as comfortable , their adopted home not so welcoming
britain has poked its finger directly at the kremlin for attempted murder
prime minister theresa may called the hit utterly barbaric.
russia denies any wrongdoing
instead , its embassy in kensington tweets sarcasm about british bungling and how agatha christies fictional detective hercule poirot should be called in
this week , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told the bbc that relations with the west are worse than during the cold war
british officials agree
feeling the chill are the tens , or more likely hundreds , of thousands of russian-speakers who live in london and britain
yevgeny chichvarkin knows well the stereotype of russians in london.
they think we are all oligarchs , he said
corrupt , suspicious
chichvarkin has been in london almost 10 years
hes rich , creative , outspoken , wears an earring and red shoes
he lives in chelsea , with his wife and children
he is the founder of a wine emporium in mayfair called hedonism , which offers some of the rarest , most expensive vintages in the city bottles worth tens of thousands of dollars
he insists , i am not the cliche russian.
chichvarkin fled moscow in december 2008 with a target on his back , he said
in russia , he co-founded and ran yevroset , a countrywide discount chain of 5,000 mobile-phone stores , until he was forced into exile , accused by putins officials of kidnapping , a charge he has called ridiculous
hes never gone home , not once , not for his mothers funeral
we met for breakfast at chichvarkins latest venture , a newly opened upscale restaurant and destination bar , with an extensive wine cellar , facing green park in london
its called hide.
he was a little hung over , he apologized
the day before was the russian orthodox churchs easter sunday
he showed mobile-phone photos of his rabbit meatballs and a row of empty wine and champagne bottles
hed had dear friends over
hes an atheist
still , they went a little nuts
chichvarkin said there are three types of russians in london those who are allied with putin those , like himself , who are opposed and a lot of people who dont say anything
we are well-educated , wealthy , cultured people anti-putin , anti-totalitarian , he said
this is his circle
they go to poetry readings and concertos , not performances by headbanger russian djs
chichvarkin sipped on his second glass of tomato juice with salt
he said britons who hear his accent or know who he is have told him , uninvited , your government is a bunch of bloody bastards.
he said he doesnt take it personally
does he think the russian state poisoned the skripals
sure , they did it , he said
they killed the former russian spy alexander litvinenko with a dose of radioactive polonium-210 in 2006 , chichvarkin said , repeating the conclusion of the british government , and suffered no sustained consequences
hes a traitor , he said , of the double agent skripal.
its the worst thing in their minds.
what will happen now
nothing , he said.
just blah , blah , blah.
chichvarkin said he lives without bodyguards
he is revisiting this topic
sergey buravlev , editor of the profile russia news website , said that since the skripal attack , brits have approached him asking why are you russians killing russians
arthur doohan , co-founder of clampk , an anti-corruption initiative , welcomes the scrutiny
doohan runs kleptocracy tours of london , pointing out opulent homes purchased with suspect funds
standing in belgrave square dubbed billionaire row in the tabloids he noted that the homes owned by russian oligarchs are almost always empty , save for visits by the cleaning staff
while london is awash with cash from rich foreigners not just russians doohan said its often easier to spot russian money
real estate brokers and property sellers in britain , and london in particular , have gorged themselves on russian and overseas investments , based on lax laws and easy access to friendly offshore holding companies
katya zenkovich , who helps russian clients acquire properties in london , says the vast majority of russians arent millionaires seeking to shelter money , but professionals drawn by britains private education system
the british government has said that frosty relations should not impact ordinary russians living in britain
foreign secretary boris johnson warned people not to engage in russophobia.
as the skripal investigation moves forward , as sergei or yulia skripal remember more about the day they were poisoned and police couple those recollections with the 5,000 hours of closed-circuit surveillance video in salisbury , the atmosphere for russians in britain might grow worse
