london the gleaming new u.s. embassy in london opened tuesday with little fanfare and no official ribbon cutting
president trump sparked a furor here last week when he tweeted that he was not coming to open the $ 1 billion building the most expensive embassy ever built because it was a bad real estate deal and in an off location
many neighborhood residents took offense at trump 's description of the site the president had unwittingly inserted himself into the long-running rivalry between londoners north and south of the river thames but others said the former new york real estate mogul had a point
the new embassy is in nine elms , a former industrial area along the south bank of the thames that is being radically redeveloped
the neighborhood is a short walk away from ultraposh chelsea , and when its upmarket residential , commercial and leisure spaces are completed , it will be a major extension to central london
nearby vauxhall has been gentrifying fast in recent years
in interviews outside the embassy and elsewhere in nine elms on tuesday , it was clear that one person 's off location is another person 's up-and-coming
early in the day , the first on which the embassy officially opened to the public , a small queue formed outside the entrance for consular services
landscaping workers were busy at their tasks
i can see why someone would say it 's an off location , sheron cloyd , 41 , a project manager from new york , said over the roar of a chain saw
it 's not in the city center
it 's south of the river
glee in london over trumps scrapped visit but also unease about u.s.-british ties
but cloyd , who also lives south of the river , said the area around the embassy has become fashionable in recent years
when i first moved here , someone said vauxhall used to be horrible
it 's very expensive and trendy , kind of like brooklyn , he said
like others in the line , he got off the train at the vauxhall station , about a 10-minute walk from the embassy
the old mission was located in a history-steeped square in mayfair , one of london 's most exclusive neighborhoods
but if mayfair is the place of yesterday and today , nine elms could arguably be the place of tomorrow
it 's still not completely developed , but it soon will be , said tony travers , a london expert at the london school of economics
he said that moving from an established area such as mayfair and buying property in an area where the value will almost certainly rise represented quite a good deal
it 's the u.s. government getting in on the act , he said
u.s. officials said the move was necessitated by new safety standards imposed after the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks in the united states
trump 's tweet last week played into a familiar routine of one-upmanship here
donald trump cancels london trip after discovering he 'd have to go south of the river , read one headline on a satirical website
over the centuries , as in many cities , london 's rich have clustered in the cleaner areas
because nine elms had an enormous , coal-fired power station belching out soot until the 1980s , it did not make the cut as a desirable area
today , the battersea power station is part of the $ 21 billion nine elms development project , one of the largest such schemes in europe
yakine abdullah , 22 , a business management student from iraq who was waiting outside the new embassy , said the area is not just up-and-coming , it is flourishing
it 's my favorite area to live in , she said
as usual , hes dead wrong former u.s. ambassadors explain london embassy move after trump criticism
nine elms is part of the london borough of wandsworth , where the council leader disputed trump 's characterization of the area
nine elms is very much london 's most exciting destination with a huge amount to offer , ravi govindia said in a statement posted on the council 's website
he noted that two new subway stations are slated for the area and that penguin random house and apple uk have announced plans to move in
the netherlands is also considering moving its embassy to the area
henry pryor , a london property expert , said that when u.s. officials announced in 2008 that they had purchased a site in nine elms , he was surprised
it was like hearing about prospectors heading west , he said
other than fantastic views , he added , the area at the time was desperately unfashionable with little to commend it
now , though , pryor said , he looks forward to the new u.s. embassy blazing a trail in nine elms
