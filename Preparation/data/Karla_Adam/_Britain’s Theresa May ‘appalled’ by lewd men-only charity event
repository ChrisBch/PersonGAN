london british prime minister theresa may said thursday she was appalled by disclosures of an all-male charity party that saw drunken british businessmen and others groping young women hired as hostesses
i thought that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was something that was in the past , may told bloomberg television at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , saying she was frankly appalled by the reports
sadly , what that event showed is that there is still a lot more work for us to do , the prime minister said
may 's remarks underscored the domino-style fallout since the financial times printed an explosive expos wednesday on the presidents club charitable trust , which for 33 years has organized a men-only fundraising dinner at london 's exclusive dorchester hotel to benefit children 's causes
about 360 men attended the party , served by 130 hostesses , who were invited to drink heavily and mingle with the guests at the dinner and after parties in the hotel bars
the newspaper 's investigation said the young women , required to wear sexy shoes and short tight black dresses , were groped and propositioned
one older attendee pointedly asked a hostess if she was a prostitute
other women were pulled onto the laps of braying guests and had men 's hands reaching under their skirts
not just london men-only clubs found across europe
hours after the newspaper 's report was made public , the charity announced it was closing and donating any remaining assets
earlier , the club president , david meller , resigned from a senior post in the department of education
in parliament , lawmakers piled on denunciations that were quickly splashed across social media under metoo and other movements drawing attention to abuses against women
it is quite extraordinary to me
in the 21st century that allegations of this nature are still emerging , said anne milton , education minister in the conservative government , during a session wednesday
the prime minister was asked by bloomberg tv what should be done
this is about attitudes , may said
it 's about saying that actually women are not objects just to be used by men
actuallym we are equals we have our own position , our own abilities
may 's de facto deputy , damian green , was also investigated for having pornography on a work computer
in a round of interviews , however , may defended nadhim zahawi , her government 's minister for children and families , who attended the charity dinner
may told the bbc in davos i understand that nadhim zahawi left early from that particular event
pressed if zahawi should have been there at all , may sidestepped the question
i 'm not happy with an event of that type taking place , she said
what worries me is that it is not just about that event it is what it says about this wider issue in society about attitudes to women
among the prizes auctioned off to the attendees was a luncheon with foreign secretary boris johnson
the prime minister 's spokesman told the guardian that johnson had initially donated his time for another charity auction , but the gift of a lunch had been transferred without his knowledge
the financial times investigation also revealed that the hostesses , who were paid about $ 200 for the night , were required to sign without reading long and legalistic nondisclosure agreements
the prime minister 's office said it will review how nondisclosure agreements are used in light of the presidents club scandal
it did not say how the agreements might be studied or what the government might do to regulate them
in the harvey weinstein sexual harassment and assault scandal , the hollywood producer and his lawyers often secured women 's silence by employing nondisclosure agreements
