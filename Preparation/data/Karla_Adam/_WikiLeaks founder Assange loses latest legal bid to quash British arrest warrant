london julian assange lost one legal bid tuesday that could have dramatically altered the long-running saga that has compelled the controversial wikileaks founder to take refuge in the ecuadoran embassy in london for more than five years
but his case continues , with more hearings and court dates to come
a british judge rejected his lawyers first argument that an existing arrest warrant against assange should be withdrawn because the swedish charges that underlie it have been shelved
lawyers for assange argued in a london courtroom that the outstanding british warrant , issued after he skipped bail , had lost its purpose and function following swedens decision last year to drop an investigation into sexual assault allegations
im not persuaded that the warrant should be withdrawn , judge emma arbuthnot said in her ruling
the judge said

the judge agreed that assanges legal team could make a public-interest argument and set another hearing on the matter for feb. 13
assange has been staying virtually imprisoned , he says at the ecuadoran embassy for five years
ecuadoran authorities have indicated that he has worn out his welcome there
he was granted asylum by ecuadors previous president , leftist rafael correa
but president lenn moreno , who took office in may 2017 , has been trying to steer a more centrist course and improve relations with the united states and europe
if assange steps off embassy grounds , he faces arrest for skipping bail in 2012 when he sought refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to sweden , where he was wanted for questioning about alleged sex crimes

last year , sweden dropped its investigation into rape allegations against assange because it was unable to get access to him
ahead of tuesdays ruling , a small group of assange supporters gathered outside the court in central london
some carried placards reading assange safe passage and dont shoot the messenger.
it is not publicly known whether there is a sealed u.s. indictment against assange
assange has been living in a tiny room in the ecuadoran embassy , and his organization continues to release sensitive documents on the internet
born in australia , the 46-year-old recently was granted ecuadoran citizenship in a bid by the countrys president to end the embassy standoff
but britain refused to grant assange safe passage so he could leave the country , citing the outstanding arrest warrant

during the 2016 presidential campaign , wikileaks published a trove of emails from the democratic national committee and john d. podesta , hillary clintons campaign chairman
last year , wikileaks released documents detailing u.s. government hacking tools
cia director mike pompeo has denounced the anti-secrecy group as a nonstate hostile intelligence service and a threat to u.s. national security
he also suggested that assange can not protect those who pass him classified information
in a recent interview with the washington post , assange called pompeos statements very strange and bombastic.
in the past year , assange also has been active in a campaign to support secessionists in the catalonia region of spain
