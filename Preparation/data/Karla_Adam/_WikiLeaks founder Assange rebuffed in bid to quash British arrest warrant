london julian assange on tuesday lost a second bid to quash a british arrest warrant , another setback for the wikileaks founder , who has spent almost six years holed up in the ecuadoran embassy in london
judge emma arbuthnot denied a request by assanges lawyers to lift a british warrant that was issued after assange jumped bail when swedish authorities sought him for questioning about sexual assault allegations
the swedish case was dropped last year , but the arrest warrant for skipping bail in 2012 by seeking refuge in ecuadors embassy still holds , the judge ruled
assange has strongly denied the swedish accusations
in londons westminster magistrates court , assange sought to have the british warrant lifted , saying it no longer served the public interest
assanges lawyers argued that their client was justified in his actions because of fears that he would be extradited to the united states to face possible charges for his role in wikileaks dissemination of troves of highly classified u.s. documents
they also said the five years that assange has spent holed up in the embassy amounted to adequate , if not severe , punishment for skipping bail
the lawyers cited a u.n. panel on detentions that described assange as arbitrarily detained.

but arbuthnot was withering in her responses in writing and in her courtroom remarks
the judge said
after the ruling , assange claimed there were significant factual errors in the judgment and suggested he might appeal
there are 3 months to appeal judges decision , he wrote in a tweet
the judge also dismissed his arguments that sweden would have extradited him to the united states
and risk touching off a diplomatic crisis involving britain , sweden and the united states
the judges decision came after assange lost a separate legal challenge last week
in that ruling , his lawyers argued that the arrest warrant should be dropped because it had lost its purpose after sweden shelved its investigation into sexual assault allegations because it could not get access to him
even if the bail arrest warrant were lifted , it is unknown whether assange would leave the embassy and where he would go in that event
it is also unclear whether he would immediately face extradition requests if he stepped outside the embassy , which is monitored by security cameras
