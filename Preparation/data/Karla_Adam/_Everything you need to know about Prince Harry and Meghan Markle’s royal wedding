london this is a thing britain does really well
the monarch virtually invented pomp
you want regal pageantry , gilded spectacle , the royal ascot landau carriage pulled by a pair of father-and-son windsor grey horses
the archbishop of canterbury bedecked in his robes , the choir of st. georges chapel belting out the choral anthems to the rafters plus maybe a little elton john
on saturday , prince harry and meghan markle and a supporting cast of thousands are going to roll out red carpets and stage one performance only , televised live their big fat royal wedding
were being treated to the full-on fairy tale , complete with a pint-size prince and princess as page boy and bridesmaid
because its 2018 , windsor castle will be festooned with locally sourced foliage , including pollinator-friendly plants from the royal parks meadows
the wedding cake at the first of two receptions will be a tower of lemon elderflower covered in buttercream
there will be the reveal of the dress
the kensington palace pr squad will blast the details
then prince charles , harrys father , will walk his future daughter-in-law down the aisle
markles father , thomas markle , is sidelined because of heart problems and media-induced stress
cue the state trumpeters
the bbc national orchestra
karen gibson and the kingdom choir doing american-style gospel
bishop michael curry , the first african american to preside over the episcopal church , is to deliver a sermon
archbishop of canterbury justin welby will perform the wedding ceremony with the vows from the book of common prayer
and good for britain
theyve earned it
the barely united kingdom has been sagging under the gray winter weight of petty tory intrigues , russian spy poisonings and interminable brexit negotiations over cod fisheries and customs unions ( whatever they are )
for one glorious day , its not dreary theresa may
its may 19 , and the british meteorological office is forecasting ( knock on wood ) sunny skies and 70-degree fahrenheit temperatures
because this is , seriously , designed from top to bottom to be entertainment
but one thing to keep in mind is that prince harry will never , ever , never be king
his father , prince charles , and brother , prince william , are likely to be and then his brothers three kids and counting are in line
so its all chill
and the brits love harry
good on you , mate
harry is the favorite , the big lovable royal family labrador
a bit of weed , the vegas nudes and a nazi costume
all mostly forgotten since he grew up and flew combat missions as a helicopter pilot in afghanistan
harrys the strong but sensitive type , man enough to talk about mental health on television
and meghan markle
the royal family , in all its cunning , clinging to the faded role of modern monarch , could not have invented a better first mate in a laboratory below buckingham palace
is it possible this american tv actress might just save this tired brand
shes the new thing
the season 2 surprise
the british tabloids are not quite sure what to make of markle
shes the whole package a tested media performer , a proven clothes horse and a thoughtful , eloquent woman who supports the metoo moment
markle arrives ready to stand on her mark
in their first dual appearances the sort of engagements that constitute the royal familys day job meghan has proved herself better at the game than harry
of course , were all old enough now to know that fairy tales are for children
harrys mother , princess diana , was sucked up into the paparazzi whirlwind and she died when harry was just 12 , killed by a bad chauffeur chased by photographers paid to feed our celebrity obsessions
dickie arbiter , the queens former press secretary , said he thinks harry and meghan together will be able to create a stable life , even in these surreal environs something harry never had
arbiter said , noting that harry as a boy split his time between his mothers residence at kensington palace in london and his fathers highgrove house in gloucestershire
the retired courtier said
so cheers to that
