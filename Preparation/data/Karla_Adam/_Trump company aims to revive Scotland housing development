president trumps company said tuesday that it wants to revive long-dormant plans to build hundreds of new homes near an existing trump golf course in aberdeen , scotland
in a press release , the trump organization said it wants to build 500 homes , 50 hotel cottages , an equestrian center and retail facilities near the golf course , which opened in 2012
if the trump organization succeeds in building this planned development , it would be the largest expansion of the presidents own real estate empire since trump took office
since inauguration day last year , the trump brand has appeared on a new golf course in dubai and a new hotel in vancouver , b.c
but those were both licensed properties , meaning that somebody else owns them and pays trump to use his name
the aberdeen golf course is owned by trump himself , and it appeared the planned development next to it would be , as well
the course located on a chilly , foggy section of scotlands northeast coast is the lesser-known of trumps two scottish courses
trump also owns the famed turnberry course , in scotlands opposite corner
when trump visited scotland this month during a presidential trip , he went to turnberry
in aberdeen , trump has promised a major expansion since he bought the course in 2006 , including two golf courses and thousands of homes
so far , he has built just one course and a small luxury hotel
the rest of the plans were put on hold , due in part to furious local opposition and a downturn in the local north sea oil industry
in the meantime , the course like turnberry has lost money consistently under trumps ownership
recent financial filings with the british government showed that trump has now spent at least $ 62 million on the aberdeen course , all in cash , without turning a profit
now trumps company said it would return to part of the older plans to expand aberdeen
the company said it planned to spend more than $ 190 million to create a residential and recreational complex called the trump estate
it promised to create thousands of construction jobs
eric trump , the presidents son , said in a press release
although president trump still owns his company , he said last year that he was handing over day-to-day control of the trump organization to his sons and other executives
in its press release , trumps company said it had submitted a detailed application to a local government body , the aberdeenshire council
trump has battled scottish authorities over land-use and zoning issues before , with mixed results
he won permission to build his aberdeen course in 2008 , after appealing to scotlands top politician
but he lost his effort to stop an offshore wind farm planned near the course
the wind farm began generating power this month
if there is a political fight over this new proposal , trumps company may enter with far less political capital
during his turnberry visit this month , locals staged protests , and the daily record newspaper greeted him with a cover reading , we dont want you.
in aberdeen , trumps course also has been criticized for its impact on treasured sand dunes nearby
