london boris johnson blasted prime minister theresa mays compromise plan for britains exit from the european union in a resignation speech in parliament on wednesday , claiming her proposal would leave britain in miserable , permanent limbo.
johnson , a conservative member of parliament and rival of mays who quit as foreign secretary last week , urged the prime minister to push for a strong , independent , self-governing britain.
it is rare for ministers to deliver such a speech in parliament
johnson was a leading brexiteer in the 2016 e.u
he was also the face of vote leave the official pro-brexit campaign group that was recently fined for breaking electoral law by overspending almost $ 600,000
when johnson announced his intent to speak , some commentators wondered whether his address might be something akin to the 1990 resignation speech by geoffrey howe that preceded the downfall of margaret thatcher as prime minister
in the end , johnsons speech didnt appear to be the doomsday speech for may that some had feared
but it did underscore how bitterly divided parliament is over brexit and the type of relationship britain wants with the e.u
after it leaves the bloc in march
johnson didnt attack may directly he noted her courage and resilience.
his remarks are nonetheless a headache for the british leader , who is trying to rally support for her brexit plan , which would see britain remain closely aligned with the e.u
on trade rules for goods ( though not services )
johnson said that mays plan would mean that britain would have much less scope to strike free trade deals around the world
but its unclear who would replace her
johnson is widely considered to have leadership ambitions , yet hes not as popular as he once was
he didnt signal an imminent leadership challenge or call on may to resign on wednesday
in the past 18 months , johnson said , it is as though a fog of self-doubt has descended.
