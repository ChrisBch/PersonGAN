london during a fretful hour friday afternoon , londoners braced for confirmation of yet another attack , something that has become familiar in the british capital this year
amid rumors of gunshots , shoppers fled down oxford street , one of the busiest retail districts in the world on one of the busiest shopping days of the year
in the end , it appeared to be a false alarm
london 's metropolitan police said they could not find evidence of shots fired or casualties
the police said that at 4:38 p.m. , they received several calls reporting gunshots in the area
given the nature of the info received we responded as if the incident was terrorism , the police said in a tweet
armed officers poured into the crowded oxford street area in the heart of london and ordered people to take shelter
the scenes in the ensuing hour were ones of panic
video from oxford circus uploaded to social media showed pedestrians fleeing the area as armed police officers arrived
many people jumped on twitter and other social media sites to say that they were holed up in nearby department stores and offices
emily hooper , 39 , was one of hundreds of people who work in the area whose offices were in lockdown as police scrambled to figure out what was happening
we heard so many different stories it 's quite frustrating , she said minutes after she was let out of her building
she said there were rumors of gunshots and of a truck mowing down pedestrians
it 's just madness that people say that kind of stuff when it 's not actually happening
it fuels the frenzy and fear and stampede that follows
after a little more than an hour of instructing londoners to stay inside , police gave an all-clear signal
several attacks this year have put england 's capital city on edge
in september , a homemade bomb was detonated on a subway car at the parsons green station , injuring nearly 30 commuters
three vehicle attacks , one in march and two in june , left 12 people dead and dozens of others wounded
minutes after the police lifted the cordon around oxford street , normal life resumed
the parked double-decker buses started up their engines
some storekeepers opened their shops
thousands of people carrying shopping bags flooded back into the area to seek out black friday sales
but there were still signs of the panic that gripped the area earlier
at h & m , for instance , the doors remained locked as staff swept up broken glass that covered the floor
another store also remained closed as staff cleaned up plant vases that had been smashed
outside , a pair of shoes was abandoned on the sidewalk
hooper acknowledged that the city felt jittery even before the incident friday
but at the end of the day , she said , londoners just get on with daily life you just have to keep carrying on
you ca n't not live
