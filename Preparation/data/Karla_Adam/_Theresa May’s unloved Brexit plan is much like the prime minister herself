london it can be painful to watch , the sneers and scoffing heaped upon the lonely prime minister and yet she soldiers on and on
because this is her brexit
whatever happens next , good or bad , in this remarkable british moment will happen because of theresa may
the vicars daughter from maidenhead says she is doing the right thing , not the easy thing.
may insists that she is the one to see this through.
those who have watched her over the years say it is mays governing style , her character , her way of seeing the world that have produced this version of brexit , as much as any red lines drawn by european negotiators
may can be both notoriously steadfast or stubborn , take your pick , as well as secretive and tough , according to allies and critics
she can be a wooden campaigner , an uninspiring orator who sticks to a script
theres nothing soaring or flamboyant about her , except her leopard-print shoes
she cant abide talking about her feelings , especially on the bbc
she listens , studies , decides and then cant be moved
she is all about details , about process
may is not a big-picture person
and so this considered , cautious brexit , practical and provincial , is very much like the prime minister herself
it is miles away from the kind of cinematic , swashbuckling , go-for-it , global britain brexit that former foreign secretary boris johnson craved
that is why mays brexit is anathema to the hardcore tory brexiteers who this past week threatened a parliamentary coup , a no-confidence vote that would seek to strip her of power because mays vision tethers britain to e.u
rules and regulations for years
the plot against her appears to have fizzled , at least for now , with its plummy patrician leader in a bespoke double-breasted suit , jacob rees-mogg , now cast as fool
and yet , may remains
her brexit deal has survived the past two tumultuous weeks
that is saying something
the nearly 600-page withdrawal agreement , which spells out the terms for britains exit from the e.u
on march 29 , is scheduled to be voted on by the leaders of the remaining 27 e.u
member states on sunday in brussels
the europeans are expected to pass the plan in 90 minutes , barring derailment over fishing rights or the future status of gibraltar
then the withdrawal agreement would return for a december vote in the british parliament , where again its critics say mays plan is doomed
but is it , really
after her deal was savaged last week in parliament where barely a soul stood to support her may confessed to the daily mail that it had been a pretty heavy couple of days.
the 62-year-old prime minister said her husband , philip , her rock , made beans on toast and poured her a large welsh whisky and then she carried on
alan duncan , a conservative party member of parliament who went to oxford university with may , told the prime minister he did not know how she could take the abuse heaped on her in the house of commons
duncan told the washington post
shipman said he saw a cabinet minister earlier this week who told him any man would have resigned if he had gone through what she has
her most persistent competitor , johnson , quit the government in disgust in july over mays brexit plans
now a backbencher and telegraph columnist , johnson most recently wrote that the prime ministers proposed deal under a headline calling it an appalling sell-out does nothing to cover the embarrassment of our total defeat.
johnson was just one of 20 government officials to abandon may to her fate
his brother jo johnson , who voted to remain in the e.u
her former brexit secretary dominic raab , who also abruptly resigned , said friday that mays deal is even worse than remaining in the e.u
those who know may best , including former top aides , say the prime minister never subscribed to the idea that brexit could be a glorious rebirth
instead she has sought to mitigate possible disaster after britons voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the worlds richest free-trade zone
her language reveals a defensive brexit , a least-worst brexit , an anxious brexit , a better-than-nothing brexit
at least it ends the damaging uncertainty , is the way a financial times column put it
it may very well be the best available deal the europeans would give her , but nobody seems to be very inspired by it
nick timothy , one of mays former key aides , inveighed against mays deal as a capitulation in the pages of the daily telegraph
timothy was never far from mays side until he was forced out when may stumbled in the last elections
either way , timothy warned , it has no chance in the commons.
but he would not be the first to get the math wrong about may
rosa prince , author of theresa may the enigmatic prime minister , said that mays uncompromising , dig-your-heels-in style has not always gone down well with colleagues at westminster but that the public has come to admire her grit
what may wants is respect , which is more important to her than being liked , prince said
