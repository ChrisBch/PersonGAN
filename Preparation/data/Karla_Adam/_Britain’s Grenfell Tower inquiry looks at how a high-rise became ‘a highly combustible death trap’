london britains highly charged official inquiry into the causes of last years deadly grenfell tower fire began this week in a cramped room filled with the bereaved and a lot of lawyers
testimony by experts quickly revealed that one failure after another likely contributed to the deaths of 72 residents
water pressure for the fire hoses was low
systems to vent smoke failed
firefighters urged people to stay put in their apartments rather than run for their lives
perhaps worst of all , the building materials used to refurbish the facades of the 24-story public housing building a year earlier were combustible and apparently had not been subjected to rigorous british fire tests
grenfell tower lit like a torch
london fire brigade commissioner dany cotton told the inquiry this week
the inferno on june 14 , 2017 , was an astonishingly fast , highly aggressive and unusual event
before the flames were extinguished , the tragedy ignited a political crisis in britain , with a story line emerging about extreme inequality
among those killed in the fire were immigrants , children , the elderly , the poor and their pets most of them trapped by smoke and flames on the upper floors , hours after the first firefighters arrived
this happened in one of the wealthiest boroughs of london , where the average selling price for a home last year was almost $ 3 million
as prime minister theresa may and her conservative party scrambled to respond and as condemnation rained down on the local tory-led counsel in the royal borough of kensington and chelsea some wondered whether the government might fall
or whether the lasting image of may would be something akin to the photograph of president george w. bush flying in air force one over hurricane-ravaged new orleans and later complimenting his disaster chief for doing a heck of a job.
now , survivors are openly challenging authorities to explain why their public housing block was , in the words of one fire brigade union representative , a highly combustible death trap.
lawyers for the families from grenfell said it was inhumane for the local council , which oversees public housing , and its contractors to withhold information
one attorney alleged that people in london live or die in fires depending on their race
modern buildings are specifically designed not to spontaneously combust but to contain fire , room by room , floor by floor
but a chilling time-lapse video , recorded by onlookers and shown in the inquiry room this week , showed grenfell tower quickly swaddled in flame
onlookers are heard crying out to those inside , get out
get out
seeing it , some survivors and relatives of the dead sobbed , others slumped in their seats
these were their family members and friends
inquiry chair martin moore-bick , a retired justice of the court of appeal of england and wales , called the video truly shocking.
lead counsel richard millett warned the designers , builders , suppliers and decision-makers not to indulge in a merry-go-round of buck passing.
but no one was accepting any responsibility
the government-sponsored , independent inquiry now underway is charged with examining the circumstances leading to the fire and its aftermath
the panel promises to establish facts and make recommendations to prevent a similar tragedy
this will take months or years
such high-level inquiries in britain are rare and have a checkered past
a string of coroners inquests , police investigations and independent panel reports into the deaths of 96 fans in 1989 at the hillsborough soccer stadium in sheffield they died in a crushing stampede took years to complete
it was not until 2017 that the first charges of manslaughter by gross negligence were filed
the first week of grenfell testimony laid out a jaw-dropping cascade of failure from the proper testing of rain cladding products , to enforcing building codes and basic fire safety measures , to what one authority called a culture of non-compliance.
before 1 a.m. on june 14 , an ethiopian-born cabdriver named behailu kebede called 999 to report a fire in his kitchen on the fourth floor
he begged firefighters to come quick , quick , quick.
firefighters were on scene by 12:54 a.m. and doused the fire in kebedes apartment , but it appears that flames had already spread through his open window and were crawling up the side of the building
the exterior cladding , installed in 2016 to improve the energy efficiency and appearance of the 1970s-era concrete building , contained a flammable core , and its installation , with gaps and spaces , beside combustible insulation , might have made things worse
( grenfell-style cladding is wrapped around more than 200 other buildings in britain )
the makers of the cladding blamed the window makers conceding only that their product was , at most , a contributing factor in the fire
the window fabricators said they would not offer their own report until they were granted access to grenfell tower , which is still a crime scene
fire safety experts testified that doors to each apartment were not fireproofed as they should have been
emergency overrides for elevators stopped working
ventilation systems did not do their job
there was no intercom to alert residents
there were no sprinklers
it is a fact that some of those who disobeyed fire officers and abandoned their apartments , stumbling through the boiling black smoke down slippery stairwells , over dead or dying bodies , did survive , as their accounts reveal
at that point , 107 people were still inside , of whom only 36 eventually got out
the bereaved , survivors and residents known to the inquiry as the bsrs desperately want someone held to account
the grenfell fire inquiry is not a criminal or civil trial , but the evidence gathered will clearly inform both
the metropolitan police are conducting their own investigation , which could lead to fines or even charges of individual or corporate manslaughter , or worse
ahead of the official testimony , the inquiry devoted seven days to commemorations of the victims
relatives read emotional statements
pictures and videos were projected onto a large screen
and the 72 people who died were not just names , but real people , with personalities and hopes and dreams
grief counselors moved about the room , comforting those who were openly weeping
among the dead was firdaws hashim , a 12-year-old who had recently won a debating competition and was handed her award by bill gates
when a video of her and her family was shown , many broke down in tears
isaac paulos , 5 , also died in the fire
his father paulos tekle spoke about his guilt for listening to the fire departments advice to stay put.
he told the inquiry
