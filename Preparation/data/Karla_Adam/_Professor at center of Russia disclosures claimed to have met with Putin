london he was , he insisted , just an academic who had absolutely no contact with the russian government
any suggestion that he had offered to play matchmaker between the future president of the united states and the power players of the kremlin was , he maintained dismissively , incredible
or so he told reporters
the assistant did n't think much of that claim
but the boastfulness matches the portrait of mifsud sketched in court papers unsealed monday that have made him one of the most critical and enigmatic figures in special counsel robert s. mueller iii 's investigation into russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election
who is in the george papadopoulos court documents
in those papers a plea agreement for former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos mifsud is not named
but the maltese national and london-based academic confirmed tuesday that he is the professor mentioned in the probe
according to the court files , the professor took an interest in papadopoulos after the latter joined the trump campaign
mifsud promised him dirt on hillary clinton compiled by the russians , including thousands of emails
he also offered to serve as a go-between in papadopoulos 's efforts to connect the trump campaign with the kremlin , even going so far as introducing papadopoulos to a woman he identified as putin 's niece
whether mifsud really had the sort of kremlin contacts that papadopoulos claims he advertised is unknown
but the question of how the trump campaign regarded mifsud 's apparent approach , and whether it yielded anything substantive , could be a key focus of mueller 's investigation
mifsud , who is in his mid-50s , insisted tuesday that the claims embedded in the court documents are exaggerated , echoing points he had made months earlier in response to inquiries from the washington post
i have a clear conscience , mifsud told britain 's daily telegraph
mifsud told the telegraph that he knew nothing about emails containing dirt on clinton , calling the allegations upsetting
he also dismissed the disclosure that he introduced papadopoulos to a female russian national , calling the allegation a laughingstock
in emails to the post in response to questions in august , mifsud had played down his connections to moscow , insisting they were purely related to his work as a professor
i am an academic , i do not even speak russian , he wrote
hailing from malta , the european union 's smallest nation , he parlayed roles advising the government there into top positions with educational institutions that bear exalted-sounding names but are little-known even within academia
those included president of the slovenia-based euro-mediterranean university and honorary director at the london academy of diplomacy
natalia kutepova-jamom , his onetime assistant at the academy , said he had set out in 2014 to build his contacts with russian academics and policymakers
mifsud later suggested to her that he used those early contacts to open doors for higher-level meetings
but she was in disbelief when he told her last year that his contacts had reached all the way to putin , with whom mifsud claimed to have had a short private meeting
she said she did n't believe the two met because mifsud is a too 'small-time person to meet with the russian leader
but mifsud himself had written about being in the room with putin to hear him speak at a 2015 event hosted by the valdai discussion club , and reported that he had asked a question of foreign minister sergei lavrov
in that piece , for valdai 's website , he wrote approvingly of russia 's policy in syria , saying putin had walked the talk
the u.s. administration of then-president barack obama , by contrast , was on the defensive
in a spring 2016 piece about the same time he was allegedly meeting with papadopoulos he asserted that he knew russia quite well
online biographies present mifsud as an authority in the field of international relations and diplomacy across europe , the united states , russia , africa and the mediterranean region
but his academic work in these areas appears limited
he has published in peer-reviewed journals on maltese education policies
according to a biography on the london centre of international law practice 's website , which was deleted sunday , mifsud served prominently in malta 's ministry of foreign affairs and worked as an adviser for malta 's ministry of education
scotland 's university of stirling said in an emailed statement that mifsud joined its politics department in may this year as a full-time professorial teaching fellow
former colleagues said they did n't think of mifsud as someone with any particular russian expertise
nabil ayad , who hired mifsud as an honorary director at the london academy of diplomacy where ayad was founder and director said mifsud 's focus was broadly in the area of diplomacy
as assistant to the maltese foreign minister , he traveled to many countries and met many heads of state , ayad said
ayad said the institution 's work involved occasional trips to moscow , including for collaboration with the diplomatic academy of the russian foreign ministry
we tend to deal with governments , so i do n't think he has any special connections or relationships , ayad said
if a meeting took place between a russian official or he introduced someone , it must have been by chance , not by design
but mifsud had occasionally gone beyond the role of the typical academic
in 2015 , he was an observer for elections in kazakhstan that were sharply criticized by independent groups
mifsud 's take was far rosier , mirroring the russian line
the election , he told kazakh media , was consistent with all international norms
at many polling stations was an image that i associate with a family meeting , he reported
trump tries to diminish papadopoulos campaign role
we are academics , mifsud told the paper
we work closely with everybody
he said that he met papadopoulos in italy in march 2016 and then 10 days later in london
between 2013 and 2017 , mifsud visited moscow state university about once each year , giving lectures and posing for photographs with the department head , ilya ilyin
the nature of the partnership was not immediately clear , although mifsud had discussed exchange programs and joint research projects
reached on tuesday by telephone , alexeev played down the department 's ties to mifsud
i think he is one of those people who has a lot of connections , he said
