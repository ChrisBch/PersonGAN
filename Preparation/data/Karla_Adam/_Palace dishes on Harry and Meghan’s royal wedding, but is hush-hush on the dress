london the royal spokesman for kensington palace briefed the world media friday about the upcoming wedding of prince harry and american tv actress meghan markle
to say there is global interest in the cake , hairdresser , guest list , florist , receptions , carriage , honeymoon and , oh my gosh , the dress does not begin to describe the scene
more than 5,000 members of the media have been accredited
the briefings there were two , to accommodate both british and foreign journalists were held in the redgrave room of the queens gallery at buckingham palace
we sat on red chairs
water was served
the first reveals
despite tabloid rumors to the contrary , markles father will walk her down the aisle when she marries harry on may 19
markles mother will accompany her daughter by car to the front door of st. georges chapel at windsor castle
so far , good vibes
the actresss mother , doria ragland , and father , thomas markle , divorced when meghan was 6 years old
will meghans siblings and half-siblings come
( there has been a bit of bother about that in the british tabloids feelings of estrangement , it seems )
no comment on this topic from the kensington palace spokesman , who by tradition is usually not identified
will the newest addition to the royal family be at the wedding
alas , little louis will not be present
sorry , no , the spokesman said
the reporters groaned
the spokesman felt it necessary to explain , hes very young.
( he was born almost two weeks ago )
harry will arrive with his brother , who will be his best man ( but we already knew this )
a few surprises
also in a traditional royal wedding , which this one certainly will be , all of the bridesmaids and pageboys are children
the media wanted to know so , will prince george or princess charlotte , the elder progeny of william and catherine , serve as a pageboy and a bridesmaid
the spokesman said this will be revealed anon
harrys wedding naturally raises questions about his mother , who died in 1997 in a high-speed car crash in a paris tunnel while she was being pursued by paparazzi on motorbikes
the couple have said they want to celebrate the memory of princess diana at the wedding
all three of dianas siblings are invited , and jane fellowes , one of dianas two older sisters , will give a reading
the royal spokesman said
markle is to spend the night before the wedding in undisclosed lodgings at windsor castle , site of the wedding , which is about an hours drive west of central london
of course , the trip wont be so quick on the day of the wedding
the authorities expect large crowds , with road closures , packed trains and added security
at the briefing , there were lots of details about logistics
this promises to be an intensely covered global event
thousands of reporters are expected to be there , alongside 79 international broadcasters and 46 u.s. television affiliates
many details will not be announced until the days before or even the day of the wedding
the royals are a vital brand , and their pr professionals are astute players who know how to keep interest alive
for example , the palace is attempting to keep secret details about the dress , its manufacturer and designer
the spokesman said all will be revealed when markle steps out of her car at st. georges chapel
the service will last an hour , beginning at noon
there will be 1,200 guests on the windsor castle grounds representing charitable groups and inspiring locals , whom harry and markle wanted to highlight
there was a whiff of scandal when the guardian reported that these guests whom critics have described as living props or extras on an elaborate set would not be fed but rather encouraged to bring their own picnics
the palace said friday that refreshments will be served , though it provided no details
inside the chapel will be 600 guests
they will attend the service and the reception that follows
a smaller , more private reception is to take place saturday evening
there will be no official guest list , as the invited do not include heads of state
even british prime minister theresa may did not make the cut
guests were invited because they have a direct relationship with the couple.
all this flowers , cake , receptions , carriages will be paid for by the royal family
british taxpayers are shouldering the costs of security
tourists will contribute much
harry and meghan will quickly get to work being a royal married couple , with their first public appearance scheduled just a few days after the nuptials
they will leave for their honeymoon the following week
a mystery , people
we wont ever comment , the royal spokesman said
though one imagines that news will leak , as it almost always does
