london a government-ordered public inquiry into the london fire that killed at least 80 people formally opened thursday with the head of the investigation vowing to find answers to how a tragedy of such magnitude could occur
the public inquiry can and will provide answers to the pressing questions of how a disaster of this kind could occur in 21st-century london , said martin moore-bick , a retired judge who is heading the investigation
on june 14 a fire that started in the kitchen of an apartment spread rapidly through grenfell tower , a 24-story high-rise in one of london 's richest boroughs
it was the country 's deadliest fire in over a century
it also focused attention on inequality in london
the area around grenfell tower is one of the poorest in the country , yet a short stroll away is notting hill , one of the city 's poshest neighborhoods
the residents of the high-rise , many of whom are low-income immigrants , had previously raised concerns about fire-safety issues in the tower
thursday 's inquiry began with a minute 's silence in memory of those who died
police say at least 80 people died in the inferno , though some residents believe the real figure is higher
many of those who lost their homes are still waiting for a new one
about 150 families who lost their homes as a result of the fire are still living in hotels throughout london
only two families have moved into permanent housing
the venue for thursday 's opening session a luxury hotel in central london was chosen , moore-bick said , because it was big enough to accommodate the 300 people in attendance
but it was deemed inappropriate by some of the people who were there , including the member of parliament for kensington , labour 's emma dent coad
speaking to reporters outside the hotel , she said that sitting in a ballroom dripping with chandeliers says it all , actually that we are from a different world and we are going to do this for you little people
the inquiry will be divided into two phases the first will assess the cause of the fire and why it spread so rapidly
the second phase will examine the design of the building and the response to the disaster
moore-bick said there was a sense of urgency to complete the first phase , because if there are similar defects in other high-rise buildings , steps must be taken quickly to ensure those who live in them are kept safe
he also rejected an appeal for a grenfell resident to join his investigating team , saying that it would compromise the inquiry 's impartiality
at the end of his 45-minute statement , the retired judge stood up and walked out of the room
he did not respond when a lawyer representing some of the victims asked a question
david lammy , a labour lawmaker who lost a friend in the fire , said that moore-bick has to gain the trust of the local community if it is to have confidence in the inquiry 's conclusions and recommendations
he 's got off to a bumpy start with victims and families , lammy told the bbc
on thursday evening , hundreds gathered for a silent march on the streets surrounding grenfell , now a charred ruin
zeyad cred , one of the organizers , said that locals did n't have much faith in the inquiry
if i had faith in the system and the system worked , we would n't be in this situation in the first place , he said moments after hugging a woman who lost her sister and nephew in the fire
the judge read a set piece , left the room and did n't take questions - it left us feeling so despondent , said a woman at the march who declined to give her name
her brother died in the fire , she said , adding that she was talking to him on the phone when he was trapped inside until his phone went dead
moore-bick said that he aimed to begin the first public evidence hearings by the end of the year
investigators hope to publish their first report by easter 2018 , he said
in his opening statement , moore-bick paid tribute to the fortitude and resilience of the local community , noting that some schoolchildren who lived in grenfell escaped the inferno and took exams only hours later
ines alves , a 16-year-old student , fled the burning tower in the middle of the night , clutching her chemistry notes and cellphone
the following morning she showed up at school still wearing the same clothes she escaped the building in and took her chemistry exam
last month she found out she got an a on the test
