london it is a spy drama and it is real
an aging russian double agent is found slumped beside his daughter on a park bench in a quiet english town , both near death , apparently poisoned
now scotland yard is on the case
britains counterterrorism police on tuesday took over the investigation into what caused a balding former soviet-era spy , 66-year-old sergei skripal , to collapse sunday , leaving him staring into space , beside his comatose daughter , 33-year-old yulia
the pair remain in critical condition in a salisbury hospital
british foreign secretary boris johnson cautioned tuesday it would be wrong to prejudge the fast-moving investigation but warned that if russia were found responsible , the british government would respond robustly.
johnson told parliament that russia was now a malign and disruptive force.
the circumstances two people , both in critical condition just minutes after they appear healthy and ambling past a security camera immediately rang red bells in security circles
the ex-spy skripal was , according to neighbors , living a quiet life in salisbury
he was a man with a past
he had enemies
skripal was jailed in russia in 2006 after he was convicted of passing the names of russian intelligence agents working undercover in europe to mi6 , britains foreign intelligence service
in 2010 , he was handed over to britain as one of four prisoners released by moscow in exchange for 10 russian sleeper agents living in the united states
the high-profile spy swap took place on an airport tarmac in vienna like something out of a cold war john le carr novel
the strange doings in salisbury also immediately called to mind the 2006 poisoning of alexander litvinenko , who died in a london hospital bed three weeks after drinking tea laced with a rare radioactive substance
in 2016 , a 300-page british government inquiry found that russian president vladimir putin had probably approved the killing of litvinenko , who was an outspoken critic of the kremlin and a former kgb operative
in a statement tuesday , wiltshire police said skripal and his daughter were in intensive care , being treated for suspected exposure to an unknown substance.
the police added that a first responder who helped with the incident also remained in the hospital
authorities were sweeping nearby sites a restaurant and a pub for forensic evidence
said mark rowley , head of counterterrorism policing in the united kingdom
the russian presidents spokesman , dmitry peskov , told reporters tuesday that the kremlin knew nothing at all about the case and was ready to cooperate in the investigation if asked
he described any accusations against russia as predictable and not long in coming.
rowley , the counterterrorism chief , said no one was rushing to judgment russians living in england die all the time of natural causes but the special circumstances raised troubling questions
putin supporters said the skripal affair was an attempt to stir anti-russian sentiment ahead of a march 18 presidential election in russia
two russians whom britain accused of being behind the 2006 litvinenko murder were never charged instead , they have thrived
andrey lugovoy and dmitry kovtun both deny involvement in litvinenkos killing
kovtun , a businessman , predicted that british authorities would pursue an anti-russian scenario , as he claims they did in investigating litvinenkos death
kovtun told the interfax news agency
litvinenkos widow , marina litvinenko , said in an interview that seeing television footage of investigators wearing hazardous materials suits brought back painful memories
she praised the police for launching an investigation immediately they waited 2 weeks in her case , she said but she suggested that if this is shown to be an assassination attempt by russia , it would point to enduring vulnerabilities
eyal said the litvinenko case strained relations , as did more recent charges that russian state-sponsored trolls interfered in british politics
skripal kept a low profile in britain until sunday afternoon , when a member of the public called the police , concerned about the welfare of two people on a bench
eyewitnesses who saw the pair said they did not look well
