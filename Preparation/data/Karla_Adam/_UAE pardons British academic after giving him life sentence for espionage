london a british academic who had been sentenced to life in prison in the united arab emirates on spying charges received a presidential pardon and was released on monday
before announcing the pardon , the uae defended its assertion that matthew hedges , 31 , a doctoral student at durham university , was spying on behalf of the british government
uae officials played for journalists , but did not broadcast , video clips of what they characterized as a confession by hedges , in which he reportedly said he was a captain with mi6 , britains foreign intelligence agency

british foreign secretary jeremy hunt welcomed news of the pardon but said britain never supported the accusations
hedges was arrested may 5 at dubais airport as he was leaving the country after a two-week trip that his university and family say was to research emirati security and foreign policy for his phd thesis
after a judge in abu dhabi pronounced the life sentence last week , hunt warned about repercussions to the relationship with britain
the pardon was issued with immediate effect
hedges was released from detention and headed to the british embassy in the uae , in advance of flying back to london , according to his family
uae officials said the pardon came in response to a letter from hedgess family to uae president khalifa bin zayed al-nahyan asking for clemency
he was one of 785 people pardoned ahead of the countrys national day
