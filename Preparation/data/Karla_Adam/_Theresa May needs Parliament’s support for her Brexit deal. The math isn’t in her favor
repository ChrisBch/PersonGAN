london securing the unanimous approval of 27 european heads of state for a brexit deal was the easy part
on monday , british prime minister theresa may turned to a far greater challenge winning support from skeptical british lawmakers and their constituents
a vote on the deal in parliament is scheduled for dec. 11 , with the hope that britain can leave the european union in a smooth and orderly way in march
but the math doesnt appear to be on mays side
she needs 318 votes in the house of commons for the deal to pass
by many estimates , shes more than 60 votes short
the chances are currently around zero , to put it bluntly , said jonathan tonge , a politics professor at the university of liverpool
he said passage would require the biggest whipping operation youve ever seen in the conservative party.
and even if the resistance within mays own party melts away , she would need support from some opposition lawmakers
northern irelands democratic unionist party , which props up mays minority government , is against the deal
may is planning to make her case in an election-style campaign through england , northern ireland , scotland and wales over the next two weeks
she previewed her stump speech in parliament on monday
may said the brexit withdrawal agreement , painstakingly negotiated over more than 17 months , was a good deal and , crucially , it was the only one on the table
there is not a better deal available , she told lawmakers , adding that e.u
leaders have also stressed the point
scores of lawmakers stood to denounce the plan
he cited one estimate that the british economy would shrink by 3.9 percent with the current deal in place
plowing on is not stoic , corbyn added.
its an act of national self-harm.
boris johnson , a conservative member of parliament and leading brexiteer who resigned as mays foreign secretary in july , said that to call mays plan unsatisfactory would be an understatement
mays half-in , half-out compromise divorce deal has angered leavers and remainers alike
brexiteers want a clean break from the european union , and pro-europeans think the deal is worse than the status quo
in an intervention that didnt do may any favors , president trump told reporters monday that her brexit deal sounds like a great deal for the e.u.
he also said that it could hinder a trade deal between the united states and britain
said trump , who has previously said brexit is a fantastic thing.
the statement added
if parliament votes down this version of brexit , britain faces the possibility of leaving the european union in march with no deal in place , a doomsday scenario that could result in grounded airplanes , medicine shortages and economic havoc
most political analysts predict that such a fate would be avoided
if mays deal is struck down , and if market chaos ensues , lawmakers might be willing to vote for it in a second go-round
analysts draw parallels with the troubled asset relief program , or tarp
the u.s. congress initially rejected a bank bailout plan in 2008 but later passed it with a few amendments after markets panicked
mujtaba rahman , an analyst with eurasia group , said that what happens next would depend on the size of mays defeat
in a briefing note , he predicted that if she loses the dec. 11 vote by a small margin , she will seek changes from the e.u
and aim for a second parliamentary vote , likely in january
but a heavy defeat would increase the odds of other outcomes
britain might work with the e.u
on a managed no-deal scenario or get european approval to extend the brexit deadline beyond march
some lawmakers are discussing a norway plus option that would see britain join the four-nation european free trade association
a second brexit referendum in britain or a general election would also be possible
tonge said that if the proposal doesnt get the support of parliament , mays credibility will be in tatters because she is so wedded to the deal.
but may has proved time and again that she has staying power
she survived an attempted coup last week by euroskeptics who failed , at least for the moment , to get enough lawmakers to launch a vote of no confidence against her
when asked in a recent radio phone-in whether she would resign if her deal wasnt passed , may dodged the question
