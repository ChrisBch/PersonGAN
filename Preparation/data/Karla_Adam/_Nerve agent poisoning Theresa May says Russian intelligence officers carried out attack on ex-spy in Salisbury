london british authorities on wednesday named two russian suspects wanted for a brazen attack with the nerve agent novichok on a former russian spy and his daughter in the english city of salisbury
for the first time , prime minister theresa may said the suspects were both russian military intelligence officers who had traveled from moscow to london , using russian passports with false names
british authorities posted on wednesday detailed surveillance camera images and other information tracking the two men moving through busy gatwick airport , crowded london train and subway stations and the streets of salisbury all while allegedly carrying the military-grade poison
what is novichok , the nerve agent identified in the salisbury spy attack
russian officials on wednesday denied any responsibility and repeated assertions that the british were putting out false claims and refusing to let russia see evidence
we believe this is a provocation , alexander shulgin , russias permanent representative to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons , told state television wednesday
britain will present its evidence that russia was behind the attack at a u.n. security council meeting thursday
british police say the skripals were poisoned in march at the front door of their home in salisbury , a quiet tourist town in the southern english countryside near the ruins of stonehenge
the elder skripal had been a russian military intelligence officer who later switched sides and acted as a double agent serving the british
he was arrested in moscow in late 2004 and convicted in 2006 , then released to britain in a 2010 spy exchange
both he and his daughter survived the poisoning and are living in an undisclosed location
the police officer recovered , as well
but 44-year-old british national dawn sturgess , a mother of three , died in july from exposure to what police say was the same nerve agent that afflicted the skripals , in a town just north of salisbury
her british boyfriend , charlie rowley , had given her what appeared to be a bottle of perfume that hed found in a charity bin
rowley was sickened but subsequently recovered

police on wednesday released images of the bottle a counterfeit nina ricci dispenser with a modified nozzle that they say had contained novichok
they also released a chilling timeline of the movements of the two suspects
neil basu , scotland yards counterterrorism chief , said the men arrived at londons gatwick airport on march 2 and stayed at a hotel in east london , where traces of novichok were later found
on march 3 , the men went to salisbury for reconnaissance.
they returned the following day , and thats when we believe they contaminated the front door with novichok , basu said
the two alleged assailants traveled via some of the busiest train and subway stations in london , including victoria and waterloo
on march 4 , the pair boarded an aeroflot plane at londons heathrow airport and returned to moscow
basu said , adding that public health officials do not think there is any risk to people who were on the same flights or trains as the two suspects
that same day , march 4 , the skripals were found slumped on a park bench in salisbury
yulia skripal was unconscious
sergei skripal appeared to be hallucinating
first responders initially thought it was a drug overdose , but at the hospital , doctors suspected poisoning
britains military research laboratory confirmed that the poison was a soviet-era nerve agent
british police described their investigation as massive
basu said wednesday
more than 250 detectives , alongside dozens of forensic scientists and health investigators , have been working the case
the team took 1,400 statements and reviewed 11,000 hours of video surveillance footage recorded on britains extensive closed-circuit television camera systems
there has been intense international interest in the case and wide condemnation that russia not only continued to manufacture and hoard novichok but would deploy an outlawed nerve agent on foreign soil
in response , the trump administration , alongside britain and european countries , expelled hundreds of russian diplomats suspected of being spies
