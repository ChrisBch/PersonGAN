london president trump 's cancellation of a possible trip to the british capital next month inspired glee and concern friday , while raising new questions about the strained relations between london and washington
many londoners suggested the real reason he is not coming is because he is concerned about hostile demonstrations
sadiq khan , the mayor of london , said a visit would spark mass peaceful protests
trump is not welcome in london while he pursues a divisive agenda , khan tweeted , and it seems he 's finally got that message
but at least one prominent british cabinet official took no part in the gloating
foreign secretary boris johnson , a former mayor of london , accused khan and labour party leader jeremy corbyn of endangering the crucial relationship between the united states and britain
he also called khan a puffed up pompous popinjay
the white house had not formally announced the visit trump said he had canceled , but the president was widely expected to attend a ceremony next month to dedicate the new embassy
robert woody johnson , the u.s. ambassador to britain and a friend of trump 's , told the bbc last month he was optimistic about a visit in the new year
as usual , hes dead wrong former u.s. ambassadors explain london embassy move after trump criticism
unlike other european leaders , british prime minister theresa may initially went out of her way to extend a hand of friendship to the new trump administration
she offered the president a full state visit just a week after his inauguration , prompting speculation that she was hoping to secure a good trade deal post-brexit
but things have since grown strained
robin niblett , the director of chatham house , a london think tank , said that u.s.-british relations are buffeted by trump 's moods
he noted that on some matters , such as the day-to-day business of security cooperation between the two countries , the relationship is good but that on big foreign policy issues such as the paris climate agreement or the iran nuclear deal it is tense
a personal relationship between trump and may should be there to cover some of those differences in strategic approach , but it just ca n't , he said , adding that trump is constantly looking for new excuses not to come
some foreign policy analysts in washington suggested trump and may could meet this year on the sidelines of summits in other countries , and one suggested trump could visit a smaller city in britain , perhaps one that included one of his golf resorts
it is extraordinary that the president of the united states can not visit britain over the fear of mass protests , said thomas wright , director of the center on the united states and europe at the brookings institution in washington
that 's unprecedented
julie smith , a senior fellow at the center for a new american security who served as deputy national security adviser for vice president joe biden , called it a sorry state of play
it says a lot about where our relationship is with the u.k. and how thin-skinned our president is , she said
smith scoffed at the idea that trump was worried about the cost and location of the embassy , noting that the move has been in the works for years
the old embassy is in elegant mayfair , an area dotted with foreign embassies and close to west end department stores
the area is full of residential buildings , and neighbors were apt to complain about the threat to their homes
robert h. tuttle , who served as u.s. ambassador to britain from 2005 to 2009 , said he knew early on that the mission would need to move
there were two narrow side streets by the embassy , he said in an interview
johnson , the current ambassador , agreed that security concerns after sept. 11 , 2001 , necessitated the move
the new , bigger embassy is in nine elms , a former industrial area in battersea , south of the river thames
it 's as close to westminster as the old embassy
the new u.s. embassy in london a crystalline sugar cube worth a billion dollars
wanted me to cut ribbon no
in fact , it was the george w. bush administration that decided more than a decade ago to relocate the embassy during a worldwide push to improve security at u.s. diplomatic sites
trump is a highly controversial figure in britain , where he recently succeeded in uniting politicians across the political aisle when he retweeted a far-right group 's anti-muslim videos
there is reason to believe that a visit by the president also would be met by loud opposition in the streets
shortly after trump 's inauguration , tens of thousands of demonstrators turned out in london for a women 's march in solidarity with anti-trump rallies worldwide
a group called stop trump vowed the biggest demonstration in british history , should trump visit
on a facebook event page , more than 8,000 registered to attend a rally for a protest event that is n't even scheduled
a wax figure of the u.s. president did not get the memo about the canceled visit and on friday made a brief appearance outside the new u.s. embassy
trump 's visit there was expected to be a scaled-down working trip that would include a ribbon-cutting ceremony
british media outlets reported that secretary of state rex tillerson will now do the honors
two white house officials did not respond to requests for comment friday
asked about trump calling off his embassy visit , a downing street spokesman reiterated that a full state visit , where the queen acts as official host , has been accepted and stands
despite being offered nearly a year ago , that visit has yet to be scheduled
meanwhile , twitter users seized the moment
the site was abuzz with people sharing fanciful reasons for canceling a trip to london using the hashtag icancelledmytriptolondon
one user wrote icancelledmytriptolondon because hadrian has n't finished building that wall
