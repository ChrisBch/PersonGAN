london yulia skripal , who was poisoned in a nerve agent attack alongside her father , a former russian double agent , was discharged late monday from a hospital and taken to a secure location , her doctors said tuesday
a salisbury police officer who was a first responder at the park bench where the two skripals were found was also treated at a hospital and released last month
sergei skripal remains in the hospital , but his doctors say his condition is improving rapidly.
how did ex-spy skripal and his daughter survive nerve-agent poisoning
skripal is thought to be under the protection of british security forces
the russian embassy said it would consider any secret resettlement of sergei and yulia skripal an abduction of the two russian nationals or a forced isolation.
british investigators and prime minister theresa may say the skripals were poisoned by a novichok-class military-grade nerve agent of the type developed by the soviet union and russia
may said tuesday that she wishes the younger skripal the best for her continuing recovery.
russian officials have denied wrongdoing in the case
top russian diplomats have charged that the attack could have been carried out by british agents , in an attempt to smear russia , increase military budgets or distract their own people from difficult brexit negotiations
after the attacks , 28 countries , including the united states , booted more than 150 russian diplomats many suspected of being intelligence agents from their embassies
russia responded with a similar number of expulsions
