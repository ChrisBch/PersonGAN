london britain 's defense secretary michael fallon abruptly resigned wednesday following allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior
earlier this week , the sun tabloid newspaper ran a front-page story about fallon or sir michael as he is known now after he was knighted in 2015 repeatedly putting his hand on a well-known radio journalist 's knee at a dinner in 2002
the journalist , julia hartley-brewer , dismissed the incident as mildly amusing , and said , no one was remotely upset or distressed
but british media reported that there may be similar incidents that have occurred more recently
in his letter of resignation , fallon wrote , a number of allegations have surfaced about mps in recent days , including some about my previous conduct
many of these have been false but i accept in the past i have fallen below the high standards that we require of the armed forces that i have the honour to represent
he concluded , i have reflected on my position and i am now resigning as defense secretary
fallon is a well-regarded defense secretary , with decades of service in a series of top government posts
he was initially opposed to britain leaving the european union , fearing that it would strengthen russia 's hand on the continent
responding to the resignation , british prime minister theresa may said i appreciate the characteristically serious manner in which you have considered your position , and the particular example you wish to set to servicemen and women and others
read the resignation letter from fallon and mays response
may did not mention the allegations of sexual misconduct in her letter
instead , she thanked fallon for his service in four departments of state under four prime ministers and wished him well in continuing to serve in parliament
before fallon 's resignation , hartley-brewer recalled the incident in a statement
i calmly and politely explained to him that if he did it again i would 'punch him in the face
he withdrew his hand and that was the end of the matter
after fallon apologized , hartley-brewer tweeted that no one was remotely upset or distressed by it
my knees remain intact
hartley-brewer told sky news on wednesday evening that she did n't think the resignation was due to knee-gate alone
i 'm assuming that there are more allegations to come whether in a tabloid newspaper tomorrow or sooner than that , the journalist said
i doubt very much it was a result of my knee -- and if it is , then i think that 's really mad and absurd and crazy
