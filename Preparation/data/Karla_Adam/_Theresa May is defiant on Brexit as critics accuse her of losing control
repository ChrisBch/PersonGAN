london amid growing anger over her leadership , prime minister theresa may struck a defiant tone monday , insisting that brexit negotiations are 95 percent done and that the final product will amount to a good deal for britain
may has faced harsh criticism from brexit hard-liners , who say she is ceding control to the european union from political rivals , who say she has lost command over her party and from those who want to remain in the e.u
and say she is denying the people of britain control over their future
may told parliament , adding that her government has been making progress in talks with negotiators across the english channel
but that last 5 percent is no small thing
indeed , how to avoid a hard border between northern ireland , which is part of the united kingdom , and ireland , an e.u
member , is a real sticking point , may acknowledged
it has been this way for months
british farmers worry who will pick the fruit after brexit
the problem is becoming more urgent , however , because britain is set to leave the e.u
in just five months
if the two sides do not strike a divorce deal , britain risks exiting without one a doomsday scenario that could have serious implications for the economy and daily life
two years after britons voted 52 percent to 48 percent in favor of leaving the e.u. , brexit continues to be a highly divisive issue
on saturday , thousands of people took to the streets to protest brexit and call for a peoples vote.
organizers estimated that 700,000 people turned out , which would make it the largest protest in britain since the start of the iraq war
still , it was noteworthy that none of the featured speakers were leading members of the ruling conservative or opposition labour party
may further angered her critics in recent days when she indicated she would be open to extending the brexit transition period beyond the proposed timeline of december 2020
that is deeply unpopular with the hard-liners , who say it would leave britain in the position of a vassal state , and with those desperate to end the uncertainty associated with brexit
jeremy corbyn , leader of the labour party , said in parliament on monday
meanwhile , may also must contend with allegations of plots against her
in the weekend british papers , unnamed lawmakers were quoted using savage imagery to describe a possible coup , with some saying that assassination is in the air and that may should bring her own noose to an upcoming meeting
but the remarks may have backfired
their tone if not the substance was condemned by politicians from all parties
many of those who took exception to the remarks referenced jo cox , the labour member of parliament who was killed in 2016 by a right-wing extremist
there were also calls to unmask the lawmakers who made the purported comments
most analysts say it is unlikely that may will be ousted just yet
forty-eight conservative lawmakers have to submit the letters required to trigger a vote of no confidence , but many predict that in the current climate at least may would probably win that vote
and despite all the mudslinging from the sidelines , there is not an obvious successor
boris johnson , the former foreign secretary , may be hugely popular among the conservative grass roots , but many doubt that his preferred brexit deal would win the support of parliament
said jonathan tonge , a professor of politics at the university of liverpool
