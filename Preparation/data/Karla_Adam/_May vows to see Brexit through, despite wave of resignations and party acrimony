it was one of the most tumultuous days in recent british politics
suddenly , everything hung in the balance
not only was mays future as leader unsure , but so too was the momentous decision to split from the continental bloc
some members of parliament pleaded with may to stage a second peoples vote to give citizens a chance to rethink brexit
others decried her proposals as condemning britain to years of unbreakable alliance with european rules and regulations and failing to make good on the vow to take back control as the pro-brexit campaign promised two years ago
at risk is the possibility that if a deal isnt finalized by the end of the year , britain could crash out of the european union in march with chaotic uncertainty that could devastate the british economy
the day began with abandonment , as dominic raab abruptly resigned as brexit secretary , saying he could not support the withdrawal agreement that he had helped negotiate and that mays cabinet had approved the night before
this was an especially stinging setback for may
raab was her second brexit secretary to quit
following him out the door thursday was another cabinet secretary , two junior ministers and three other conservative lawmakers in government
may held fast to her script , saying she believes with every fiber of my being that her brexit is the right one
but even as she spoke , a leadership contest loomed
to trigger a vote of no confidence against may , 48 conservative lawmakers would have to submit letters calling for such a ballot
by evening , there was no announcement of that threshold being reached
am i going to see this through
yes , may said at the news conference
public confidence in brexit , too , has been wavering
although britain voted to leave the e.u
by 52 percent to 48 percent in june 2016 , the latest polls show slightly more voters would prefer to remain
surveys indicate that people are frustrated with how brexit is being handled but still prefer mays leadership over anyone elses
the prime minister said thursday that the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with e.u
officials would get a vote from the leaders of the remaining 27 e.u
states in brussels on nov. 25
approval in brussels is nearly assured
far more challenging will be getting the deal through parliament
british lawmakers are supposed to get their say in early december
may on thursday predicted that the withdrawal agreement would pass but acknowledged the deal was weighed down by compromise
such optimism was not visible in the chamber
hardly anyone stood to support may , as the pound sterling plummeted on currency markets and the hashtag brexitshambles was trending
as will major parties from northern ireland and scotland
its dead on arrival.
he was referring to the deals backstop to prevent the reemergence of a hard border and political tensions on the island of ireland
that insurance plan would keep northern ireland and , to a lesser degree great britain , in a european customs union if britain and the e.u
fail to sign a future free-trade deal that preserves open borders in ireland
the rapid-fire resignations sent shudders through e.u
headquarters in brussels , raising the possibility that may does not have the support she needs to pursue the softer brexit she negotiated
tweeted marietje schaake , a dutch member of the european parliament
said michel barnier , the e.u.s chief negotiator
may , though , was still talking in terms of a win
at the end of her news conference , one reporter asked about the prospects of her brexit effort by using an extended metaphor about the game of cricket
