not so very long ago , this wedding with this service , and this officiant , at this place would have been impossible
not because markle is an american and a commoner , marrying a prince now sixth in line for the throne
and not because the actress is biracial , was raised episcopalian and attended catholic school in los angeles
no , such a service would have been opposed by the church of england hierarchy because markle is divorced and her former husband , hollywood producer trevor engelson , is still alive
that would have been a no-no , said andrew goddard , an anglican priest at st. james the less in london and an authority on the history of christian attitudes toward marriage
even though the anglican church was founded by a king wanting to rid himself of his queen , the british royal family and the religion it heads have been struggling with divorce and remarriage for centuries
goddard said , adding that there are still traditionalists in the church of england who believe that marriage means forever , full stop
harry and markles ceremony on saturday will be the first full-blown royal wedding of a divorced partner to take place with the loving embrace of the fusty english church
said the most reverend justin welby
the daily mails chief royal correspondent broke the news that welby baptized markle using holy water from the river jordan in a secret ceremony in march at the chapel royal , with harry by her side
a quiet confirmation followed which allows markle to take communion
this is a historic moment for a bedrock british institution
church and crown , at various points , have resisted its arrival
but the house of windsor has also generated a centurys worth of headlines and teachable moments about adultery , separation , divorce and remarriage
embarrassing as their scandals have been , the royal familys lapses have mirrored those in greater british society , and some say helped the church leadership to modernize
americans tend to forget the british less so that queen elizabeth ii is not only the sovereign but also the supreme governor of an official state religion , the church of england
( anglicans are protestants who are affiliated with the british empire , including those who go by other names in other parts of the world , such as episcopalians in the united states )
her role may be mostly ceremonial , but its far from meaningless
the queen still approves the appointment of each bishop in her church
shes not divine , shes not a british pope , but elizabeths many titles include defender of the faith , passed down to her from henry viii
henry , you may recall , had six wives
as the ditty goes one died , one survived , two de-wedded , two beheaded
when he broke with the pope and declared himself head of a new church in 1533 , it was because he wanted to annul his first marriage to catherine of aragon , who had failed to produce a male heir
( henrys remains rest in st. georges chapel , right below harry and meghans feet , alongside jane seymour , the only one to give him a legitimate son )
what was permitted for henry , however , wasnt okay for just anyone , including or especially other royals
oliver odonovan , a scholar-priest who taught at oxford and edinburgh , offered coffee and biscuits and an hours tutorial on divorce in the den of his home in scotland
odonovan explained that the church of england was very much opposed to divorce from the medieval age to the 19th century
asked what british marrieds with irreconcilable differences did back in the day , odonovan raised an eyebrow and said , i should think of mistresses and poison.
couples wishing to formally divorce needed an act of parliament
this was a rich mans game
even after divorce became legal , remarriage remained a thorny question
in 1936 , edward viii , a popular royal and notorious playboy , abdicated the throne when his proposed marriage to wallis simpson , a twice-divorced american , could not be reconciled with his role as head of the church of england
edwards brother george vi ascended , to be followed by georges daughter elizabeth
the queen is a devout christian
shes also a model of matrimonial endurance , married for 70 years
and she tried mightily to avoid echoes of her uncles scandal
in 1953 , not wanting to be seen as condoning divorce , she withheld her approval of the hoped-for union between her sister , princess margaret , and the divorced capt
elizabeth later worked out a deal whereby margaret could relinquish her place in the line of succession to the throne , thus avoiding the need for the queen to sign off
the church of england would not officiate margaret would marry at a government registers office in london
in the end , margaret let townsend go ( though she did wed and subsequently divorce , too )
the exceptional is now routine
britains divorce rates are about the same as in europe and the united states
the office of national statistics says 4 in 10 marriages in england and wales end in divorce , although the rate is down from its peak in 1992
( thats mostly because there are more singles and more couples living together without being married )
three of queen elizabeths four children have divorced princess anne in 1992
prince andrew in may 1996 ( though he and sarah ferguson are rumored to remain very close )
and later that year , after a string of infidelities , tabloid exposs , leaked tapes , tell-all biographies and separation , prince charles and princess diana finally divorced , with the queens blessing ( or , according to dianas allies , insistence )
anne and charles have remarried but not in the style that will be afforded to harry and meghan
in 1992 , anne wed her second husband , british naval commander timothy j.h
laurence , in a private service before 30 guests at crathie church near the royal balmoral castle in scotland
notably , elizabeth is not head of the scots church
in 2005 , charles married his longtime love , camilla parker bowles , also divorced
they took their vows in a civil service and afterward received a blessing by an archbishop
robert lacey , a royal biographer , said divorce today is not the crisis it once was , even for the totemic , idealized royal family who in the past was expected to be the last to surrender.
and supreme governor of the church of england
mark burkill , vicar at christ church in leyton and a leader of an evangelical movement within the church of england , is among the holdouts
instead , he offers a service of blessing on a marriage after a civil ceremony
prince harry and meghan markle are among those who have been cohabiting in their case , in nottingham cottage on the grounds of kensington palace
the archbishop of canterbury said he has been counseling and praying with the couplethe couple , and all requirements have been met to launch this marriage
