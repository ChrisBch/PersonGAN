london with less than a year to go before britain leaves the european union a decision voters made in part to stem immigration the government is confronting a scandal over its treatment of migrants , both legal and illegal
late sunday , amber rudd resigned as britains home secretary following accusations that she lied to parliament last week about deportation targets for illegal immigrants
rudd first told parliament that there were no national quotas , then amended her remarks and said that maybe there were some
finally , the guardian produced a private letter rudd sent to may outlining her commitment to increase deportations by 10 percent , which included numbers and targets
on monday , her replacement was named sajid javid , a successful investor , experienced government minister and the first member of an ethnic minority to hold the position of home secretary
javid is the son of a pakistani immigrant bus driver and is one of the most outspoken members of mays cabinet to confront president trump over his tweets about muslims
but the departure of rudd the fourth member of mays top leadership team to resign in the past six months and the appointment of javid have not subdued the scandal
the prime ministers critics note that it was may not rudd who as home secretary was responsible for the changes in immigration rules that led to doctors , landlords and employers checking peoples immigration statuses
postwar britain welcomed these workers
now they must prove they belong
britons , overall , probably would not be too upset with a government that pushed illegal immigrants out
but the windrush stories , first reported in the guardian , drew widespread condemnation
even mays own tories said the shabby treatment was an affront to british decency
may has repeatedly apologized in recent days for her governments treatment of people from the caribbean and other commonwealth citizens living in britain
but the opposition labour party has continued to train its fire on her
the timing is a huge headache for may , coming amid tricky brexit negotiations and just days ahead of local elections thursday , with polls suggesting that the conservative party could face big losses
the scandal also has raised eyebrows across the english channel , with european union officials worried about the post-brexit immigration status of the 3 million e.u
citizens who live in britain
brexiteers didnt shed tears over the departure of rudd , who was once considered a leading candidate for the conservative party leadership and was a prominent pro-e.u
voice during the june 2016 referendum over britains future in the bloc
may has tried to keep a delicate balance of remainers and leavers in her cabinet
javid was a remainer , but a tepid one , at least publicly
javid on monday said that his most urgent task is to help those unfairly caught up in the windrush fiasco
his parents moved to britain from pakistan in the 1960s , and he said the windrush crisis hit home for him
