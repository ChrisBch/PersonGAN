the remarks cast an immediate pall over a visit that included a lavish dinner with business leaders thursday night and plans to meet queen elizabeth ii for afternoon tea on friday
it was the latest international incident to erupt during trumps brief sojourn abroad , which kicked off with incendiary comments that upended a nato summit in brussels and further strained relationships with longtime u.s. allies
in addition to attacking may on brexit , trump also praised her archrival , boris johnson , as a potential future prime minister while attacking londons mayor as soft on crime and terrorism
the blunt language and harsh dismissal in trumps interview stunned 10 downing street
on its front page , the daily mail said trump had offered typically blunt home truths for britain.
if may has britain align its rules and regulations for goods and agricultural products with europe , following a common rule book with brussels , as may puts it , then , trump said , that could derail a trade deal with washington
trump told the sun , which published its splash at 11 p.m. in britain
trump was scheduled to meet with may for talks on friday
the u.s. contingent expected the story to post friday morning and was startled to leave the dinner thursday and see it online
sanders told the british government about the interview but thought it would be somewhat more positive , an official said
a second white house official said trump had two days of positive interactions with may
but the official also conceded that trump had talked about her vulnerabilities and criticized her political acumen privately for many months
the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations
trump also said to the sun that he was not spending much time in london on this trip because he did not feel welcome , due to mass demonstrations planned for friday
trump lashed out at london mayor sadiq khan , too , saying that hes done a bad job on tackling terrorism and crime
but he spoke glowingly of johnson , who quit the cabinet this week in protest over mays plans for a soft brexit
trump did not have public events in britain on thursday
planners have taken great care to keep him from protests
after his trips overseas to asia and the middle east , trump went on for days about the grandiose treatment and the brits were clearly trying to do well by him
according to an account provided by 10 downing street
an hour later , the interview with the sun appeared and seemed to dash mays hopes
brian klaas , a fellow in global politics at the london school of economics , said may is walking a tightrope
she needs trump to promise fantastic trade deals and help may deliver the global britain she has promised
but she cant appear fawning
robin niblett , director of chatham house , a london think tank , said that for may , the trump visit was something to be survived.
recalling the disaster that struck british leader tony blair , in his embrace of george w. bush and his alliance with washington in the iraq war , niblett said may would be extremely wary of being seen as trumps poodle.
organizers of britains nationwide protests are committed to staging some of the largest demonstrations since 2003 , when hundreds of thousands hit the streets to oppose war in iraq
organizers said that from the moment trump landed on british soil to the moment he leaves , he will be met by a carnival of resistance.
a giant trump baby balloon will fly over parliament square
protesters plan to shout at trump at places he will be visiting winfield house , blenheim palace , chequers , windsor castle and his trump turnberry golf resort in scotland
others will assemble in towns and cities up and down the country
said david lammy , a leading member in the opposition labour party
