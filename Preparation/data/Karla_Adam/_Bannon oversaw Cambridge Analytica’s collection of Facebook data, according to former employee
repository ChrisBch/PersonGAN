london conservative strategist stephen k. bannon oversaw cambridge analyticas early efforts to collect troves of facebook data as part of an ambitious program to build detailed profiles of millions of american voters , a former employee of the data-science firm said tuesday
among the messages tested were drain the swamp and deep state , he said
cambridge analytica , which worked for trumps 2016 campaign , is now facing questions about alleged unethical practices , including charges that the firm improperly handled the data of tens of millions of facebook users
on tuesday , the companys board announced that it was suspending its chief executive , alexander nix , after british television released secret recordings that appeared to show him talking about entrapping political opponents
more than three years before he served as trumps chief political strategist , bannon helped launch cambridge analytica with the financial backing of the wealthy mercer family as part of a broader effort to create a populist power base
earlier this year , the mercers cut ties with bannon after he was quoted making incendiary comments about trump and his family
bannon , who served on the companys board , did not respond to a request for comment
he served as vice president and secretary of cambridge analytica from june 2014 to august 2016 , when he became chief executive of trumps campaign , according to his publicly filed financial disclosure
in 2017 , he joined trump in the white house as his chief strategist
bannon received more than $ 125,000 in consulting fees from cambridge analytica in 2016 and owned membership units in the company worth between $ 1 million and $ 5 million , according to his financial disclosure
cambridge analytica did not respond to a request for comment about bannons role
cambridge analytica whistleblower to testify to house democrats on facebook data operation
it is unclear whether bannon knew how cambridge analytica was obtaining the data , which allegedly was collected through an app that was portrayed as a tool for psychological research but was then transferred to the company
facebook has said that information was improperly shared and that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015
cambridge analytica officials said that they had done so , but facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted
bannon approved the data-collection scheme we were proposing , wylie said
the mercers did not respond to a request for comment
he wasnt a client or anything.
the year before trump announced his presidential bid , the data firm already had found a high level of alienation among young , white americans with a conservative bent
the firm also tested views of russian president vladimir putin
the controversy over cambridge analyticas data collection erupted in recent days amid news reports that an app created by a cambridge university psychologist , aleksandr kogan , accessed extensive personal data of 50 million facebook users
the app , called thisisyourdigitallife , was downloaded by 270,000 users
facebooks policy , which has since changed , allowed kogan to also collect data including names , home towns , religious affiliations and likes on all of the facebook friends of those users
kogan shared that data with cambridge analytica for its growing database on american voters
facebook on friday banned the parent company of cambridge analytica , kogan and wylie for improperly sharing that data
the federal trade commission has opened an investigation into facebook to determine whether the social media platform violated a 2011 consent decree governing its privacy policies when it allowed the data collection
and wylie plans to testify to democrats on the house intelligence committee as part of their investigation of russian interference in the election , including possible ties to the trump campaign
meanwhile , britains channel 4 news aired a video tuesday in which nix was shown boasting about his work for trump
he seemed to highlight his firms secrecy , at one point stressing the need to set up a special email account that self-destructs all messages so that theres no evidence , theres no paper trail , theres nothing.
nix could not be reached for comment
cambridge analytica was set up as a u.s. affiliate of british-based scl group , which had a wide range of governmental clients globally , in addition to its political work
wylie said that bannon and nix first met in 2013 , the same year that wylie a young data whiz with some political experience in britain and canada was working for scl group
bannon and wylie met soon after and hit it off in conversations about culture , elections and how to spread ideas using technology
the mercers and stephen bannon how a populist power base was funded and built
robert mercer , in particular , seemed transfixed by the groups plans to harness and analyze data , he recalled
the mercers were keen to create a u.s.-based business to avoid bad optics and violating u.s. campaign finance rules , wylie said.
they wanted to create an american brand , he said
the young company struggled to quickly deliver on its promises , wiley said
widely available information from commercial data brokers provided peoples names , addresses , shopping habits and more , but failed to distinguish on more fine-grained matters of personality that might affect political views
cambridge analytica initially worked for 2016 republican candidate sen. ted cruz ( tex
) , who was backed by the mercers
the trump campaign had rejected early overtures to hire cambridge analytica , and trump himself said in may 2016 that he always felt that the use of voter data was overrated.
after cruz faded , the mercers switched their allegiance to trump and pitched their services to trumps digital director , brad parscale
the companys hiring was approved by trumps son-in-law , jared kushner , who was informally helping to manage the campaign with a focus on digital strategy
kushner said he built a data hub for the campaign which nobody knew about , until towards the end.
kushners spokesman and lawyer both declined to comment tuesday
the claim was widely questioned , and the trump campaign later said that it didnt rely on psychographic data from cambridge analytica
instead , the campaign said that it used a variety of other digital information to identify probable supporters
parscale said in a post interview in october 2016 that he had not opened the hood on cambridge analyticas methodology , and said he got much of his data from the republican national committee
parscale declined to comment tuesday
he has previously said that the trump campaign did not use any psychographic data from cambridge analytica
cambridge analyticas parent company , scl group , has an ongoing contract with the state departments global engagement center
the company was paid almost $ 500,000 to interview people overseas to understand the mind-set of islamist militants as part of an effort to counter their online propaganda and block recruits
heather nauert , the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy , said tuesday that the contract was signed in november 2016 , under the obama administration , and has not expired yet
in public records , the contract is dated in february 2017 , and the reason for the discrepancy was not clear
nauert said that the state department had signed other contracts with scl group in the past
