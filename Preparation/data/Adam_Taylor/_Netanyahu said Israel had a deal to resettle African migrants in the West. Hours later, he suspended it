<START> israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced monday he would scrap controversial plans to deport african asylum seekers , saying he had reached an unprecedented understanding with the united nations to help resettle many of those migrants in western countries
<START> many others would be allowed to remain in israel
<START> but just hours later , netanyahu hit the brakes writing on facebook that he would suspend the new plan until he had met with delegates from southern tel aviv , where many african asylum seekers now live
<START> the sudden shift reflects how nettlesome the issue of african migrants has become in israel , and netanyahu appeared hesitant to anger his core supporters , many of whom oppose letting large numbers of migrants in the country
<START> in the initial statement released by netanyahus office , israel said it was working with the united nations to resettle at least 16,250 migrants in western nations under the plan , which would be carried out in stages over five years
<START> netanyahu later said at a news conference that israel would offer temporary residency status to the same number of asylum seekers as were resettled in western nations
<START> about 38,000 sudanese and eritrean migrants live in israel
<START> most of them entered the country illegally via the land border with egypt before a border fence was completed in 2012
<START> the office of the u.n. high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) said a joint working group would come up with a plan for african migrants in israel
<START> under the agreement reached with israel , the agency said , it would work with other countries to facilitate the departure of asylum seekers from israel under various programs , including sponsorship , resettlement , family reunion and labor migration schemes
<START> said volker trk , the unhcr assistant high commissioner for protection , who signed the agreement on behalf of the united nations
<START> there still appeared to be major details to arrange
<START> netanyahu told reporters on monday that canada , italy and germany could be among the countries where migrants would be resettled
<START> q & a with israeli interior minister aryeh deri plan to deport thousands of africans is not about race
<START> many of the migrants have flocked in recent years to neighborhoods in southern tel aviv , rapidly changing the historically working-class areas into what has become known as little africa and sparking tension with the local jewish population
<START> israel had begun handing out notices to male african migrants in february , warning them they had two months to leave the country or face jail
<START> those migrants were offered $ 3,500 to relocate to an unnamed third country widely reported to be uganda or rwanda or return to their home country
<START> advocacy groups working on behalf of the migrants had challenged the deportation plans in israels high court , securing a temporary freeze on the plan on march 15
<START> moves to expel african asylum seekers were largely popular with the right-wing governments base , which views them as economic migrants who entered the country illegally in search of work
<START> but liberal israelis argued that many of the migrants would face persecution if they returned home , with some critics of deportation comparing the asylum seekers plight to that facing jews fleeing nazi germany
<START> the future of israels dreamers
<START> netanyahus office noted that the initial plans to send the migrants to third-country destinations had encountered legal constraints and political difficulties and that the government had to adopt a new approach as result
<START> bottinick said that several legal developments in the third-country destinations had interfered with israels plan to send the migrants there , in turn leading to renewed talks between the unhcr and israel , with deliberations gathering speed over the past few weeks
<START> some pro-migrant groups had welcomed the decision
<START> the hotline for refugees and migrants , a group that advocated for asylum seekers , welcomed the news , noting that it was symbolic that the announcement had happened during passover , the holiday of freedom.
<START> but many felt that the decision had come out of the blue
<START> jakubowicz , a supporter of the previous policy , said he hoped the agreement with the unhcr would be a positive , but he said many israelis were hoping to see more migrants leave
<START> the government will face opposition , he said
