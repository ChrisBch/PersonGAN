<START> last november , north korean soldier oh chong song made a dash toward freedom through the korean peninsulas demilitarized zone
<START> his fellow north koreans fired at him , hitting him at least five times and leaving him fighting for his life
<START> when doctors in the south treated the 25-year-old , they found more problems , including an infection of parasitic worms
<START> despite all this , oh survived
<START> and this week , roughly a year after he escaped from the north , he gave his first interview to a foreign media publication
<START> in it , the defector offered a grim picture of life inside north korea and the factors that motivated him to escape
<START> oh told the japanese newspaper sankei shimbun , referring to the increase in tensions between washington and pyongyang during the year he escaped
<START> the sankei shimbun published a video of its interview with oh , which did not show his face but featured a man talking with a slight north korean accent
<START> the newspaper said japanese security services confirmed ohs identity
<START> in his interview , oh revealed that his father was a major general and suggested that he had enjoyed a relatively comfortable lifestyle growing up in north korea
<START> however , he said he was indifferent to the rule of kim jong un and had no loyalty to the north korean regime
<START> oh estimated that roughly 80 percent of his generation felt the same way
<START> he added , according to a translation by agence france-presse
<START> the soldiers dramatic escape from north korea captivated many people around the world
<START> despite the heavy military presence , panmunjom is best known as a tourist area now
<START> the last time a shooting took place in the joint security area was 1984 , when a soviet citizen tried to sprint to the southern side of the border
<START> a north korean soldier last defected in 2007 , but no gunfire was exchanged at the site at that time
<START> ohs defection was captured on closed-circuit television footage later released by the u.s. military
<START> it showed the young soldier driving a jeep-like vehicle before it got stuck in a ditch
<START> he then jumped out of the vehicle and began running , while other north korean soldiers shot at him
<START> in his interview with the sankei shimbun , oh denied reports in the south korean press that he was wanted for murder in north korea
<START> instead , he said , he had been drinking after getting into trouble with his friends
<START> after breaking through a checkpoint , he had become fearful of being executed , so he had just kept going in a bid to escape
<START> ohs injuries were so severe that a u.s. rescue crew that loaded him onto a black hawk helicopter initially thought he might not survive.
<START> its truly a miracle , sgt
<START> 1st class gopal singh told the washington post last december
<START> south koreans were so gripped by ohs case that the trauma surgeon who treated him , lee cook-jong , became a celebrity in the country
<START> oh told the sankei shimbun that he was discharged from the hospital in february but still commutes from the suburbs of seoul to the city center for continued treatment
<START> the south korean newspaper chosun ilbo said it was highly unusual for a north korean defector to talk to japanese media , as defectors are generally kept under close watch by south koreas intelligence services
<START> seouls unification ministry would not confirm whether oh had gone to japan , the newspaper reported
