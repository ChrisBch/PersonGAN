<START> u.s. presidents always grab headlines for their annual speeches at the u.n. general assembly , and this year is no different
<START> but president trumps main event may actually come wednesday , when he chairs a meeting of the u.n. security council
<START> trump will have to contend with obvious rivals such as china and russia , as well as disillusioned allies such as britain and france
<START> but theres also a wild card in the mix evo morales , bolivias leftist president
<START> bolivia joined the security council for a two-year term in 2017
<START> five seats on the security council , the most powerful u.n. organ , are permanent and given to major powers britain , china , france , russia and the united states
<START> the remaining 10 seats are given to other u.n. members on a rotating basis
<START> bolivia has been extremely critical of u.s. foreign policy since morales took office in 2006
<START> in 2008 , it expelled the u.s. ambassador there and threw out american departments such as the u.s. agency for international development and the drug enforcement administration
<START> and few leaders have been as openly critical of trump as morales , who has said he thinks the u.s. president has mental problems and racist attitudes toward latin americans
<START> over the past 21 months , bolivia has used its security council seat to needle the united states
<START> said santiago anria , a professor of latin american politics at dickinson college
<START> anria said the bolivian leader may bring up some of his major disagreements with washington , including on u.s. unilateralism , the israeli-palestinian conflict and alleged american intervention in the affairs of nations such as venezuela
<START> morales remains allies with venezuelan president nicols maduro , who is a frequent target of the trump administrations criticism
<START> bolivia , a nonaligned country , will probably be in step with the rest of the council against the united states on wednesday
<START> the meeting is widely expected to focus on iran
<START> european allies such as britain and france have criticized trump for pulling out of the 2015 iran nuclear deal , while china and russia also oppose the u.s. policy
<START> all four countries are signatories to the agreement
<START> llorenti , the diplomat , said the bolivian government had not discussed tactics with other countries and was instead focused on doing what was best for the united nations
<START> i can not tell you exactly what our president will say , he said.
<START> but for us its very important to analyze the root causes of conflicts in the middle east
