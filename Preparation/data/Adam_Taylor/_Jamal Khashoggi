<START> more than a week after the disappearance of jamal khashoggi , all parties involved agree that the journalist walked into saudi arabias consulate in istanbul on the afternoon of oct. 2
<START> when it comes to what happened next , however , the saudis have a very different story
<START> saudi arabia says khashoggi left the consulate , where he was seeking papers that would allow him to marry his turkish fiancee , after an unremarkable visit
<START> yet turkish authorities , as well as the missing saudi journalists friends and family , say khashoggi did not come out of the consulate , where his fiancee was waiting for him outside
<START> with little evidence officially put forward by either side , journalists from the washington post and other news organizations have reported on unreleased details about the investigation , some of which have been obtained from turkish officials speaking off the record
<START> these details suggest that khashoggi was killed at the consulate
<START> there has been some corroboration from other sources , including by u.s. intelligence officials who said saudi arabias powerful crown prince , mohammed bin salman , had been trying to lure khashoggi back to the kingdom
<START> but the middle east is deeply divided by geopolitical interests and is a place where leaks of information and misinformation are often intended to drive narratives
<START> turkey and saudi arabia sit on opposing sides of this divide , and both have a reputation for muddying the water
<START> to further the governments position , said steven cook of the council on foreign relations
<START> saudi arabia has not offered any compelling evidence or even a plausible alternative hypothesis for what happened inside the consulate it has said that security cameras at the facility did not record footage
<START> instead , it has tried to undermine the reports about khashoggi by focusing on the source of information and the idea that turkey does not have a neutral viewpoint
<START> said cook , who added that he thinks khashoggi was killed inside the consulate
<START> under president recep tayyip erdogan , turkey has cracked down on the countrys once-vibrant and relatively free media world
<START> it ranks 157 in reporters without borders world press freedom index , having dropped more than 50 spots in a decade
<START> the committee to protect journalists says more journalists are imprisoned in turkey than in any other country
<START> some of the information attributed to turkish officials presents a contradictory account of what may have happened in the consulate
<START> one report suggested that the turkish government may have video of the alleged killing of khashoggi , while other outlets have suggested that some officials think the journalist is still alive
<START> hellyer , a senior nonresident fellow with the atlantic council in london , said the chaotic nature of the turkish leaks in the immediate aftermath of khashoggis disappearance may have been an attempt to pressure saudi arabia
<START> publications funded by the saudi government and its allies appear to be attempting to cast doubt on the case , rather than present a rival theory
<START> salah khashoggi remains in saudi arabia , however , raising questions about whether any interview conducted with him would have been under duress
<START> the saudi-erdogan relationship is stressed , ali shihabi , founder of the arabia foundation , a pro-riyadh think tank in washington , wrote on twitter over the weekend
<START> he said turkey would need to present absolutely irrefutable evidence for its allegations to be believed
<START> turkey has remained a key ally for qatar even as saudi arabia led a blockade of the tiny oil-rich state
<START> turkey even sent troops to qatar in a show of strength and support last year
<START> the qatar-saudi spat has become notorious for acts of subterfuge and the leaks of information and misinformation
<START> qatari-linked hackers are widely suspected of leaking the personal emails of yousef al-otaiba , ambassador to the united states for the united arab emirates , a key saudi ally
<START> the move appeared to be a response to a hack of qatari government websites that u.s. officials say the uae orchestrated
<START> all these media operations take their cues from state apparatuses , directly or otherwise , so it makes it really difficult to rely on them independently , without double and triple verification
<START> but despite saudi arabias narrative on khashoggis disappearance , unver said he was surprised not to have seen similar levels of propaganda from either side about the case even though turkey was perhaps the most active country in this field , he said
<START> for the united states , finding out conclusively what happened to khashoggi will prove important to its middle east policy
<START> he said , because they have been so bad on this
