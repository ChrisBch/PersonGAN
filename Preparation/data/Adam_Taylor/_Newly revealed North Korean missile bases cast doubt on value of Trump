<START> on monday , a new report from a washington think tank identified more than a dozen hidden bases in north korea that could be used to disperse mobile launchers for ballistic missiles in the event of a conflict
<START> are these bases evidence that north korea is cheating on the agreement it reached in june , when president trump met north korean leader kim jong un in singapore
<START> analysts say the answer is no although there are plenty of caveats
<START> joseph bermudez , victor cha and lisa collins of the center for strategic and international studies used satellite imagery and interviews with north korean defectors and government officials to identify 13 missile bases
<START> they say there are seven more bases that remain hidden
<START> the report noted
<START> north korea dramatically improved its missile technology with provocative test launches last year
<START> western experts eventually concluded that pyongyang now has the ability to hit most of the united states , although it remains unclear if it could produce a nuclear weapon small enough to fit atop a missile
<START> of the peninsula
<START> the report is the latest evidence that while north korea has indeed stopped its missile testing , it is far from dismantling its weapons facilities
<START> the state department did not say whether they viewed the base as a violation of any agreements with the united states.
<START> president trump has made clear that should chairman kim follow through on his commitments including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs a much brighter future lies ahead for north korea and its people , a spokesman said in a statement
<START> there have been several recent signs that diplomatic efforts between the united states and north korea were stalling
<START> a meeting scheduled for last week between pompeo and pyongyangs nuclear negotiator , kim yong chol , was postponed unexpectedly , only days after north korean state media released a commentary that suggested missile testing could resume if progress was not made on talks
<START> analysts have long believed that north korea had undeclared or hidden facilities in their missile program , which has made issues related to verification and inspections a major part of working level talks between the u.s. and north korea
<START> pyongyang may have wanted the missile sites to be seen , suggested david maxwell , a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies , to keep the pressure on in negotiations
<START> however , he added , the report could also make the current stalemate between washington and pyongyang last longer than expected.
