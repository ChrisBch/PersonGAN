<START> since president trump took office , he has become a vocal if , given his history , somewhat unlikely supporter of saudi arabia
<START> his first trip abroad after taking office was to riyadh since then , he has expressed support for the controversial reforms that are being led by crown prince mohammed bin salman
<START> khashoggi , a washington post contributor , has been a u.s. resident
<START> but these moments of criticism have not been in response to issues surrounding human rights or the persecution of dissidents , as in the case of khashoggi
<START> instead , they have been focused on arms sales and other financial issues
<START> these aspects of the u.s.-saudi arabia relationship have long existed , but are rarely made as public as they are under the trump administration
<START> one of trumps most stinging criticisms of saudi arabia came the same day khashoggi disappeared
<START> at a campaign rally on oct. 2 in southaven , miss. , trump told the crowd that saudi arabia would collapse without u.s. support
<START> trump has made some variations of this comment in the past
<START> in april , while appearing at a news conference with french president emmanuel macron , he made a critical reference to unnamed allies in the middle east who he thought were not doing enough to help syria
<START> at times , he has made these comments directly to his saudi counterparts
<START> you should have increased it , he told mohammed , as the crown prince laughed
<START> this isnt just for show
<START> in may , trump sent a letter to a number of gulf allies that asked them to do more in countries such as syria and urged them to find a quick resolution to the dispute between a saudi-led bloc and qatar
<START> it was unclear how the iranian leader , a major rival for saudi arabia and other gulf states , had seen the letter
<START> trump has repeatedly brought up the $ 7 trillion figure in public comments it is an inaccurate reference for the cost of the wars in the middle east
<START> trumps criticism has not gone without notice in the middle east
<START> after his comments in april , abdulkhaleq abdulla , a well-known emirati political commentator , tweeted to the u.s. president on tuesday that his country and others will survive after trump is gone
<START> however , gulf allies have avoided publicly responding to trumps remarks
<START> much of trumps frustration with saudi arabia is because he believes the country has not fulfilled its commitment to buy u.s. weapons
<START> it is unclear why the saudis allowed that deal to expire , given their concern about missiles from houthis in yemen
<START> the kingdom also had been exploring a purchase of russias s-400 missile system , however
<START> even so , although trump may have repeatedly put pressure on saudi arabia to buy more american weapons and share more costs in the middle east , his remarks after khashoggis disappearance suggest that riyadh may have considerable leverage in its relationship with washington
