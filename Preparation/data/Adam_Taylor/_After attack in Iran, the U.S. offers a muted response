<START> in the hours after a suspected terrorist attack on a military parade in the iranian city of ahvaz on saturday left more than two dozen dead , countries around the world offered their sympathies to the victims
<START> some analysts wondered , however , why there wasnt a stronger response from the united states
<START> neither the white house nor the state department released statements within the first few hours after the attack
<START> when worldviews contacted national security council spokesman garrett marquis on saturday afternoon to ask whether the white house would be issuing a statement , marquis offered his own brief response
<START> marquis said in an email
<START> this muted stance was in contrast to that of other nations , which offered their sympathies to the victims and condemnation of the attack , with several ambassadors in tehran writing personal messages , while leaders such as russian president vladimir putin released official statements
<START> a shocking terrorist attack
<START> wherever it happens terrorism must be condemned
<START> all our condolences to the families of the victims
<START> austria offers heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of the horrific terrorist attack in ahwaz
<START> i would also like to sincerely hope the early recovery of those who were injured
<START> the united states was not the only country to delay its messages of condolence to iran notably , unlike many other nations , it does not have an ambassador in tehran
<START> however , some analysts suggested that the scale of the attack merited a response from a senior u.s. figure
<START> it would be truly shameful if potus and secpompeo fail to unequivocally condemn todays terrorist attacks in ahvaz
<START> trump himself often offers quick responses on twitter to suspected terrorist attacks , especially those that appear to have been perpetrated by the islamic state extremist group
<START> the islamic state released a statement that asserted responsibility for saturdays attack shortly after it occurred , though a separatist arab militant group also said it was behind the attack
<START> it was not immediately clear whether either group had organized the violence
<START> iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif later called that message repugnant
<START> repugnant wh statement & senate sanctions as iranians counter terror backed by us clients.iranian people reject such us claims of friendship
<START> tehran and washington have for many years had tense relations over a wide variety of issues , including irans nuclear program and american influence in the middle east
<START> the two nations have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980
<START> a number of iranian officials , including zarif and president hassan rouhani , are expected to travel to trumps hometown of new york city next week for high-level meetings at the united nations general assembly
<START> though many are expecting a tense reception from the american leader , trump has suggested he would be open to meeting rouhani on the sidelines of the u.n. events
