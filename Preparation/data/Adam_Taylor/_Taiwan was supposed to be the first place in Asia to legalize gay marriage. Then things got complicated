<START> a little less than a year and a half ago , taiwan seemed to be on the verge of allowing same-sex marriage
<START> in may 2017 , the islands constitutional court ruled that its civil code , which stated that only a man and a woman could marry , violated constitutional guarantees and gave the legislature two years to amend it or pass new legislation
<START> the move seemed certain to cement taiwans status as a haven in asia for lgbt activism indeed , it could not have happened without decades of activism
<START> taiwan looked set to become the first place in asia to legalize same-sex unions
<START> however , things have not worked out quite so simply
<START> this saturday , the island will vote in a referendum on whether to amend the civil code to allow same-sex marriage
<START> and despite accusations of misinformation and propaganda , conservatives have mounted a powerful campaign against taiwans lgbt movement , raising the real prospect that same-sex marriage could fail n the island
<START> indeed , though taiwan is considered one of the most open to lgbt rights of all asian countries , polls suggest that it may well vote against same-sex marriage
<START> one recent survey from the taiwanese public opinion foundation found that 77 percent of the islands population was opposed to amending the civil code
<START> to many activists , a large part of the problem lies with the government of president tsai ing-wen and her democratic progressive party ( dpp )
<START> with her partys popularity falling because of a stagnant economy and political pressure from china , the president has been hesitant to push the potentially divisive issue of same-sex marriage
<START> tsai once spoke in favor of marriage equality , but she has taken a neutral stance ahead of the vote , apparently hoping to appease both the young voters who largely support gay marriage and the older voters who largely oppose it
<START> saturdays referendum will take place on the same day as a midterm election that could be a key test of tsais political leadership
<START> and there will be a total of 10 different referendums held on the day , including a geopolitically contentious vote on using the name taiwan rather than chinese taipei in international sporting events a move that could provoke anger from china
<START> notably , civic organizations spearheaded the same-sex marriage referendums , rather than the government
<START> in fact , there are four separate same-sex marriage ballot issues organized by opposing organizations two proposed by conservatives and one proposed by pro-lgbt rights groups as well as two separate questions about the teaching of lgbt issues to children in taiwanese schools
<START> ahead of the vote , there has been an avalanche of advertisements in taiwanese media
<START> taiwan has had referendums before , though none have passed
<START> but changes to the law mean the threshold for approval has dropped from 50 percent of eligible voters to 25 percent
<START> theres certainly a possibility , however remote , that both pro- and anti-gay marriage referendums could pass , providing a contradictory result for lgbt activists
<START> while the referendum result cant negate the constitutional courts 2017 decision or the may 2019 deadline for implementing it , it could well influence what the government does next in particular , whether it amends the civil code or proposes a new law
<START> for many lgbt activists , the fear is that they will end up with legal same-sex unions but without full marriage equality and that what once seemed like a great leap forward will not mark a real step in the right direction after all
