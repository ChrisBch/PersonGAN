<START> united nations en route to new york to visit the united nations , palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas stopped over in dublin last weekend
<START> while greeting the palestinian delegation , irish foreign affairs minister simon coveney told reporters that his government was committed to recognizing a palestinian state as part of a middle east peace process
<START> but what if peace talks with israel fail
<START> we may have to forget the second part of that , coveney said
<START> the comment drew headlines in irish news media and caught the attention of middle east-watchers worldwide
<START> speaking at the united nations on thursday , coveney emphasized that he was not promising to recognize a palestinian state in the near future , but raising the possibility that it could happen if peace talks stalled
<START> coveney told the washington post
<START> who knows what the u.s. will propose
<START> he asked of the trump administrations long-awaited peace plan
<START> ireland isnt the only european country pondering the recognition of a palestinian state
<START> last week , spains foreign minister , josep borrell , told a conference of european union leaders that if that supranational body did not recognize a palestinian state , spain would consider whether to recognize it unilaterally
<START> and this week , british labour leader jeremy corbyn told his party conference that if he was elected , his government would recognize a palestinian state immediately a high-profile affirmation of the left-wing partys policy under his leadership
<START> some countries have recently followed through colombia announced last month that it would recognize a palestinian state
<START> there are 137 u.n. member nations that have given recognition to a palestinian state
<START> much of asia , latin america and africa recognize it but the united states , along with fellow israeli allies canada and australia , do not
<START> europe is split , with nine out of 28 e.u
<START> member states recognizing a palestinian state in 2014 , sweden became the first e.u
<START> member state to decide to do so ( other e.u
<START> nations , most of which are in eastern europe , recognized it before joining the organization )
<START> some liberal israeli commentators wondered if they were witnessing a real shift
<START> meir javedanfar , an iranian-born israeli analyst based in tel aviv , wrote on twitter that israelis needed to reflect upon their own role in what was happening.
<START> we are also responsible , he wrote , before referring to the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank
<START> the irish diplomat said that many in his country felt strongly about the israeli-palestinian conflict , in part as ireland was going through its own peace process with britain during the oslo accords in the 1990s
<START> he also noted that under the leadership of prime minister leo varadkar , ireland is making a push for a global ireland foreign policy , opening new embassies abroad and campaigning for a seat on the u.n. security council
<START> miller wrote in an email
<START> its a strange tactic , put it that way.
<START> ireland has traditionally been a strong u.s. ally , but coveney and the center-right government of varadkar have been at odds with the trump administration over a variety of foreign policy issues
<START> the president was scheduled to visit dublin in november , but the trip was canceled amid reports of planned protests
<START> during his own visit to the united nations this week , trump said he supported a two-state solution
<START> the president also said that his administrations delayed peace plan rollout would happen within four months
<START> coveney said that although hes heard rumors about what was in the u.s. plan , he did not know what it would include
<START> miller said that the trump administrations position may in fact be emboldened by such moves.
<START> theyve effectively been telling abbas the games over
<START> you lost , he said
