<START> ongoing talks with north korea have raised the possibility of a future with far less tension on the korean peninsula even , possibly , a declaration of the end of the korean war
<START> but that should not change the long-standing military relationship that cements the u.s.-south korea relationship , a delegation of south korean officials who visited washington this week argued
<START> said hoon sul , a representative in south koreas national assembly
<START> hoon was part of a six-person delegation led by choo mi-ae , former leader of the governing democratic party and a key ally of south korean president moon jae-in
<START> in a group interview wednesday , choo said the lawmakers had come to washington in a bid to explain seouls position to their counterparts in congress
<START> the visit came just days before secretary of state mike pompeo was due to return to pyongyang to try to kick-start denuclearization talks with north korea
<START> one key topic of discussion during pompeos trip may be whether the united states will agree to a declaration that the korean war is officially over
<START> during a recent interview with the washington post , south korean foreign minister kang kyung-wha said such a declaration could be made in return for north korea permanently dismantling its nuclear facilities in yongbyon
<START> i think thats a huge step forward for denuclearization , kang said
<START> speaking on wednesday , choo summed up the south korean policy as no war , no nukes and no gap the last part referring to no gap in expectations between south korea and the united states
<START> she said the u.s. lawmakers she had met had expressed skepticism that north korea is sincere about its willingness to give up nuclear weapons
<START> choo said , adding one possibility might be that legislators from both south korea and the united states could head to north korea to observe the destruction of yongbyon and other facilities
<START> the korean war halted with a truce in 1953 , but a formal peace treaty was never signed
<START> north korea has demanded a peace treaty in a number of recent propaganda missives the u.s. president has suggested at points he considers the end of the war a possibility
<START> however , many in washington inside and outside the administration are skeptical about such a move
<START> one particular concern is an end-of-war declaration ( and beyond that , a subsequent peace treaty ) could be used by north korea and china to demand the removal of the 28,500 u.s. forces stationed in south korea
<START> recent polls of the american public have found strong support for keeping at least some of these troops in south korea even if north korea denuclearizes
<START> the situation is complicated by trumps own criticism of the u.s. military presence in south korea
<START> trump has said he would be willing to withdraw troops from the korean peninsula if seoul did not pay more for their upkeep
<START> u.s. military bases are also controversial within south korea , with many on the left , including supporters of moon , pondering the withdrawal of troops
<START> in april , blue house foreign policy adviser moon chung-in wrote that it would be difficult to justify u.s. troops continuing presence in south korea if a peace treaty were signed
<START> following the collapse of the previous right-wing park gyun-hye administration under the weight of numerous scandals , south koreas conservative politicians typically the most pro-american force in the country are in crisis , with little influence in politics at the national level
<START> choo said that despite this , it was the position of president moon and his liberal predecessor , kim dae-jung , that u.s. troops should remain on the peninsula
