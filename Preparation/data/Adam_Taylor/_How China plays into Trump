<START> when president trump announced saturday that the united states would be pulling out of a landmark nuclear-arms agreement with russia , he blamed moscow for the decision
<START> trump told reporters in nevada , referring to the intermediate-range nuclear forces ( inf ) treaty.
<START> i dont know why president obama didnt negotiate or pull out.
<START> but trump also hinted that another country played a role , one that it isnt even party to the treaty china
<START> why does china play into trumps decision-making on the treaty
<START> and what effect does he think pulling out of the agreement might have on relations with beijing
<START> heres a guide
<START> what is the inf treaty
<START> the treaty bars the united states and russia , along with a number of post-soviet states , from possessing , producing or test-flying ground-launched nuclear cruise missiles with a ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers ( 300 to 3,400 miles )
<START> the agreement was signed in 1987 by president ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and took effect the following year after it was ratified by the u.s. senate
<START> it came after years of negotiations , sparked by the installation of weapons systems that put western europe within easy reach of a soviet missile strike
<START> in many ways , the treaty was a real success
<START> it was the first agreement to actually reduce nuclear missile stockpiles
<START> by 1991 , nearly 2,700 u.s. and soviet missiles were eliminated
<START> the pact is the only cold war arms-control agreement that remains in force
<START> in recent years , however , there has been talk of violations by both sides
<START> the united states is particularly concerned by a ground-launched cruise missile known as the ssc-8 , while russia says that missile-defense installations in europe violate the treaty
<START> how does china factor in to deliberations
<START> china has never been a party to the inf treaty
<START> as such , it hasnt had the same limitations placed upon its stockpiles of short- and intermediate-range missiles for the past three decades
<START> he added that 95 percent of those missiles would violate the inf treaty if china were a signatory
<START> for the trump administration , pressuring china is key part of its foreign policy
<START> at the start of the year , defense secretary jim mattis unveiled a new pentagon strategy that identified china and russia as key threats to the united states and called for sustained financial investment in the military to overcome a period of strategic atrophy.
<START> meanwhile , trumps aggressive trade policy against china has widely been interpreted as a broader attempt to control and contain a rising china before it is too late
<START> national security adviser john bolton , believed to be a driving force behind trumps move , has suggested that china may even be a more important factor than russia
<START> he has told u.s. allies that the inf treaty puts the united states in an excessively weak position against russia and more importantly china , one diplomat told the washington post
<START> could the united states get china to agree to inf-style restrictions
<START> its not clear what exactly the united states is hoping to achieve , but there may be hopes for a new treaty that would include china
<START> such an idea may even get support from moscow , which has voiced concerns about chinese missiles in the past
<START> wrote m. taylor fravel , an associate professor of political science at mit , on twitter
<START> could the united states try to match china in the region
<START> experts such as sayers have suggested that installing the ground-based missile systems banned by the inf treaty could open chinas interior to u.s. attacks , increasing chinas need for costly defense systems
<START> congresss annual defense authorization bill has funded research and development into weapons that could potentially violate the inf treaty , specifically making the argument that these weapons could be used to counter china if the agreement were scrapped
<START> a big question , however , is how useful such missiles would actually be in a standoff with china
<START> the inf treaty banned ground-launched missiles , but the united states does not have easy access to that much land around china
<START> missiles could certainly be placed in guam , a u.s. island territory in the pacific , but placing them in countries such as japan or the philippines would require more complicated negotiations
