<START> brazilian president-elect jair bolsonaro , who is known for his far-right views , has told an israeli newspaper that he hopes to move brazils embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem after taking office
<START> if brazil were to move its embassy to jerusalem , it would be following the policy of the trump administration , which recognized jerusalem as the israeli capital last year and moved the u.s. embassy from tel aviv in may
<START> jerusalem is a contested city
<START> palestinians consider east jerusalem , captured by israel in the 1967 arab-israeli war , the capital of their future independent state palestinian officials have refused to engage with their u.s. counterparts since the u.s. embassy move
<START> only guatemala and paraguay have followed the u.s. lead ( though paraguay later reversed its decision )
<START> a number of countries , including australia , have suggested they might move their embassy in the future , however
<START> brazil and israel have a long diplomatic history dating to the very foundation of the state of israel , and brazil has a sizable population of jews , many of whom descended from refugees from europe in the mid-20th century
<START> however , in more recent years , the two nations have had a sometimes-fraught relationship
<START> in 2014 , after brazil condemned the disproportionate use of force by israel in the gaza strip and recalled its ambassador , an israeli foreign ministry spokesman called brazil a diplomatic dwarf and an irrelevant diplomatic partner.
<START> bolsonaro , a 27-year congressman with few legislative achievements who overcame chaos within brazils political establishment to win the presidency , will take office jan. 1
<START> he has indicated frequently that he hopes for a closer relationship with israel
<START> the feeling may be mutual
<START> israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu tweeted that he had congratulated bolsonaro on his election victory
<START> the israeli leader is widely expected to attend bolsonaros inauguration next year
<START> bolsonaro is also expected to make israel his first foreign trip
<START> i spoke this evening with the president-elect of brazil , jairbolsonaro
<START> i congratulated him on his victory
<START> i told him im certain his election will lead to a great friendship between our peoples and a strengthening of brazil-israel ties
<START> we are waiting for his visit to israel
<START> the palestinian embassy is less than two miles from planalto palace , brazils government headquarters
<START> under the government of luiz incio lula da silva , brazil recognized a sovereign palestinian state something bolsonaro has previously suggested he is against , comparing it to negotiating with terrorists
<START> he told israel hayom
<START> bolsonaro has been a polarizing figure at home and has a long history of controversial comments about gay people and women
<START> he has frequently extolled the military dictatorship that ruled brazil between 1964 and 1985
<START> many critics have suggested his country does not have the clout , however , to pursue the kind of aggressive foreign policy practiced by the united states under president trump
<START> it would be throwing away $ 6 billion per year in poultry sales to arab countries , rubens barbosa , a former brazilian ambassador to washington , said of the proposal to move the embassy in israel , according to the associated press
