<START> tokyo north korea could be taking preliminary steps to close its nuclear test site , according to new satellite images that suggest kim jong un might be making good on one of the surprising pledges hes made over the past month
<START> or , hes making the rest of the world think he is by arranging a performance for the satellites that pass overhead
<START> satellite images taken since last months inter-korean summit show a steady reduction in the number of buildings around north koreas known nuclear test site , built under mount mantap in the punggye-ri area in the north of the country
<START> at the very least , this is a welcome pr move , said jeffrey lewis , head of the east asia program at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , calif
<START> lewis said , citing commercial satellite images from the san francisco-based firm planet labs that have a resolution comparable to google maps.
<START> something is clearly happening there.
<START> as part of the extraordinary rapprochement going on , north korea has vowed to dismantle the test site , where all six of its nuclear detonations have taken place , this month
<START> but as with so many things about north korea , its difficult to tell how much of this is wheat and how much is chaff
<START> kim made the pledge during a historic summit with south korean president moon jae-in , which laid the groundwork for a meeting between kim and president trump , which trump announced thursday would take place june 12 in singapore
<START> kim said he would invite security experts and journalists to the north to observe the closure of the site , the souths presidential blue house said
<START> north korea promises to dismantle its nuclear test site in public view , south says
<START> all six of north koreas nuclear tests have taken place deep under the mountain at punggye-ri , with five of them occurring in the tunnel complex accessed through an entrance known as the north portal
<START> there are two other entrances to the site , the west and south portals
<START> the last test , in september last year , was so huge that some experts wondered whether mount mantap was suffering from tired mountain syndrome and had become unusable
<START> but nuclear experts have cast doubt on that theory , noting that even if the tunnels leading to the north portal were unusable , the other two entrances could still be operational
<START> tunneling and activity at the west portal had been visible as recently as april 20 , a week before the inter-korean summit , according to an analysis for 38 north , a website devoted to north korea
<START> there are clusters of buildings at the portals , including administration buildings and a command center , as well as smaller buildings
<START> the big , main buildings are still there but the smaller , more peripheral ones at the north and south portals , the entrances to the main tunnels , have come down , lewis said
<START> this could be part of the preparations for inviting journalists and experts to watch the closure of the site , which , lewis said , could be as simple and as reversible as blocking the portals
<START> and the tunnels are always going to be there , he added , unless north korea blows up the whole site
<START> north koreas mountain mystery is punggye-ri nuclear test site still functional
<START> but skeptics say that closing a test site that might well be spent is just cosmetic
<START> a group of chinese scientists last month said they believe that the test site collapsed after septembers huge test , which caused an earthquake so big that satellites caught images of the mountain above the site moving
<START> north korea claimed to have detonated a hydrogen bomb , which would be exponentially more powerful than the atomic devices previously tested , and experts said the size of the earthquake suggested that it had indeed been a hydrogen , or thermonuclear , explosion
<START> in their study , which will be published in the journal science on thursday , they argued that by using satellite radar imagery to supplement ground-based seismological readings , they were able to gain a more accurate picture of the sept. 3 test
<START> sylvain barbot , a researcher with the earth observatory of singapore , wrote in an email that the nuclear test last year was so large that we could feel it from space.
<START> the amount of shaking that accompanied the explosion was so severe that traditional radar measurements were inaccurate , barbot said , and his team had to use unusual techniques to compensate for significant changes in the landscape
<START> by using these techniques , the researchers were able to estimate a depth for the nuclear detonation around 450 meters , or roughly 1,500 feet , beneath the summit of mount mantap
<START> researchers then combined this information with seismological readings to come up with an estimated yield for the weapon of 120 to 304 kilotons
<START> much of this range would be far higher than officials from the united states and south korea estimate
<START> the researchers also found evidence that a significant part of mount mantap had collapsed after the explosion , supporting the chinese study
<START> a very large part of the facility had collapsed , barbot said , not merely a tunnel or two.
