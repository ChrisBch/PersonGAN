<START> australia is yet again in the midst of political instability , with prime minister malcolm turnbull widely expected to be forced from office in the coming days
<START> much of the pressure is coming from within his own party
<START> peter dutton , turnbulls former home affairs minister , is expected to make his own bid to lead the conservative liberal party in the coming days
<START> if dutton wins the leadership contest , he will be the countrys sixth prime minister in just over a decade a level of turnover that worries some analysts
<START> in the midst of the turmoil , however , some australians have found an unlikely source of hope a 30-year-old american who lives in texas who runs his own popcorn company and has never been to australia
<START> a search for the austin-based duttons handle on twitter the simple , peterdutton5 show that a number of people had mistaken him for the australian dutton
<START> some had sent insulting messages one message called him and turnbull losers who were making stupid political moves
<START> in response , dutton wrote a message wednesday that begged australian social media users to look at his photo before sending him messages
<START> i wish the people of australia would look at my profile and realize im a 30 yr old black man before sending me tweets and dms
<START> but one twitter user asked dutton if would be interested in taking over the australian government , to which he replied , sign me up
<START> sign me up
<START> this sparked a series of tweets , now shared and liked thousands of times , and made him a topic of discussion in australian politics with many twitter users imploring him to come over and take over the prime ministers office himself
<START> packing my bags
<START> the texas dutton isnt the only american to be mistaken for the man who is likely to be australias next prime minister either ( who uses the twitter username peterdutton_mp )
<START> peter dutton , director of the china maritime studies institute at the u.s
<START> naval war college and peter_dutton , was also accused of destroying australian democracy in a series of messages this week
<START> i beg your pardon
<START> another american twitter user with the name peter dutton even changed his display name on the website to peter from queens , not queensland
<START> this dutton has apparently been receiving insults intended for his australian namesake for years
<START> i 've been to australia once , in 1998 , and nothing that 's happened there since is my fault
<START> in 2014 , he even received an apology from the man himself ( and the offer of a drink , next time hes in australia )
<START> thanks but no - i get my fair share
<START> i will buy you a drink next time you 're in aus
<START> theres a reason the peter duttons of social media are receiving angry messages
<START> if the australian dutton succeeds in his leadership challenge to turnbull , no australian prime minister will have served out the full three-year term since john howard in 2004 to 2007
<START> the high level of turnover in the country is unusual , given the relatively strong state of the australian economy
<START> experts suggest that quirks of the countrys parliamentary political system , as well as the dominance of its right-wing media , has led to what the financial times describes as italian-style political instability
<START> dutton the australian politician , rather than any of the american counterparts is a figure from the liberal partys right wing , as opposed to the more centrist turnbull
<START> as home affairs minister , he was a defender of australias controversial offshore asylum-seeker facilities and also championed the idea of canberra offering refugee status to white farmers from south africa an issue that president trump brought up this week
<START> many of the messages directed to the austin-based dutton asked him for his views on human rights
<START> you are all my brothers and sisters so ill treat you as such , unless you show otherwise
<START> speaking to the australian broadcasting corporation , the texan dutton said that while he wasnt an expert on australian politics , he had been following u.s. politics closely
<START> a lot of things i thought id only ever see again in history books have awakened in our present day since the trump transition , he said
<START> after the outpouring of attention wednesday evening from australia , dutton thanked his well-wishers for support , pledged to bring his popcorn to australia but said he had to get back to his 20-week pregnant wife
<START> in a message thursday morning , however , he reaffirmed his hope of being australias next prime minister
<START> im awake and still the peoples choice for prime minister of australia
<START> i take great honor in it and will represent you with pride from texas.love each other a little more and well get through this together , mates
