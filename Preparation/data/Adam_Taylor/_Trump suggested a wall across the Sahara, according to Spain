<START> president trump had a suggestion for how spain could deal with europes migration crisis during a recent meeting with foreign minister josep borrell , according to reports in the spanish media
<START> the idea was simple build a wall across the sahara.
<START> el pas and europa press reported this week that borrell recalled trumps suggestion during a luncheon in madrid on tuesday
<START> the spanish embassy in washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment , but the spanish foreign ministry told britains guardian newspaper that the accounts of borrells comments were accurate
<START> according to those accounts , borrell told his audience that trump had compared the situation in northern africa and the mediterranean to that along the u.s. border with mexico
<START> during his campaign , trump had promised to build a wall along the southern border with mexico and force the mexican government to pay for it
<START> borrell said that he did not support a wall along the border between the united states and mexico and that spanish diplomats had told trump that the situation was considerably different in scale anyway
<START> trump disagreed , according to borrells recollection , adding that the sahara border cant be bigger than our border with mexico
<START> the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment
<START> though estimates vary , u.s. customs and border protection says that the border between the united states and mexico is roughly 1,900 miles long
<START> most estimates for the sahara put it at about 3,000 miles long from east to west
<START> a wall across the sahara would probably also involve building through several sovereign nations
<START> the desert spreads over parts of 11 countries algeria , chad , egypt , eritrea , libya , mali , mauritania , morocco , niger , sudan and tunisia
<START> it was unclear from the spanish media whether trump was speaking in jest when he made the purported comments
<START> borrell had accompanied spains king felipe vi and queen letizia to the white house in june
<START> spain has seen rising numbers of migrants and refugees arrive on its shores in recent months , the result of a crackdown on a central mediterranean route between libya and italy
<START> according to the international organization for migration , more than 33,000 people have arrived in spain via the western mediterranean in 2018 three times as many as in the same period last year
<START> the left-wing government of prime minister pedro snchez , in power since june , has attempted to welcome the new arrivals accepting migrant rescue boats such as the mv aquarius after italy rejected them
<START> he told the washington post during the june visit to the united states.
<START> this is not the case of spain.
<START> his comments at the luncheon this week appear to affirm , however , that migration and identity are the most important issues facing the continent
<START> he said , according to el pas
