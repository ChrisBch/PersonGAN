<START> seoul north korean officials did not turn up to a thursday meeting with the u.s. military about repatriating the remains of the war dead , according to a u.s. official with knowledge of the situation
<START> the two sides had been expected to meet at the korean peninsulas demilitarized zone and discuss the return of u.s. troop remains from the 1950-1953 war an arrangement the state department had announced after secretary of state mike pompeos visit to pyongyang friday and saturday
<START> on thursday , however , defense department and united nations command officials were left waiting in the dmzs joint security area
<START> the expected north korean officials never arrived , according to the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not permitted to talk publicly about the event
<START> we were ready , the official said.
<START> it just didnt happen
<START> they didnt show.
<START> a state department spokeswoman declined to comment but noted that pompeo said after his talks in pyongyang last week that the date for the meeting remained flexible
<START> just before departing pyongyang , pompeo said that the meeting was set for thursday but that it could move by one day or two.
<START> in a statement released to reporters on thursday , south koreas foreign ministry said that north korean military officials were seeking a meeting with their u.s. counterparts on sunday
<START> it was not clear why north korean officials did not attend the meeting thursday or whether they had confirmed their intention to
<START> ahead of the june 12 summit in singapore , north korean officials had failed to attend a planning meeting with their u.s. counterparts , causing tension between the negotiating partners
<START> the repatriation of the remains of u.s. soldiers from north korea has been a major issue between washington and pyongyang since the end of the korean war , when thousands of americans were left in korea either missing in action or as prisoners of war
<START> hundreds of remains have been repatriated since 1990 , but the process has been fraught with mistrust
<START> the transfer of remains between north korea and the united states has not taken place since 2005
<START> for the u.s. , a frustrating history of recovering remains in north korea
<START> president trump and north korean leader kim jong un had pledged to recover more american remains when they met in singapore to talk about denuclearization
<START> a statement signed by both leaders promised the immediate repatriation of those already identified.
<START> trump told a crowd of supporters a week later that the remains of 200 americans have been sent back.
<START> military officials later denied that but told reporters that they expected the remains to arrive within days and had made prearrangements for their arrival , such as storing caskets at the dmz
<START> since the summit in singapore , there has been increasing scrutiny of the agreement reached by trump and kim , with some experts suggesting that north korea did not intend to give up its nuclear weapons
<START> pompeo visited pyongyang last week in a bid to ease any misunderstandings between the two parties and find areas where they could make progress
<START> though the secretary of state described the talks as productive after they concluded , north koreas foreign ministry released a statement that criticized the regrettable u.s. negotiating style
<START> speaking in singapore on thursday , south korean president moon jae-in said that north koreas statement was a strategy that can often be seen in negotiations.
<START> moon also said that pompeos visit had shown that pyongyang and washington had the same view of denuclearization , according to his spokesman yoon young-chan
<START> the south korean government is constantly in contact with its u.s. counterpart about progress of the talks on war-remains repatriation , said roh kyu-deok , a spokesman for south koreas foreign ministry , but it declined to comment on details
<START> according to estimates from the pentagon , 7,700 u.s. troops are unaccounted for from the korean war
<START> of that number , 5,300 are believed to have been killed north of the 38th parallel , which marks the border between the koreas
