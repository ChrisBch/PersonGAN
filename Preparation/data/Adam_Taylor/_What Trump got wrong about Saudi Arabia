<START> this threat prompted criticism and ridicule from some experts , who argued that it overestimated saudi arabias economic clout
<START> but at least one key figure apparently took it seriously trump
<START> oil prices getting lower
<START> like a big tax cut for america and the world
<START> $ 54 , was just $ 82
<START> thank you to saudi arabia , but lets go lower
<START> the tweet was , at best , misleading
<START> it betrayed an apparent misunderstanding of the international oil market , with trump mixing and matching the u.s. oil price ( the west texas intermediate crude oil , or wti , price ) with the international price ( the brent price )
<START> in fact , saudi arabia is said to be considering cutting oil production next year in a bid to increase prices because of these factors
<START> but trump has long fixated on saudi arabias role in the oil markets , for better or worse
<START> just last week , he called on saudi arabia specifically to not cut oil production
<START> and , more generally , the u.s. president has inflated the economic value of saudi arabia to the united states several times in recent months
<START> hopefully , saudi arabia and opec will not be cutting oil production
<START> oil prices should be much lower based on supply
<START> on twitter , trump has a long-standing habit of talking about oil prices
<START> in 2011 , he suggested repeatedly that the united states should simply take iraqs oil
<START> he has also suggested that then-president barack obama made a deal with saudi arabia ahead of the 2012 election under which the kingdom increased oil production to keep prices low
<START> writing for the washington post last month , jeff colgan , an oil politics expert at brown university , argued that the way the oil market works had changed dramatically since 1973 , meaning that any future embargoes would have less impact
<START> the system has become more flexible , less reliant on long-term contracts , so it is easy for a consumer to get imports from another producer at short notice
<START> the united states also has been producing more oil itself and imports only a small amount of saudi oil
<START> wald wrote in the new york times , noting that aramco owns the largest refinery in the united states
<START> its likely that saudi arabias royals know this
<START> after aldakhils al-arabiya commentary was published , the saudi embassy in washington moved to distance the government from his stance
<START> a statement released on the same day by the official saudi press agency offered only a far more vague warning
<START> that statement said
<START> if saudi arabia has doubts about its economic worth to the united states , it should be thankful that trump apparently does not share them
<START> the u.s. leader has repeatedly inflated the value of arms deals with saudi arabia
<START> now , despite the global outrage over khashoggis killing , he continues to insist that saudi oil is vital to u.s. economic prosperity
