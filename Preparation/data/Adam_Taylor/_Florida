<START> for many outside observers , the u.s. midterm elections were a stark reminder of how different the american political system is from their own and how strange it can seem in comparison
<START> there was widespread confusion among non-americans , for example , about how democrats could lose senate seats though they won more total votes
<START> but if the vote showed off the quirks of the u.s. electoral system , the midterm elections also took a small but notable step in bringing the american system more closely into line with international norms
<START> and , perhaps somewhat surprisingly , that step came from florida
<START> on tuesday , a clear majority of floridians voted for a ballot initiative that could potentially restore voting rights to as many as 1.6 million ex-felons
<START> the proposal , listed as amendment 4 on the ballot , means that felons who have completed their full sentences would be given the vote again , with the exception of those convicted of murder or a sexual offense
<START> with almost all precincts reporting , the amendment passed with 64 percent in favor and 36 percent opposed
<START> but its only by comparing such a ban to the practices of other developed democracies around the world a sense emerges of how out of line this policy is with international norms
<START> there are certain countries that block those currently incarcerated from voting britain , for example though they largely have narrower restrictions than american states do
<START> whats really different about the system in the united states , however , is that these restrictions can apply even after people convicted of felonies have served their complete sentences
<START> in a state such as florida , that could have meant that those convicted of a felony would lose their voting rights even if they did not actually serve any jail time
<START> globally , that is unusual extremely unusual
<START> indeed , finding another country that allows a similar level of felon disenfranchisement is difficult
<START> armenia was once held up as the only country with restrictions that were similar , but the country amended its constitution in 2015 to allow more convicts to vote
<START> belgium and luxembourg automatically restrict the vote for some convicts , but this rule applies only to those given the highest sentences sentences that are handed out rarely when compared to the united states
<START> another important practical factor means that the u.s. laws on felons voting have more impact the united states has the highest incarceration rate of any developed nation
<START> in fact , its not even close
<START> the united states imprisons people at more than double the rate of the next closest country turkey
<START> in a populous state such as florida , this means that roughly 10 percent of the adult population is eventually barred from voting and a considerably higher proportion of the black adult population , given higher rates of incarceration among for african americans
<START> human rights watch wrote in a report released two decades ago
<START> it said the united states may have the worlds most restrictive criminal disenfranchisement laws.
<START> indeed , to find a comparable system , you can not just look over borders you need a history book
<START> in a 2004 paper , scholars jeff manza and chistropher uggen noted that the closest parallels to the u.s. system are to various pre-modern political regimes in ancient greece and rome , as well as medieval europe
<START> the american system may be a relic of another era , too
<START> the u.s. electoral system is decentralized by design , with the 14th amendment allowing each state to make its own rules about the right to vote
<START> but the success of amendment 4 , as well as separate reenfranchisement efforts in virginia , suggest that america might be able to iron out some of its election quirks and become more in line with other advanced democracies
