<START> changwon , south korea its been an excruciatingly hot summer in south korea , but those heading to the beach or the swimming pool to relax may find themselves burned by something else hidden spy cameras that film them in a state of undress
<START> in response to a growing outcry , teams organized by the police have sprung into action
<START> armed with infrared scanners that can spot a lens and devices that detect electrical charges , they spend hours hunting for cameras installed by peeping toms in changing rooms and public bathrooms
<START> we have to go out more often these days , said lee su-hyun , a police officer from changwon , capital of the coastal province of south gyeongsang
<START> during a recent stop at a local pool , the searchers waved the gizmos all over , from lockers to door frames to toilet bowls to shower heads to just about everywhere in between
<START> and yet the small team which included two schoolgirls and two housewives , along with a number of dedicated police officers didnt find a single camera during the inspection
<START> it wasnt a surprise
<START> these inspections in south gyeongsang have been going on since last september , but theyve never actually found a hidden camera
<START> in fact , though there are scores of such teams all over the country , police officials say none has ever found a camera but perhaps thats not the point
<START> south korea is in the midst of a battle against sexual harassment
<START> over the past year , the countrys metoo movement has taken down multiple high-profile men accused of harassment and assault , including an hee-jung , a rising star in the ruling democratic party
<START> although concerns about spy cams and illicit filming are far from new in south korea the activity was dubbed molka years ago the problem appears to be growing
<START> the number of suspected perpetrators identified by police rose from 1,354 in 2011 to 5,363 in 2017 more than 95 percent were men
<START> police say that the wider availability of smartphones , as well as the rise of social media , contributed to this increase
<START> indeed , despite the focus on hidden cameras , 90 percent of the crimes involved filming with regular smartphones , statistics show
<START> this summer , the backlash began
<START> police identified more than 26,000 victims of illicit filming between 2012 and 2016 , over 80 percent of them female
<START> but many never find out they are victims the real number would be 10 times higher than the police figure if the full extent were known , said oh yoon-sung , a criminology professor at soonchunhyang university
<START> the controversy even reached north korea.
<START> what is wrong with south korean men
<START> one north korean official asked visiting journalists in july , according to local media
<START> there are signs of concern at the top
<START> in may , south korean president moon jae-in lamented that spy cams had become a part of daily life and called for tougher punishments for those caught
<START> some women have taken matters into their own hands
<START> a small group uploaded videos apparently filmed in mens changing rooms a revenge that upended the gender dynamics of a largely male-perpetrated crime
<START> but much of the battle falls to authorities
<START> police officials say that over the past year they have undertaken a variety of new initiatives , from scouring the web to find illicitly recorded videos to keeping better tabs on sales of camera hardware
<START> but inspections of public spaces may be the most high-profile of the measures on offer whether cameras are found or not
<START> the team in south gyeongsang has inspected all sorts of places beaches , swimming pools , hotels , music venues , shopping centers and offices
<START> nowhere seemed to be off-limits.
<START> hospitals will ask us to do inspections , said lee , the police officer
<START> last month , the provinces police force received about $ 267,000 to focus on the problem , according to local police official chae kyoung-deok
<START> a lot of the work is educational , chae said
<START> at a police-run facility , visitors are shown objects that contain a hidden camera a baseball hat , a belt , a watch , a lighter , a usb stick , a necktie , a set of car keys
<START> a sign warns that a man could install a camera in his shoe
<START> there are even two hidden cameras in the room
<START> visitors are asked can you spot them
<START> on a recent monday morning in a suburb of seoul , police stood at the entrance to a public pool , handing out small red stickers for smartphones
<START> the idea was to remind people that surreptitious filming is a serious crime , said kim kyoung-woon , head of public relations for gyeonggi police
<START> he explained that the word spy cam has playful connotations in south korea the phrase molka comes from a popular 1990s television show that featured hidden-camera pranks so some dont realize how devastating such filming is for victims
<START> not everyone is sure these tactics make a difference
<START> kim young-mi , a spokeswoman at the korean women lawyers association , which conducts research on the issue for legislators , said that inspections have had little impact
<START> instead , kim said , harsher punishments are needed
<START> violators currently face up to five years in prison or a fine of up to about $ 9,000
<START> police statistics from the past five years showed that only 5.3 percent of those indicted on illegal filming charges went to prison , kim said
<START> but at least a few people seemed to be reassured by the sweeps
<START> hong ah-reum , a 25-year-old musician visiting the pool in gyeonggi , admitted she had been concerned about spy cams before her visit.
<START> maybe this will give me some reassurance , she said
<START> in south gyeongsang , others felt similarly.
<START> we didnt find anything today , said park jeong-yeon , a 16-year-old student who took part in the inspection.
<START> it made me a little less concerned.
<START> lee jung-hee , a 60-year-old housewife on the team , also said she was happy about not finding cameras
<START> but when she was asked what more south korea could do to change its attitudes , she took aim not at men but at their female victims
<START> she said with a laugh.
<START> that would lead to less sexual assault.
<START> amid awkward laughter around the table , chae , the police official , sighed if a man said this , itd be a huge controversy.
