<START> a tiny village in russia has said it will now not host the countrys first gay pride parade despite activists sharing a letter that appeared to show the local government had already agreed to it
<START> local authorities , who werent named , told the news wire tass on thursday
<START> the village of yablonevy , on the outskirts of novoulyanovsk , has a population of only around seven people
<START> however , it was brought to national attention on wednesday when moscow-based lgbt rights activist nikolai alexeyev wrote on the social network vk that the village had agreed to host a gay pride parade
<START> alexeyev wrote that novoulyanovsks mayor , svetlana kosarinova , agreed to host a parade in yablonevy after plans to host an event in another nearby village ( with a population of over 100 ) fell through
<START> the event would take place on aug. 26 , alexeyev wrote , adding that organizers should be careful not to go over the authorized number of attendees , which was 300
<START> it would be the coolest event in russian history , he said
<START> alexeyev wrote on vk , addressing kosarinova
<START> if the event were to go ahead , it would probably to be the first officially approved gay pride event in russia
<START> due to a 2013 law that banned expressions of gay propaganda and public speech or demonstrations supporting lgbt rights , local authorities have refused to give permission to lgbt groups to stage gay pride parades
<START> alexeyev later wrote on vk that two other lgbt events had been approved by kosarinova these events , which would be rallies rather than parades , would take place in novoulyanovsk , which has a population of over 16,000
<START> on thursday , however , local officials stepped in to say the gay pride parade would not take place
<START> it was not clear if the other lgbt events described by alexeyev would be canceled , too
<START> on vk , the activist said the dispute came down to a real split in the local government and argued that as city manager , denikayev did not have the authority to overrule the local mayor on planning public events
<START> speaking to russian news organization nsn , alexeyev said the entire way the event had been handled was a mockery that was designed to drive russias lgbt community into the ghetto
