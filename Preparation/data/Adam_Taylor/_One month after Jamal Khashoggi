<START> on oct. 2 , saudi journalist jamal khashoggi walked into his countrys consulate in istanbul for what he hoped would be a routine visit to get some documents
<START> instead , he was slain during that visit , and his killing sparked a global backlash against saudi arabia and its powerful crown prince , mohammed bin salman
<START> some of the details of what happened in the consulate have been confirmed , but a number of key questions in the case are still unanswered
<START> what happened to khashoggis body
<START> on wednesday , turkish investigators laid out the most detailed explanation yet of how khashoggi , a contributing columnist for the washington post and prominent critic of saudi leaders , was killed
<START> they said the journalist was strangled as soon as he entered the consulate , in line with a premeditated plan
<START> but khashoggis body still has not been found
<START> saudi officials previously said that the body was given to a local collaborator for disposal , but turkish investigators have suggested that person may not exist
<START> instead , they are considering whether khashoggis dismembered body was destroyed in acid , either in the consulate or the nearby residence of the saudi consul general
<START> khashoggis body was not in need of burying , a senior turkish official told the washington post
<START> the remains might give investigators a number of key clues , but they have a larger value for khashoggis friends and family.
<START> he did not have a funeral yet
<START> this is not acceptable in islamic rules , said his fiancee , hatice cengiz , to abc news , referring to the islamic practice of burying the dead soon after they expire
<START> how high up did the plot go
<START> it took the saudi government more than two weeks to admit that khashoggi had been killed , and even longer to say that the killing was deliberate
<START> it eventually arrested 18 saudi nationals and fired five top officials in response , but turkish investigators have said the kingdom has offered little practical help in uncovering exactly what happened.
<START> we did not get the impression that they were keen on genuinely cooperating with the investigation , one official told the post
<START> since the early days of khashoggis disappearance , there has been a deep suspicion that crown prince mohammed bin salman was involved in the plot
<START> in particular , the high-ranking nature of some of the suspects identified by turkey made it hard to imagine the plot was independent of saudi leadership
<START> its inconceivable that an operation using royal guards , other court officials and the consulate was not authorized by the crown prince , bruce riedel , a senior fellow at the brookings institution , said to the post
<START> u.s. intelligence intercepts suggested that the crown prince ordered an operation to lure khashoggi back to saudi arabia from his home in virginia
<START> he also described khashoggi as a dangerous islamist in phone calls with president trumps son-in-law , jared kushner , and national security adviser john bolton
<START> but the kingdom has repeatedly denied that mohammed had any involvement
<START> indeed , his father , king salman , appointed him to head a review of saudi intelligence services that was ordered in response to khashoggis killing
<START> what will the repercussions be
<START> saudi arabia has been a key ally of the united states and other western countries for decades
<START> as the second-most-senior royal in his country , mohammed bin salman initiated economic and social reforms that were greeted warmly by many foreign allies , especially trump
<START> his campaign of arrests and crackdowns on political rivals and activists was less commented-upon , and the brutal saudi war effort in yemen caused little trouble for riyadh
<START> but the killing of khashoggi has changed that
<START> even if the crown prince were not directly involved , the cruel nature of the crime and the incompetent attempts to cover it up suggest deep dysfunction
<START> saudi arabias reputation in the united states has been clearly damaged
<START> numerous american companies and government officials pulled out of a recent investment conference in riyadh
<START> u.s. lawmakers have suggested some form of targeted sanctions against saudi officials , and there is growing opposition in congress to u.s. support for the saudi intervention in yemen
<START> so far , though , there has been little practical change
<START> trump has been reticent to criticize the saudis and repeatedly suggested that he wouldnt consider canceling arms deals with the kingdom
<START> there is barely any more action in other western capitals
<START> germany is one of the only countries to make a major move so far , suspending arms sales to saudi arabia until further notice
<START> its also unclear whether there will be major changes in saudi arabia itself
<START> though riyadh is pledging its own investigation into the killing of khashoggi , thats unlikely to satisfy the countrys critics
<START> few saudi royals have the ability to push back against mohammed bin salman , and he appears to still have considerable support from his father and from the saudi public
