<START> president trump has canceled a trip to ireland , the irish government said tuesday , amid planned protests over his climate policies , international relations and treatment of immigrants , women and minorities
<START> the visit had been projected for november , when trump is scheduled to be in europe for a french commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of world war i
<START> said laura durkan , a spokeswoman for irish prime minister leo varadkar.
<START> the u.s. side has cited scheduling reasons.
<START> as details are confirmed we will let you know.
<START> the cancellation was first reported by the irish independent newspaper , which noted that political parties , including labour and the greens , had planned to protest the nov. 12 visit to dublin
<START> other protests were planned in dublin and other irish cities
<START> trump had planned to spend one day in the irish capital before traveling to a trump golf course in doonbeg , in county clare
<START> protests planned for trump visit to ireland
<START> the white house had announced the visit on aug. 31 , taking varadkar by surprise
<START> the tweet included a photo with a caption that said , the invitation to trump is unnecessary , unwelcome & unwise.
<START> labour leader brendan howlin tweeted that trump has been no friend of democracy or human rights.
<START> on tuesday , labour tweeted a statement from irish sen. aodhan o riordain , the partys education spokesman , welcoming the cancellation
<START> such strong popular opposition to a u.s. leader is unusual for ireland , where a u.s. presidential visit is usually a chance to happily mark the close ties between ireland and the united states , sometimes over a guinness , tonge said
<START> when president barack obama visited in 2011 , he went to the small village where his maternal great-great-great grandfather was raised and joked that he was searching for the missing apostrophe in his kenyan surname
<START> but the normalities are very , very different under a trump regime , he said , noting that the view of trump in ireland was predominantly negative.
<START> meanwhile , russian media reported tuesday that trump may meet with russian president vladimir putin during the same european trip that had included the planned ireland visit
<START> the meeting would apparently be on the sidelines of the world war i armistice day ceremonies on nov. 11
<START> the meeting would be a follow-up to the stand-alone summit between trump and putin in july
<START> that summit , in helsinki , led to widespread criticism that trump was deferential to putin and did not challenge him about russian interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election
