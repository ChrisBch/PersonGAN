<START> the saudi government has come under intense criticism for the killing of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi , and some saudi social media users have come up with a way to fight back boycotting amazon.com
<START> over the past few days , saudi twitter users have used hashtags such as boycottamazon and ____ to encourage their compatriots and allies to stop using amazon as well as souq , an online retailer bought by amazon last year
<START> according to bloomberg news , the calls for a boycott topped twitters trending topics in saudi arabia for several hours sunday
<START> the boycott effort appears to be linked to the washington posts coverage of the killing of khashoggi , who was a contributing columnist to the newspaper
<START> post owner jeffrey p. bezos is the founder and chief executive of amazon
<START> some of the tweets justified a boycott by saying that saudi arabia and its crown prince , mohammed bin salman , are under attack
<START> i was premier customer as i ordered weekly from amazon , but now i delete my account until they stop attacking my government .____
<START> im going to cancel my amazon subscription
<START> khashoggi , once a riyadh insider , had become a trenchant critic of the crown princes reforms in recent years and lived in virginia in self-imposed exile
<START> he was killed oct. 2 after visiting the saudi consulate in istanbul to get a document he needed for his planned marriage
<START> the journalists disappearance and the kingdoms belated admission that he was killed at the consulate caused a global publicity crisis for saudi arabia and mohammed
<START> riyadh has repeatedly denied that the crown prince had any knowledge of a plan to kill khashoggi , but many observers find that claim unlikely
<START> still , many saudis still support mohammed what happened to khashoggi is terrible and goes against islam , one saudi citizen in the town of ad dilam said to the post last week
<START> our crown prince did not do that
<START> we trust him , and we feel the changes he has made for us
<START> its unclear how much the amazon boycott drive represents popular opinion in saudi arabia
<START> the country has one of the most active twitter user bases in the arab world , but analysts say the use of pro-government bots is widespread and often designed to get certain messages onto trending lists
<START> many of the tweets calling for a boycott of amazon used similar if not identical language , suggesting some degree of coordination
<START> some users also used the hashtags to criticize the call for boycott , saying it would not make a difference
<START> ____ who ever created this hashtag clearly knows nothin about world economics , you really think not buying headphone with ur 20 riyals would bring jeff bezos to his knees
<START> amazon had been looking toward saudi arabia as an area of potential growth
<START> the retailer began hiring for new positions in riyadh this year after bezos met with mohammed in seattle in march
<START> it also used souq , which is widely used in saudi arabia , to offer access to amazon
<START> a representative from amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the post
