<START> a new poll shows that in several countries around the world , large majorities of people believe it is most likely that robots will be doing much of the work done by humans within 50 years
<START> the effects of this technological leap are not viewed optimistically by most , however
<START> instead , people largely say they think humans will struggle to find meaningful work and inequality will rise , the research found
<START> the polling was conducted earlier this year by the pew research center in greece , japan , canada , argentina , poland , brazil , south africa , italy and hungary
<START> pew also compared the responses in those countries to polling done in the united states in 2015 that asked about automation
<START> in all of the countries surveyed , more than two-thirds were found to believe that automation meant that robots would take over work done by humans within a half-century
<START> in greece , 52 percent said this would definitely happen , while 39 percent said this would probably happen
<START> respondents were also asked about how automation would affect their countries
<START> in each case , a large majority said it would make it difficult for ordinary people to find jobs , while a majority in most countries said jobs lost to automation would not be replaced by new , better paying jobs.
<START> there were only three countries in which a majority thought automation would make the countries economies more efficient japan ( 74 percent ) , poland ( 52 percent ) and hungary ( 52 percent )
<START> in every country surveyed , a significant majority believed automation would worsen the existing inequality between the rich and the poor
<START> despite these concerns , the general sense is that automation is inevitable
<START> it is already happening in many countries , as chinese e-commerce giant jd.com employs just four people at one facility where 200,000 boxes are packed every day , with the rest done by robots
<START> pews report noted manufacturing robots could cost as little as $ 4 an hour to operate , compared with an average hourly cost of $ 36 for a human worker in the united states
<START> so how should workers prepare for this future
<START> with the exception of the united states in 2015 , a majority in each country said the government had a responsibility to help workers acquire the right skills to adapt
<START> many surveyed also said schools , employers and the individuals themselves have a responsibility to prepare for the changes though japan was an outlier , with respondents clearly viewing the government as obliged to assume more of the responsibility
