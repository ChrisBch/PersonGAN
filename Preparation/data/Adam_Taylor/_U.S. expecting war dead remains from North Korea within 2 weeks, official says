<START> seoul the u.s. military is expecting to repatriate from north korea the remains of as many as 55 service members who were killed during the korean war , a u.s. official said tuesday
<START> the repatriations would probably take place next week or the week after , the official said
<START> it would be the first time that remains believed to be those of u.s. troops have been directly returned by north korean officials in 13 years
<START> the official , who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plan and spoke on the condition of anonymity , cautioned that the timing and the number of remains could still change
<START> citing practical difficulties , the official said that 55 was a ballpark figure and that further testing by the defense pow/mia accounting agency would be required to confirm the number
<START> the stars and stripes newspaper had first reported tuesday that a u.s. delegation had agreed to travel to north korea and retrieve the remains , citing a u.s. official
<START> the u.s. team would then fly out with the remains on july 27 , either to osan air base in south korea or to hawaii
<START> july 27 is the 65th anniversary of the signing of an armistice that ended the korean war , lending the date symbolic importance in u.s.-north korea relations
<START> u.s. military data suggests that 7,700 troops remain unaccounted for from the 1950-1953 conflict
<START> the united states and north korea have repatriated hundreds of remains since the 1990s , but the process has been fraught with difficulties and mistrust
<START> the transfers of remains were halted during the administration of president george w. bush in 2005 , following diplomatic tension between the nations
<START> after their june 12 summit in singapore , president trump and north korean leader kim jong un had agreed to restart the repatriation process , and both signed a statement promising the immediate repatriation of those already identified.
<START> on june 21 , trump told a crowd of supporters that 200 americans remains have been sent back.
<START> military officials later denied this but said that prearrangements for the transfer had been made including the storage of 100 caskets at the demilitarized zone
<START> on thursday , members of a u.s. military delegation expecting to discuss the repatriation process were left waiting at the korean peninsulas demilitarized zone when their north korean counterparts did not arrive for a meeting
<START> the state department later said the north korean side had been in contact at midday to cancel that meeting thursday and had suggested rescheduling to sunday
<START> u.s. military officials met with their north korean counterparts sunday to continue discussions about repatriation
<START> the u.s. side was led by maj. gen. michael a. minihan , chief of staff for the u.n. command
<START> the meeting was the first between a u.s. and north korean general since march 2009
<START> in a statement , secretary of state mike pompeo said the talks were productive and cooperative and resulted in firm commitments.
<START> the meeting was followed up by another working-level meeting monday to work out the next steps
<START> the united states and north korea have also agreed to restart efforts to search for the remains of other americans in the northern part of the peninsula , according to the state department
