<START> a skit at state broadcaster cctv 's annual lunar new year gala recently caused headlines around the world after it featured a chinese actress in blackface with huge prosthetic buttocks portraying an african woman , along with tribal dancers and monkeys
<START> as one observer put it , the skit was cringe-worthy at best , completely racist at worst.
<START> this week , beijing responded by saying that the sketch was not racist
<START> instead , the foreign ministry said , the controversy over the skit in western media was a futile attempt to undermine china 's relationship with africa
<START> foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang was asked about the segment at a news conference thursday the first to be held since the end of the week-long new year holiday
<START> geng initially questioned whether the sketch was really a diplomatic issue and said the reporter posing the question should be asking the gala organizers instead
<START> the spokesman added that he had seen that the skit had been covered widely in the western media
<START> he said that if people tried to exaggerate the incident to undermine relations between china and africa , it would be a doomed , futile effort.
<START> the cctv new years gala draws massive viewership
<START> with an estimated 700 million viewers , the show 's audience is about seven times as large as the most recent super bowl , making it probably the world 's most-watched television show
<START> the controversial segment of the show was designed to celebrate the links between china and africa , including a new chinese-built high-speed rail line in kenya
<START> the skit began with a dance routine featuring the shakira song waka waka ( this time for africa )
<START> an african woman then asks the show 's chinese host to pretend to be her fiance so her mother does not set her up on a blind date and she can instead move to china
<START> her mother , played by chinese actress lou naiming wearing blackface , then enters the scene , and the african woman and the host pretend to be a couple
<START> the ruse is soon ruined after the host 's chinese wife makes an entrance
<START> however , the african mother says she can not be angry over the subterfuge because of the strong bond between the people of china and africa.
<START> i love chinese people
<START> i love china , the mother says
<START> zhou hengshan , 80 , told an associated press reporter in beijing last week
<START> however , some chinese social media users were embarrassed by the segment and worried about the damage it would do to china 's image abroad.
<START> this is plain racism , the foreign media are going to explode , wrote one user on weibo , according to the blog what 's on weibo
<START> china has made billions of dollars worth of investments in sub-saharan africa in recent years , and polls have shown that , in general , africans welcome the chinese investment
<START> however , there are often points of tension , including concerns surrounding the continent 's natural resources and chinese aid propping up bad governments
<START> chinese television has faced accusations of racism before
<START> in an advertisement aired in 2016 , a black man is shown turning into a chinese man after a chinese woman washes him with the laundry detergent being advertised
<START> in that case , it was later reported that the company behind the advertisement had apologized
