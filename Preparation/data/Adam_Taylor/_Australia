<START> the unusual public split between deputy prime minister barnaby joyce and prime minister malcolm turnbull could potentially threaten the coalition government , which is led by the liberal party and has a junior partner in the national party
<START> even with the coalition , the government has a fragile majority of just one seat
<START> turnbull told reporters
<START> joyce , leader of the national party , was well-known in australia as a staunch defender of family values and a vocal critic of same-sex marriage
<START> however , it was revealed last week that the 50-year-old joyce was expecting a baby with the 33-year-old former staffer with whom he is now living

<START> deputy prime minister barnaby joyce expecting baby in april with former staffer
<START> though turnbull had initially stood by his deputy , his stance changed this week
<START> at a news conference thursday , turnbull said that in light of the affair , he would amend the ministerial code of conduct to restrict sexual relationships between ministers and their staff
<START> the move came a week after the u.s. house of representatives similarly voted to bar sexual relationships between lawmakers and their staff members , after a heated debate about how congress should handle such allegations involving lawmakers
<START> some australian analysts noted that both the initial reporting of joyce 's affair and turnbull 's reaction to it showed that politicians private lives , long off-limits for reporters , were now under intense scrutiny.
<START> australian politics are about to get more american , australian journalist and radio host richard glover wrote for the washington post this week , adding that in the case of joyce 's affair , most in the country welcomed the change
<START> turnbull said friday that joyce would no longer take over as head of government when the prime minister visits the united states next week , instead telling reporters friday that joyce has taken some leave , and he is considering his position.
<START> his comments were widely interpreted in australia as a request for his deputy to step down
<START> joyce has so far refused to consider that move , however instead , he has fired back
<START> speaking to journalists in canberra on friday , the deputy prime minister said that turnbull 's comments had caused further harm in many instances
<START> for many australians , the issue is less about sex between a minister and his subordinate than the allegations of financial corruption that go with it
<START> joyce 's former staffer and mistress , vikki campion , was shuttled around different jobs in parliament after the affair began
<START> it later emerged that the couple were living rent-free in an apartment owned by a wealthy businessman , which some critics called a breach of ministerial standards
<START> the scandal exposed deep rifts in the long-standing conservative coalition between the liberal and national parties
<START> the former is one of australia 's two major parties , and generally promotes a modern , urban form of economic liberalism that turnbull a sydney-born , oxford-educated former banker and lawyer exemplifies
<START> however , for almost a century , the liberal party has formed coalitions with the national party and its predecessors
<START> politicians like joyce , who often wears a bush hat in public appearances and who once made headlines by calling for johnny depp 's dogs to be euthanized , have helped find rural supporters for the conservative government
<START> australia analysts have noted that though turnbull can not fire joyce , he could ask the national party to sack him something it has already indicated it would not do
<START> opposition leader bill shorten told reporters friday that neither man was fit for his job
