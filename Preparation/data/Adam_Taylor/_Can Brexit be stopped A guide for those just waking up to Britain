<START> confused about brexit
<START> youre not alone
<START> britains path to leaving the european union has gotten rather complicated and long , full of forks in the road , double-backs and more than a few dead ends
<START> even seasoned brexit-watchers have been left at a loss for words
<START> but have no fear
<START> below , weve answered some of the most pressing questions about brexit
<START> q what is brexit
<START> a british prime minister theresa may has said brexit means brexit.
<START> but what that actually means is that britain is going to leave the european union
<START> this would mean giving up the automatic free movement and free trade rights that come with e.u
<START> q why is britain leaving the e. u.
<START> a thats a big debate
<START> but basically , its because britain voted in a referendum on june 23 , 2016
<START> those voters who wanted out of the e.u
<START> and to take back control of britains laws and borders won 52-48
<START> q so britain is definitely leaving the e. u.
<START> a probably
<START> q probably
<START> a well , first britain and the e.u
<START> need to agree on terms for how it will leave
<START> then britains parliament will need to agree , too
<START> also , some brits want a peoples vote
<START> q that sounds like a lot
<START> how long do they have to sort it out
<START> a technically the ultimate deadline is march 29 , unless there is an extension agreed upon
<START> q oh
<START> so hows that all going
<START> a well , its taken a while
<START> but may won approval for her withdrawal agreement from her divided cabinet on nov. 14
<START> q wait , this is a withdrawal agreement
<START> is that different from a trade deal
<START> a yes
<START> the withdrawal agreement outlines how britain will leave the e.u
<START> things like a timetable for a transition period , what happens to e.u
<START> nationals living in britain and the amount of money that britain has to pay the e.u
<START> a trade deal would establish an independent britains future economic relationship with the e.u
<START> q okay , but this withdrawal agreement has the full support of britain
<START> a not by a long way
<START> in fact , there are plenty of people within mays own ruling conservative party who want to remain in the e.u
<START> and many hardcore brexiteers who dont support her plan for the opposite reason
<START> q huh
<START> i thought they wanted brexit
<START> a they do , but they feel like may has made too many concessions to europe with this deal
<START> q what sort of brexit did they want
<START> a many brexiteers want an agreement that keeps the economic benefits of the e.u
<START> but ends free movement , takes away brussels control over britains trade laws and avoids a hard irish border ( more on all this later )
<START> q who are they , by the way
<START> a the most notable ones are boris johnson , mays former foreign secretary , and jacob rees mogg , another member of the conservatives
<START> but there are many others
<START> q what is the worst-case scenario for brexit
<START> a probably the doomsday scenario of a no-deal brexit , whereby britain has to revert to world trade organization trade rules at its borders because it cant reach an agreement with europe
<START> q why would that be so bad
<START> a it would likely cause major changes to british trade , resulting in serious disruption to almost every aspect of britains business
<START> an international monetary fund projection this week warned that up to eight percent of britains gross domestic product could be lost
<START> q yikes
<START> are people prepared for that
<START> a cadburys started stockpiling the ingredients for chocolate
<START> so maybe that part of british life will be okay
<START> q how likely is this
<START> a its definitely possible
<START> one study that came out before may made her deal estimated there were five possible scenarios for brexit
<START> all but one resulted in no deal
<START> q so is this likelihood lesser now
<START> a hardly
<START> there has been a string of resignations from mays government , casting doubt upon her ability to get her withdrawal agreement through parliament
<START> q does the e.u
<START> want a no-deal for britain
<START> a european leaders have voiced real concerns about a no-deal brexit it could potentially disrupt their own agreements , too , remember
<START> but the e.u
<START> is also worried about other countries trying to leave , so it is driving a hard bargain with britain and offering few concessions
<START> q does britains opposition party oppose brexit
<START> a labour is split on brexit generally but is likely to oppose mays deal for political reasons
<START> however , it is unlikely to stop brexit anytime soon its leader , jeremy corbyn , said recently that brexit could not be stopped
<START> q does anyone want to stop brexit
<START> a yes
<START> lots of politicians in both the labour and conservative parties do want to stop it , while smaller parties , such as the liberal democrats , actively campaign against it
<START> q could brexit be stopped
<START> a theoretically , yes a point may herself recently alluded to for the first time after reaching her draft agreement
<START> but it would be a risky move politically
<START> q couldnt they just have a second referendum
<START> a the idea of a second referendum ( a peoples vote ) on the final terms has considerable support among the public , but politicians are hesitant , as it could unleash further political chaos
<START> q how would britain vote if that happened
<START> a hard to say , but many polls do suggest that british voters have grown more opposed to brexit over the past two years
<START> q okay , lets back up
<START> what is e.u
<START> freedom of movement , and why didnt brexiteers like it
<START> a citizens of the european union are entitled to move around the nation states
<START> for many in the pro-brexit camp , immigration was a major issue with the rest of europe
<START> q and what is the customs union
<START> and the single market
<START> a the e.u
<START> customs union means it negotiates trade laws as a bloc , and the single market means that europe has no trade barriers within it
<START> pro-brexit voices hope that by leaving europe , britain can negotiate its own , better trade deals
<START> q what is the big issue with the irish border
<START> a if britain were to leave the customs union and the single market , there could be a hard border between northern ireland and ireland , where border checks are now minimal
<START> q why is that a problem
<START> a it could jeopardize the 1998 good friday agreement and , with it , the northern ireland peace process
<START> it also would likely have a significant impact on trade
<START> plus , may needs to get her political partner in northern ireland ( the democratic unionist party ) and the irish government on her side
<START> q so does mays deal solve all this
<START> a kind of
<START> but also , not really
<START> q how so
<START> a in the brexit withdrawal agreements 585 pages , the most notable outcome was the creation of a transition period , which would essentially keep britain in the blocs customs union until 2020 , and possibly past then
<START> q and that solves the irish border problem
<START> a no , but it appears to provide a backstop for sorting it out in the future
<START> q and freedom of movement
<START> a e.u
<START> nationals living in britain and brits living in e.u
<START> states will retain their rights , but they will have to formally apply for status to remain in the country
<START> q this doesnt sound like it would please everyone
<START> a it doesnt
<START> as we noted before , both pro-brexit and anti-brexit camps have voiced opposition
<START> q what happens next
<START> a the plan needs to go to brussels , where european leaders will debate and vote on nov. 25
<START> thats if may can keep her job , however
<START> q wait , may could lose her job
<START> a yes
<START> she may be forced from office with a no-confidence vote , or she might even resign
<START> its unclear who would replace her , though , or whether theyd do a better job
<START> q i have more questions that were not answered here
<START> a we all do
