<START> one of the most complicated episodes in syria 's ever-twisting war took place the night of feb. 7
<START> in that incident , u.s. troops and their syrian allies near the town of deir al-zour were attacked by hundreds of fighters loyal to the syrian regime
<START> the americans responded with a devastating counterattack that the united states said left about 100 dead
<START> soon , the situation was complicated further by reports that russian mercenaries had taken part in the attack and were among the dead making it the deadliest u.s.-russia clash since the cold war
<START> worse still , u.s. intelligence reports suggest that prigozhin was in touch with both the kremlin and syrian officials shortly before and after the attack , the washington post reported thursday
<START> the situation raises big questions about what role a russian mercenary firm or rather a pseudo-mercenary firm , according to russian military expert mark galeotti was playing in the syrian war
<START> when was wagner created
<START> wagner first gained attention for its operations in 2014 in ukraine , where mercenaries with the group mostly military veterans and ultranationalists were reported to be fighting alongside russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country
<START> the group was believed to have been led by dmitry utkin , who until 2013 had served in russia 's foreign military intelligence agency , the gru
<START> after leaving official military service , utkin is reported to have worked with the private security firm moran security group and the slavonic corps , a group of russian mercenaries sent to syria in 2013 with notoriously disastrous consequences
<START> according to the russian investigative outlet fontanka , wagners founder is a nazi sympathizer
<START> russian media reported that utkin named his group after richard wagner , the german composer whose works were appropriated by hitler
<START> he was later sanctioned by the u.s. treasury department for his involvement in ukraine
<START> subsequent reports indicated that wagner mercenaries may be deployed to sudan and the central african republic
<START> what is prigozhin 's relationship to wagner
<START> prigozhin is a russian oligarch who first became famous as a restaurateur his nickname is putin 's chef.
<START> he has had a remarkable life , taking an unlikely path from prison , where he served nine years on charges related to robbery and prostitution , to becoming a kremlin-linked entrepreneur
<START> he now has a reputation as a man willing to do russian president vladimir putin 's dirty work
<START> last week , he was included in a u.s. indictment that focused on the internet research agency , a st. petersburg-based firm that was alleged to have used social media to interfere in u.s. politics , including the 2016 presidential election
<START> the indictment says that prigozhin and his catering company , concord , spent significant funds on the venture and that prigozhin attended regular briefings on its work
<START> u.s. intelligence sources think that prigozhin almost certainly controls the wagner mercenaries fighting in syria
<START> notably , russian business outlet rbc reported last year that utkin appeared to have been listed as the general director of one of prigozhin 's catering businesses
<START> what role does wagner play in syria
<START> at first , wagner mercenaries were believed to be involved mostly with security for russian bases and other military facilities in syria
<START> however , as the war has dragged on , they have taken a more active stance and played a role in the fighting to reclaim the ancient city of palmyra in 2016 and 2017
<START> at least part of the group 's efforts may be purely commercial , too
<START> the associated press reported late last year that a syrian state oil company had offered a wagner front company a cut of profits from refineries liberated from the islamic state
<START> the number of wagner troops in the country has been as high as 3,000 , according to fontanka , which also says that around 73 have died in syria a conservative estimate according to other monitoring groups
<START> the russian government has acknowledged that several dozen russians were killed or wounded in the u.s. counterattack feb. 7 and 8
<START> so is this a private group or is it part of the russian military
<START> he explained via email
<START> indeed , although putin has expressed support for the idea of private defense companies , such ventures remain illegal under russian law
<START> when the slavonic corps returned to russia from syria in 2013 , some members were reportedly arrested
<START> but private military companies can serve a key purpose for russia
<START> the kremlin is keen to avoid official casualties in syria like those that were sustained during bloody and unpopular wars , notably in chechnya and the soviet invasion and occupation of afghanistan
<START> and as moscow saw during the conflict in ukraine , private military contractors can give it a degree of plausible deniability when it comes to controversial international conflicts
<START> the russian government has quietly embraced its mercenary allies at times utkin was photographed receiving an award from putin in 2016
<START> according to u.s. intelligence intercepts , prigozhin told syrian officials he had secured permission from an unspecified russian minister for the feb. 7 attack
<START> however , it is n't clear to what extent moscow directs wagner 's work or whether it always condones it
<START> yury barmin , an expert on russian foreign policy in the middle east , suggested on twitter that the lack of russian military support for wagner during the u.s. counterattack could suggest a split between the russian defense ministry and the mercenary group
<START> what happens to it now
<START> alexey khlebnikov , a political risk consultant and a middle east expert at the russian international affairs council , said wagner represents a double-edged sword for moscow although it is of clear tactical use , it also puts russia at risk
<START> one big problem is that despite attempts to keep wagner 's activities in syria quiet , details have trickled out in embarrassing ways
<START> last year , for example , the islamic state released a video that claimed to show captured russian citizens these russians were later linked to wagner
<START> the death of russian mercenaries at the hands of the united states has provoked further grief , as well as anger that the russian government does not acknowledge their sacrifice
<START> this reaction may undermine public support for the intervention in syria
<START> one poll conducted last year found that almost half of russians thought that their country should end its operations in syria , while 32 percent thought it was likely to turn into a new afghanistan for russia
<START> that undermine russia , he added
