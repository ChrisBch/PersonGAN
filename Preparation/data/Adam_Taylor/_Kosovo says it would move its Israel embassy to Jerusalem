<START> president trump moved the u.s. embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem in may , but other countries have not followed suit
<START> only two guatemala and paraguay have made the move themselves the latter also moved its embassy back to tel aviv earlier this month
<START> this week , another country signaled that it hoped to open an embassy in jerusalem , and surprisingly , its a muslim-majority nation
<START> but theres an unexpected catch israel doesnt recognize this nation
<START> thaci explained during an interview with vizion plus in albania
<START> a former paramilitary leader , thaci has been president of kosovo since 2016
<START> before that , he had been prime minister , having unilaterally declared the countrys independence from serbia in 2008
<START> the small balkan country was at the center of tension between ethnic albanians and serbs in the 1990s after the collapse of yugoslavia , culminating in the kosovo war in 1998 and 1999 , which saw kosovo albanians supported by nato allies
<START> the nation , which has a population of fewer than 2 million , is recognized by a majority of the united nations member states
<START> however , serbia does not recognize it as an independent state , and many other nations who have their own fears of separatist movements have also refused to recognize it , including major powers such as china , russia and india
<START> israels decision to not recognize kosovo was based in part upon its own fears that palestinians would use kosovo to justify their own independence , the jerusalem post reported at the time
<START> however , politicians in both countries have spoken warmly of their ties and hopes for a new relationship in the future
<START> trumps decision to move the u.s. embassy to jerusalem was controversial , as the city is disputed and divided , with palestinians hoping that east jerusalem will be the capital city of a future state
<START> however , the palestine liberation organization does not support kosovos independence either , in part because of concerns over the pro-u.s. public sentiment in kosovo that has dominated since the 1990s
<START> notably , the big countries that dont recognize kosovo often recognize the palestinian territories as a state
<START> though many in kosovo supported hillary clinton in the 2016 u.s. election because of the role her husband , former president bill clinton , played in the kosovo war , thaci has sought to develop close ties to trump
<START> on the sidelines of last years u.n. general assembly in new york , thaci met with the american leader and later told reporters that trump has a clear vision for kosovo.
<START> in january , thaci told reporters that if it could have , kosovo would have supported the united states in a vote on a nonbinding resolution at the u.n. general assembly that condemned trumps decision to move the embassy
<START> kosovo is not a u.n. member , and in the end , 128 countries voted for the resolution
