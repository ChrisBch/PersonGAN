<START> jacob zuma 's resignation as south africa 's president was n't exactly a surprise
<START> the bigger question may be why did it take so long
<START> during his long political career , zuma has been roiled by corruption scandals , including
<START> the allegations went much further than corruption
<START> in 2006 , he was put on trial in the alleged rape of a 31-year-old hiv-positive daughter of a friend
<START> while defending his innocence , saying the sex was consensual , he left health experts aghast when he said that the intercourse was unprotected but that he had showered afterward to avoid hiv transmission
<START> though he was acquitted , many still have their doubts including south africa 's new president , cyril ramaphosa , who last year said he believed zuma 's late accuser
<START> more broadly , zuma had presided over an era of increasing economic inequality , with high unemployment and extreme poverty in the country and international rating agencies downgrading south africa 's credit rating to junk
<START> and yet , zuma survived multiple attempts to force him out from office , even when his approval rating dropped to 20 percent
<START> how was an unpopular politician accused of rape and corruption able to survive in south africa for so long
<START> there are many reasons , but one factor is south africa 's unusual electoral system and the party dynamics that interplay with it
<START> how south africa 's political system kept zuma in office
<START> south africa 's current constitution was drawn up in 1994 as the country emerged from years of white dominance for its first nonracial elections
<START> after it was implemented in 1997 , the constitution changed the way south africans voted for their politicians in a significant way
<START> in the apartheid era , the country 's national assembly used a first-past-the-post system , as used in the british parliament voters in different geographical constituencies would vote for different candidates , and whichever candidate had the most votes would represent that constituency
<START> such systems tend to lead to two dominant parties , and it often results in parties gaining a majority of seats in a parliament without a majority of votes
<START> some critics have noted that in south africa , it may have helped the pro-apartheid national party
<START> in 1994 , politicians opted to change to a closed-party-list proportional system
<START> under this system , south africans would vote for a party rather than a candidate then seats in parliament would be apportioned , using a private list drawn up by each party , to reflect the proportion of popular vote the parties won
<START> in a quirk , the head of state , the president , would not be voted for directly but instead would be a member selected by parliament
<START> as such , he or she would be head of state and head of government
<START> it 's an unusual system , but it has its strengths
<START> the parliament is a good representation of the politics of the country
<START> the president has significant powers of appointment and can veto bills , but the national assembly can act as a check on his power
<START> unlike in the united states , for example , south africa 's legislature can remove the president from office for any reason it sees fit
<START> what you might expect from such a system is political instability proportional representation systems can often result in a fractured political landscape , with smaller parties forming coalition governments for legislative majorities a situation you often see in european nations such as the netherlands
<START> with the south african president reliant on parliament 's approval , the government would seem to be even more unstable
<START> but in south africa , things did n't work out that way
<START> the african national congress , the famous liberation movement and party of nelson mandela , has proved remarkably popular in the post-apartheid era
<START> since 1994 , the party has consistently won more than 60 percent of the popular vote and been rewarded with overwhelming majorities in the legislature
<START> what zuma 's ouster means for south african politics
<START> zuma was long a controversial president , and there have been plenty of attempts from the national assembly to oust him in recent years , eight in total
<START> the problem was that those efforts came from opposition parties few anc members would break party ranks to go against zuma
<START> the situation highlighted the fact that south african politicians were more beholden to their parties than voters , because of the closed-party-list system
<START> february noted , pointing out that anc politicians who called for zuma 's removal , such as makhosi khoza , would end up pushed out
<START> eventually , though , zuma 's antics caught up with the party , leading it to shocking losses in anc strongholds during municipal elections in 2016
<START> but with national elections coming next year and zuma 's constitutionally restricted two terms in office coming to a close , many in the party viewed him as too big a liability for the anc 's future and the move to replace him gained traction
<START> when zuma tried to install his ex-wife , nkosazana dlamini-zuma , as anc leader in december , she lost to ramaphosa , a wealthy businessman who had campaigned against corruption
<START> zuma 's effort to extend his time in office by proxy was the final straw for many anc members
<START> but even after the anc formally recalled him on tuesday , he refused to step down
<START> zuma finally resigned as president wednesday , after facing a humiliating no-confidence vote in the national assembly
<START> some analysts are now calling for an open-party-list system , in which voters could at least see the parties national assembly candidates , if not possibly rank them in order of preference
<START> others have called for the anc to overhaul its internal electoral systems , given how much sway the party still has over top appointments
<START> but does zuma 's ouster after years of scandals mean south africa will get real electoral reform
<START> after almost a decade of zuma in power , south africa is facing numerous crises that need more immediate attention
<START> ( after years of drought , cape town , south africa 's coastal metropolis of 4 million , is about to run out of water )
