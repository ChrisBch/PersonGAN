<START> seoul to south korean conservatives , president trump looked like an ally
<START> his tough talk on north korea , his pro-military views and his disdain for liberal politics all of it fit neatly with the ideas that had ruled the right here for decades
<START> but almost 18 months into his presidency , many acknowledge that trump has been a disaster for south koreas beleaguered conservative movement
<START> south korea struggles to digest strange new reality of kim jong un bonding with white house
<START> south koreas rightists are in the midst of a full-blown identity crisis
<START> and the effect can be seen in electoral votes and opinion polls
<START> in regional elections on june 13 , the liberty korea party suffered a humiliating defeat , garnering just two of 17 major mayoral and gubernatorial seats and only a little more than half the votes that the governing minjoo party received
<START> liberal candidate moon jae-in beat hong in last years presidential election by more than 17 percentage points
<START> as president , moon now enjoys sky-high approval ratings of around 70 percent , suggesting that many former supporters of conservative parties are backing him
<START> with parliamentary elections due in 2020 , liberty korea is in the process of reimagining south korean conservatism in a desperate bid to retain political relevance
<START> for kang yeon-jae , a losing candidate for the party in junes regional elections , the outlook for the right is as bad as it gets
<START> its not going to survive unless it changes completely , kang said
<START> among older right-wingers like hong , the despair is palpable
<START> during a recent meeting at a japanese restaurant in seouls upmarket jamsil neighborhood , hong wore a red blazer and shirt a nod to the color of south korean conservatism
<START> but although his brash tone had once earned him comparisons to trump , hong now distances himself
<START> he didnt stick to his words.
<START> as pompeo visits pyongyang , south korea quietly watches and worries
<START> the rot in south koreas conservative movement set in before trumps detente with north korea
<START> it accelerated with a string of scandals surrounding conservative former president park geun-hye that left the movement deeply divided
<START> the daughter of former president park chung-hee , an autocrat who presided over an economic boom only to be assassinated in 1979 , the younger park made history as south koreas first female president in 2013
<START> but allegations of cronyism soon saw her domestic support drop off dramatically
<START> by november 2016 , her approval rating was just 4 percent , the lowest ever recorded in south korea
<START> in a subsequent impeachment vote , almost half the lawmakers from her own party voted against her
<START> park was removed from office last year and in april was sentenced to 24 years in prison
<START> the impeachment caused a schism among conservatives
<START> some were aghast at what their leader had done and distanced themselves from her saenuri party , later rebranded as liberty korea
<START> said lee jun-seok , a harvard-educated conservative who left saenuri over the scandal
<START> yet support for park persists , most fervently in the korean patriots party , which holds frequent rallies to protest her imprisonment
<START> this group had once seen trump as its savior supporters waved american and israeli flags and called on him to not only help release park but preemptively strike north korea , too
<START> the divide limits the movements collective power
<START> the korean patriots party has just one member in the 300-seat parliament , but bareunmirae , a smaller , center-right party that includes conservatives who distanced themselves from park , has 30 seats
<START> liberty korea is by far the largest with 112 , but it remains split along pro- and anti-park lines
<START> to win more seats in 2020 , conservatives will have to think of a way to reach out to young voters , who polls show largely support moon and the north korean talks he has pushed
<START> recent reports that south koreas military had drawn up plans for martial law during the mostly youth-led anti-park protests have made that harder
<START> an emergency committee will decide the new leadership of liberty korea and with it , a new face for south korean conservatism
<START> but with the partys historic platforms now appearing out of touch with the korean public and u.s. leadership , the path is unclear
<START> some conservatives say they should stick to their guns , that north korean talks will soon break down and that their supporters could come back
<START> moon chung-in , a liberal academic and adviser to the president , agreed that conservatives fortunes could rebound if north korean talks fail
<START> he said , noting the power of major conservative newspapers such as chosun ilbo
<START> others , though , argue that liberty korea needs to pivot as the country changes
<START> kang yeon-jae , who joined the party this year , said its clear that people want peace with north korea
<START> conservatives need to accept that , she said , while serving as the voice of caution
<START> it was inevitable , lee said of the shift.
<START> its just changing earlier than we thought.
<START> actually , im looking forward to it , he added
<START> for older conservatives like hong , such an adaptation could prove harder
<START> taking a break from politics , hong flew to los angeles on wednesday
<START> he said his plan is to stay in the united states for the next few months studying north korean issues
