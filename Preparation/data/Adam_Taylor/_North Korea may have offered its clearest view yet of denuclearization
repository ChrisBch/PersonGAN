<START> if secretary of state mike pompeos visit to north korea on friday and saturday was designed to ease worries about the progress on denuclearization talks between washington and pyongyang , it seems to have failed
<START> just hours after pompeo left the north korean capital and described the negotiations as productive , north koreas foreign ministry released a scathing statement that cast the entire endeavor in doubt
<START> the statement said , adding that the american attitude toward the talks had been regrettable.
<START> but north koreas statement itself was notable for far more than just its negative tone
<START> running more than 1,200 words in an official english-language translation released on the state-run korea central news agency , it may offer the most comprehensive signal yet of how pyongyang views the possibility of abandoning its nuclear weapons
<START> north korea calls u.s. attitude toward talks gangster-like and cancerous , rejecting pompeos assessment
<START> this vision will not shock seasoned north korea-watchers , who say that pyongyang has been largely consistent on the nuclear issue over the years
<START> pyongyang is now emphasizing that it views the brief , 400-word agreement reached at that summit as just the very beginning of talks , not a promise to unilaterally disarm
<START> said joel wit , a former state department official who helped negotiate a 1994 nuclear agreement with north korea
<START> the statement released by pyongyang on saturday said that the first process of defusing tension would be to announce an official end to the korean war
<START> while they were in pyongyang
<START> instead , the statement said , the united states had continued its calls for cvid complete , verifiable and irreversible denuclearization
<START> that term has been repeatedly used by pompeo and other u.s. officials to describe washingtons aims in its talks with pyongyang , though the state department recently began using another term in its official statements final , fully verified denuclearization
<START> he noted that regional allies like japan may be concerned that only long-range missiles were included
<START> such comments made clear that north korea was ultimately seeking the removal of u.s. troops from the korean peninsula , according to duyeon kim , a fellow at the korean peninsula future forum
<START> the united states may not ultimately agree to north koreas goals , but wit and others said that talks should continue
<START> suggesting that the united states needed to find a special negotiator to meet continuously with the north koreans , wit said that it was a fantasy to think that this can be done overnight but that it could be done eventually
<START> right now , north korea appears to believe so too
<START> for all the harsh language in the foreign ministrys statement on saturday , it remained respectful of one man whose views of the negotiations are really crucial
<START> we still cherish our good faith in president trump , the statement read
