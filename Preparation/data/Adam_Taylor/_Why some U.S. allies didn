<START> president trump began his week at the u.n. general assembly with an event seeking to prompt action against the global drug trade
<START> many countries agreed according to the state department , 130 signed the document supporting action on the global war against drugs at the event
<START> that included countries big and small , from china and india down to swaziland ( now eswatini ) and micronesia
<START> but there are 193 states in the united nations
<START> so why did 63 countries , including u.s. allies and major european nations like spain , germany and the netherlands , decline to sign
<START> the clearest answer from a head of government came from new zealands prime minister , jacinda ardern , who said this weekend that her country would not be signing the agreement
<START> speaking to reporters on sunday , ardern argued that the document wasnt designed in a way that addressed new zealands problems
<START> spokesman frode overland andersen said in a statement
<START> most of the countries that did not sign have not publicly commented on the issue
<START> the representative spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the subject
<START> the document itself pledged to support a four-pronged anti-drug strategy that calls for expanding education and treatment measures as well as increasing border security and working to stop drug production
<START> the intercept reported last week that the document was nonnegotiable an unusual step and would not be considered an official u.n. document
<START> it had already drawn criticism from advocacy groups that argue evidence shows liberalized drug laws have proved more effective in combating addiction and crime than strict enforcement
