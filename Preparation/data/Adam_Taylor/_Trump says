<START> president trump lashed out tuesday at a new report that identified more than a dozen hidden bases in north korea that could be used to disperse mobile launchers for ballistic missiles , even as the president continues to claim a greatly diminished nuclear threat
<START> the release of the report monday by the center for strategic and international studies was covered by multiple news organizations , including the new york times , whose news story trump branded more fake news without disputing its content
<START> the story in the new york times concerning north korea developing missile bases is inaccurate
<START> we fully know about the sites being discussed , nothing new - and nothing happening out of the normal
<START> just more fake news
<START> i will be the first to let you know if things go bad
<START> after a much-touted summit in june with north korean leader kim jong un , trump said on twitter that there was no longer a nuclear threat from north korea.
<START> in public , he has largely kept this rosy view of negotiations
<START> were in no rush , he told reporters last week , when asked about the prospect of a second summit with kim , adding that the missiles have stopped , the rockets have stopped.
<START> the csis report is the latest evidence that while north korea has indeed stopped its missile testing , it is far from dismantling its weapons facilities
<START> indeed , it appears to be adding to its stockpile
<START> in the report , csis used satellite imagery and interviews with north korean defectors and government officials to identify 13 missile bases
<START> they say there are seven more bases that remain hidden
<START> the csis team was led by victor cha , a north korea expert whom the trump administration considered nominating as ambassador to south korea last year
<START> his name was not put forward , however , after cha privately expressed disagreement in late december with the trump administrations north korea policy
