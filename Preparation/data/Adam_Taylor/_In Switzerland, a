<START> two years after a so-called burqa ban was implemented in a region of switzerland , new figures show that the measure may not have reached its targeted perpetrators
<START> in a statement released tuesday , the government in ticino said it had begun only 37 legal proceedings and given out a few warnings since the law took effect in july 2016
<START> but rather than finding muslim women who wear face-covering veils such as the burqa or the niqab , swiss police in the canton have ended up fining mask-wearing soccer fans instead
<START> of the 10 cases since the beginning of the year , the majority occurred in the context of sports hooliganism , the statement from ticinos department of institutions said
<START> according to the swiss news agency sda-ats , authorities say the number of muslim women affected by the ban could be counted on one hand
<START> the data was released amid renewed controversy surrounding the burqa and other islamic veils across europe
<START> in britain , former foreign secretary boris johnson has been called upon to apologize for comparing burqa-wearing women to letter boxes , though he said he did not support banning the attire
<START> a number of european nations including france and belgium have some form of ban on burqas on the books , while others , including germany , have mooted the idea
<START> italian-speaking ticino has a small population of over 350,000
<START> it is the only canton in switzerland to ban the burqa , but there is a campaign for a nationwide ban , and polls show widespread public support for such a measure
<START> ticino held a referendum in 2013 in which it decided to ban the wearing of all face-covering garments in public
<START> the law proposes a fine of at least 100 swiss francs ( $ 100 ) for covering the face in public , with certain exceptions for safety , health and swiss traditions
<START> though the law did not explicitly single out muslim garments such as the burqa in its wording , the chief campaigner behind the measure , former journalist giorgio ghiringhelli , said at the time that the move was a signal against radical islamism.
<START> the widespread presence of burqas in a country does not appear to be prerequisite for a ban
<START> in 2016 , as germany debated a ban of islamic face coverings , reporters struggled to find a single person who wore the all-covering burqa in the country
<START> ( a small number of people , around 300 , were estimated to wear the less restrictive niqab )
<START> in france , where the burqa was banned in 2011 , a study by the french interior ministry said that few women wore the burqa in the country and that only about 2,000 wore the niqab
<START> sociologists who have studied the bans effect on muslim women said that many women who wore the veil before now stay home and dont venture outside
