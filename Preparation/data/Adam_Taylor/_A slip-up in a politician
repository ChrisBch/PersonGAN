<START> british news outlets had reported overnight that cable was planning to use the phrase erotic spasm in a speech critical of the pro-brexit forces in westminster at the annual liberal democrat conference in brighton
<START> the phrase caught the attention of many journalists because of its sexual undertones
<START> but cable appeared to misspeak when he reached that key phrase on tuesday , instead saying something that sounded a lot like exotic spresm though spresm is not a word in the english language
<START> the slip-up immediately prompted jokes on twitter , drawing ridicule from such high-profile media personalities as former english soccer player gary lineker
<START> so excited for tonights game between liverpool & psg , i might be in danger of having an exotic spresm
<START> tim farron , a liberal democrat member of parliament and cables predecessor as leader of the party , also poked fun at the mistake in his tweet
<START> an *exotic* spasm
<START> is that an anti climax
<START> ( sorry )
<START> and those who question the faith are unwelcome.
<START> ( most recent polls estimate the liberal democrats nationwide support at less than 10 percent )
<START> the party did little to influence the direction of the coalition government between 2010 and 2015 , and its popularity suffered deeply as a result of austerity policies put in place at the time
<START> cable , who held a senior position in government as business secretary , went on to lose his seat in parliament in the 2015 election
<START> he won it back last year
<START> speaking to the observer newspaper on saturday , cable said his party would not join a coalition government with prime minister theresa mays conservatives or jeremy corbyns labour in the immediate future.
<START> theyre both pretty appalling in different ways , cable said
<START> britain is due to leave the e.u
<START> in march , but the prime minister has struggled to find support for a new free-trade agreement with the bloc within her own party let along among e.u
<START> officials prompting widespread concern that the country could end up with a no-deal brexit that would result in economic turmoil for britain as trade ground to a halt
