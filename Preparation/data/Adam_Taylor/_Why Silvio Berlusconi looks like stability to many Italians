<START> former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is 81 years old
<START> berlusconi has n't been prime minister since 2011 , when he was forced from office amid a national debt crisis
<START> he was later convicted of tax fraud and stripped of his seat in italy 's parliament
<START> nevertheless , berlusconi is a key figure in this weekend 's elections , and the chart above should give you an idea why
<START> italian politics are characterized by instability
<START> in the past 30 years , there have been 13 different prime ministers in the country
<START> the only one to serve a full five-year term since 1988 was berlusconi , who has been prime minister for a little over nine total years during three separate stints
<START> that 's the longest time in office of any prime minister since the fascist dictator benito mussolini
<START> this is an unusual level of political turnover in a major european economy to say the least
<START> in the past 30 years , there have been just three german chancellors , five french presidents and six british prime ministers
<START> even among smaller western european countries that have relatively volatile parliamentary systems , the rate of change in italy stands out belgium and austria have had eight parliamentary leaders in the same period , for example
<START> given the high rate of turnover in italy , berlusconi may seem like a safe pair of hands a laughable concept given that he ca n't even hold office until next year due to his fraud conviction.
<START> berlusconi is there because others have failed , said massimo franco , a columnist at the corriere della sera newspaper , to the washington post recently.
<START> hes a survivor.
<START> italians are well aware that their political instability is not a good thing
<START> according to e.u
<START> data from last year , 60 percent of italians are unsatisfied with how their democracy works
<START> unfortunately for them , attempts to overhaul this process do n't appear to be working
<START> these attempts are long-running berlusconi 's forza italia movement made its own effort when it was in opposition in 2006
<START> ten years later , the center-left government of matteo renzi held its own referendum on reforms that would change the way italians voted and put more power into the hands of the prime minister
<START> that bid also failed , forcing renzi a key rival to the center-right berlusconi to resign at the end of 2016
<START> new laws were finally passed in 2017 after a laborious debate between those who favored a strictly representative parliament that supported smaller parties and those who wanted to introduce majoritarian measures to ensure stable governments
<START> critics say that the end result was ultimately an unsatisfying and unnecessarily complicated hodgepodge of these two schools of thought
<START> many expect no party to gain an outright majority on their own in the upcoming election
<START> a recent poll of economists conducted by bloomberg found 38 percent of italians believed there would be a hung parliament after the election , while 33 percent suggested there could be a grand coalition of berlusconi 's center-right alliance and renzi 's center-left democratic party
<START> given the political fragmentation in italy , all of these scenarios carry the risk of government collapse , raising the prospect of new elections or even another rewrite of election laws
<START> and guess whose prime ministerial career began after the most recent of those two political crises
