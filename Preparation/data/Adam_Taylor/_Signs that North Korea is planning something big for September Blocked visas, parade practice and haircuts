<START> north korea is planning a party
<START> next month , the reclusive country will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the country , officially known as the democratic peoples republic of korea
<START> and there are signs that the event , which will take place sept. 9 , will be a celebration to watch
<START> those observing the preparations for the event have spotted practice for a military parade , while tourist visas to the country have apparently been blocked sparking speculation about who , exactly , the vip guests could be
<START> according to one report , a close eye is being kept on the finest details ruling-party youth groups have been sent around the country to keep tabs on taboo haircuts , radio free asia reports
<START> the north korean state cherishes anniversaries , using them to reinforce the tale of how their small , embattled state fought off bigger foes such as imperial japan and the united states
<START> it often uses parades on these days to send a message to these foreign rivals
<START> on last years anniversary in september , kim held an event where he celebrated the work of nuclear scientists and engineers who had helped the country test its biggest-ever nuclear bomb just a few days earlier
<START> earlier in the year , in february , north korea had used another military parade to display the recently tested hwasong-14 and hwasong-15 missiles that could theoretically deliver a nuclear weapon to the continental united states
<START> this years dprk anniversary event will be different , however
<START> in many ways , the messaging behind it will be more complex
<START> north korea was previously happy to menace the united states and other rivals with visions of military might as tensions escalated rapidly
<START> this june , however , north korean leader kim jong un met with president trump in singapore , where they agreed to work toward peace
<START> kim has also held several meetings with his south korean counterpart , president moon jae-in , with both sides talking hopefully of greater integration
<START> the negotiations that started with these meetings have been far from conclusive
<START> as such , although relations are nominally warmer with the united states , a surprise trump visit to pyongyang on sept. 9 looks unlikely
<START> instead , many are expecting a different guest chinese president xi jinping whose presence would send a message to washington that it isnt the only game in town
<START> either way , sept. 9 is expected to be a big event
<START> look who 's getting ready for a parade
<START> the images from planetlabs are taken ten minutes apart -- you can see the cards flip
<START> it is unclear from the imagery what sort of weaponry might be included in the parade
<START> koryo later wrote that this applied only to tours up until sept. 9
<START> they wrote in their statement
<START> chinese tour groups have also said they have had their packages blocked with north korean authorities apparently citing renovation at all hotels in pyongyang for the rest of august
<START> there had been rumors in the south korean media that xi would attend in september
<START> south korean leader moon is also expected to visit north korea at some point that month
<START> reports a few years ago that north korea was mandating the haircuts of young men were largely met with suspicion from experts , who suggested that a trend toward copying kim jong uns hairstyle was just that a trend
<START> but theres no denying that north korea will be image-conscious this september it certainly knows the world will be watching
