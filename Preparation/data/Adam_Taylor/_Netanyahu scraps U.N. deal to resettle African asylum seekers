<START> israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on tuesday scrapped an agreement with the united nations to resettle thousands of african asylum seekers in the west , giving in to pressure from immigration hard-liners who saw the deal as rewarding illegal migrants
<START> after speaking to residents of southern tel aviv , a traditionally working-class area where many african migrants settled in recent years , netanyahu said he decided to cancel the agreement.
<START> without the u.n. deal , thousands of sudanese and eritrean migrants will be left in legal limbo within israel
<START> around 38,000 live in israel , most of whom entered the country illegally via the land border with egypt before a fence was completed in 2013
<START> activists say many would face persecution if they were returned home
<START> on monday , netanyahu announced an unprecedented understanding with the u.n. refugee agency that would move more than 16,000 migrants to western nations
<START> the same number would be given temporary residency status within israel
<START> first , a deal
<START> then it was on hold
<START> netanyahu concurrently announced that israel would set up a body to implement a rehabilitation plan for southern tel aviv and encourage african migrants to move out of the area
<START> the agreement took many in israel by surprise
<START> under a deportation initiative being carried out since february , male african migrants had been given notices warning them that they had two months to leave the country or face jail
<START> the migrants were offered $ 3,500 to relocate to an unnamed third country widely reported to be uganda or rwanda or return to their home country
<START> legal and political problems had slowed the deportation plan dramatically
<START> advocacy groups working on behalf of the migrants challenged the policy in israels high court , securing a temporary freeze of the plan on march 15
<START> the agreement with the united nations was greeted with praise from many human rights groups , but the number of african migrants allowed to stay in the country proved to be a problem for netanyahus base
<START> one poll released by israels channel 10 found that 47 percent of the country was against the deal , while 34 percent supported it
<START> in a late-night facebook post monday , netanyahu said he would suspend the agreements implementation until he had a chance to speak to delegates from neighborhoods in southern tel aviv
<START> the pause in the plan dominated israels front pages tuesday , with yedioth ahronoth , the largest-circulation newspaper in the country , running the headline netanyahu folds.
<START> for critics , suspension alone was not enough
<START> naftali bennett , leader of the nationalist jewish home party , tweeted critically of the u.n. agreement early tuesday , saying netanyahu should cancel it altogether.
<START> just hours later , netanyahu called off the resettlement plan.
<START> well keep looking for solutions , he said in a statement
<START> anshel pfeffer , a correspondent for the haaretz newspaper and author of a forthcoming biography of netanyahu , said that the israeli leader had underestimated the opposition to the agreement and that an ongoing corruption scandal had left him susceptible to social media backlash
<START> it is unclear if israel could now return to its previous plan to deport african asylum seekers
<START> daniel sokatch , chief executive of the new israel fund , denied claims that the fund had pressured rwanda and offered to answer any questions the israeli government has
<START> netanyahu lashes out to deflect attention from his own morally bankrupt choices , sokatch said tuesday
