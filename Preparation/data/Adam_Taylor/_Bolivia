<START> president trump chaired a meeting of the united nations security council on wednesday
<START> the meeting , which unusually took place at the level of heads of state or government , was called to deal with issues surrounding nonproliferation
<START> however , for bolivias leftist leader evo morales , it was also a chance to meet face-to-face with his american counterpart and the bolivian president used the opportunity to offer a lengthy criticism of u.s. foreign policy excesses and failures
<START> later , morales accused the united states of promoting torture and said the trump administration had separated migrant children from their families and put them in cages.
<START> morales spoke fifth at the meeting , after representatives of the united states , france , poland and equatorial guinea
<START> the country is not a permanent member of the security council but has a rotating seat for 2017 and 2018
<START> he said , referring to iran.
<START> after that , for many decades the united states supported an authoritarian government that allowed the profits from oil companies to line the pockets of transnational countries
<START> the bolivian leader also said that the united states was responsible for the most egregious acts of aggression committed during the 21st century , including the military invasion of iraq , the military intervention in libya and the civil war in syria
<START> morales also criticized trump for threatening venezuela and for its opposition to the international criminal court
<START> moraless harsh words drew surprise from some observers , as trump is not frequently challenged by world leaders so directly
<START> at unsc meeting on nonproliferation of wmd bolivia 's president evo morales ayma is giving the trump a lecture on interference and meddling and double standards on 2003 iraq invasion , violating jcpoa , overthrow of gaddaffi , u.s. immigration policy , more
<START> but while some experts on the united nations had expressed concerns that trump would respond angrily to criticism at the security council meeting this week , he offered little visible reaction after morales spoke
<START> though secretary of state mike pompeo looked toward the bolivian leader , sometimes appearing to smirk , trump mostly stared down at his papers
<START> when morales had finished speaking , he simply responded thank you , mr. president.
<START> under morales , bolivia has been a fierce critic of u.s. foreign policy
<START> in 2008 , it expelled the u.s. ambassador and threw out american departments such as the u.s. agency for international development and the drug enforcement administration
<START> speaking earlier this week , bolivias ambassador to the united nations , sacha llorenti , said that the country was using its seat at the security council to protect the u.n. charter from being undermined by countries such as the united states
