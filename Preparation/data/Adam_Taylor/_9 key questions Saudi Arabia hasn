<START> saudi arabia offered an explanation early saturday for what had happened to journalist jamal khashoggi in istanbul , 17 days after he went missing at the kingdoms consulate in istanbul
<START> but even though the kingdom finally confirmed that khashoggi had died inside the consulate , as turkish officials had alleged , the saudi account of how that happened conflicts with information from other sources , and key details appear to be missing
<START> below are nine questions that the saudi kingdom still needs to answer
<START> was khashoggi really considering a return to saudi arabia
<START> the saudi statement said that the suspects in khashoggis killing had traveled to turkey to meet with the journalist as he had suggested he was interested in returning home
<START> however , khashoggi had traveled to the consulate with his fiancee , turkish national hatice cengiz , who has said that her partner was seeking a document from the saudi government that would allow them to wed
<START> after one such attempt , khaled saffuri , an arab american political activist , recounted to the washington post
<START> if this was just a discussion , why did at least 15 men travel to istanbul for the meeting
<START> the saudi government account suggests that the encounter with khashoggi began as a discussion but soon turned negative and developed into a a fight and a quarrel between some of the suspects and the citizen
<START> it is not clear why such a big group of people would be needed for a discussion about a willing return to saudi arabia
<START> why did this saudi group include a forensic expert and members of security forces
<START> again , if this were a simple discussion , it would seem unnecessary to send members of the saudi security services
<START> however , the post has found that at least 12 members of the alleged hit team identified by turkish authorities had some kind of link to the kingdoms security services
<START> one of the suspects , salah muhammed al-tubaigy , was a forensic expert known for pioneering rapid and mobile autopsies
<START> bruce riedel , a brookings institution fellow and former cia official who has written a book about saudi-u.s. relations , said this stuck out to him
<START> riedel told the post
<START> the saudi statement also did not explain why the suspects may have brought a bone saw into turkey , as some reports have suggested
<START> the washington post has not been able to confirm this detail
<START> what actually happened inside the consulate
<START> the saudi account describes a fight or a quarrel in the consulate a wording that implies a physical dispute between two sides
<START> however , khashoggi had entered the facility on his own and was apparently meeting a team of 15 men , suggesting at least that the two sides were not equal
<START> turkish officials are believed to have played to cia counterparts an audio recording that was made inside the consulate that could shed some light on what happened
<START> the recording could provide key clues into what happened to khashoggi including whether his death was intentional or whether he was tortured
<START> what happened to khashoggis body
<START> even though saudi arabia now admits that the journalist died inside the consulate , its statement saturday did not reveal what happened to the body
<START> early speculation suggested that khashoggis body parts may have been taken out of the country , although turkish authorities recently searched rural areas near istanbul
<START> a saudi source told reuters on friday that the whereabouts of khashoggis body were unclear after it was handed over to a local cooperator.
<START> why did saudi arabia say he had left the consulate when he had not
<START> when khashoggi didnt return from the consulate , his partner , cengiz , who was waiting outside , raised the alarm
<START> however , saudi officials repeatedly told reporters that the journalist had left the consulate by a back entrance shortly after he arrived and that they too were concerned about his fate
<START> how could the crown prince not have known
<START> the saudi account makes no suggestion that the crown prince knew about what happened to khashoggi
<START> indeed , he has been tapped by his father , king salman , to lead a commission that is designed to review and modernize the kingdoms intelligence operations after the death of the journalist
<START> the 33-year-old mohammed is widely considered the real power in saudi arabia , however , and he has led the drive to modernize the country
<START> some experts also say that he is behind a clampdown on free speech.
<START> this never would have happened without mbss approval
<START> never , never , never , a former senior u.s. diplomat told the post shortly after khashoggi disappeared
<START> saud al-qahtani , an adviser to the crown prince , was among those fired saturday
<START> he had previously been behind attempts to lure khashoggi back to saudi arabia , according to u.s. officials
<START> after the kingdoms announcement on saturday , a message he had written on twitter last year was shared widely on social media
<START> are the men detained by saudi arabia actually the same men that were identified by turkish authorities
<START> the saudi government said 18 people had been arrested
<START> it was unclear , however , whether these people were the same 15 suspects who had been identified by turkish authorities
<START> a report on the saudi-owned al-arabiya news channel had previously said that the 15 were tourists who had been falsely accused
<START> why did it take 17 days to come up with this account
<START> more than two weeks have passed since khashoggi disappeared
<START> thomas juneau , an expert on saudi arabia at the university of ottawa , wrote on twitter that the situation had exposed the weakness of saudi administrative capacity and that there was a general impression things were botched
