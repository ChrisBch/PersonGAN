<START> the cctv new years gala is one of the highlights of the state broadcaster 's year in china and probably one of the world 's most-watched television events
<START> with an estimated 700 million viewers , the show 's audience is about seven times as large as the most recent super bowl
<START> however , the gala has not been without controversy
<START> three years ago , the televised variety show angered feminists , who accused it of having a misogynistic tone
<START> now , the latest gala has caused an international outcry by featuring a chinese actress in blackface with huge prosthetic buttocks representing an african woman
<START> the skit , which aired thursday , was designed to celebrate the numerous links between china and african nations , including a new chinese-built high-speed rail line in kenya
<START> critics say the segment ended up stereotyping africans in a condescending manner
<START> ugh the sketch on africa during the cctv spring festival gala ( possibly the most watched show in the world ) was cringeworthy at best , completely racist at worst
<START> it 's africa , so bring out tribal dancers & animals
<START> and was that a chinese woman in blackface with a fake posterior
<START> the mother , played by chinese actress lou naiming , then enters the scene , accompanied by an actor in a monkey costume
<START> after the host introduces his chinese wife , the mother says she can not be angry about the ruse because of the strong bond between chinese people and african people.
<START> i love chinese people
<START> i love china , the mother says
<START> china has made billions of dollars of investments in sub-saharan africa in recent years , with a big push to improve infrastructure on the continent as part of its global one belt , one road initiative
<START> polls have shown that in general , africans welcome the chinese investment , but there are often points of tension , including a widespread concern that chinese investments pillage natural resources on the continent or aid bad governance
<START> the skit caused widespread criticism on social media outside china , with many in africa or the african diaspora taking offense
<START> within china , african groups complained about the segment on social media on the popular microblogging network weibo , many chinese viewers agreed it was in poor taste
<START> this is plain racism , the foreign media are going to explode , wrote one user in a message noted by the blog what 's on weibo
<START> zhou hengshan , 80 , told an associated press reporter in beijing
<START> chinese television has been accused of racism before
<START> in an advertisement aired in 2016 , a young chinese woman used laundry detergent to change a dirty-looking black man into a clean-looking chinese man
<START> local media later reported the advertiser had been removed from the internet and the company behind it had apologized
