<START> china 's communist party announced this week that it planned to abolish the two-term limit on the presidency
<START> in theory , such a change could allow the country 's current president , xi jinping , to rule for life a worrying prospect for those who are concerned about his authoritarian tendencies
<START> but does this proposed change mean that xi will be china 's president until he dies
<START> the evidence from other countries that abolished term limits is mixed
<START> the concept of term limits is an old one , dating at least to ancient greece
<START> in the united states , term limits were debated by thomas jefferson and alexander hamilton but written into law only in 1951 , part of a late-20th-century boom in the concept
<START> according to a study by boniface dulani , a lecturer in political science at the university of malawi , by 2009 almost three-quarters of all presidential political systems had some kind of legal limit on tenure
<START> china 's own presidential term limit was spelled out in the 1982 constitution , which sought to fix the mistakes of the chaotic mao zedong period
<START> but if term limits can be put in place , they can also be removed
<START> china would not be the first country to make this shift
<START> in general , efforts to remove term limits seem to be successful 79 percent of legislation aimed at removing term limits has passed , dulani found when he looked at 48 countries that discussed the removal of term limits
<START> while there are numerous differences among each of these situations , in general we can break down the eventual outcome of these cases into three groups
<START> in addition , we will have to include another category for those cases in which the eventual fate of the leader is not known
<START> while the fate of this last group remains unclear , the strongest evidence we have suggests that a term-limit-avoiding president may be more likely to become an ousted-against-their-will than a ruler-for-life.
<START> looking at 47 world leaders who extended their time in office during the period between 1960 and 2010 , he found that only eight had died in office , while 13 had stepped down and retired and three had lost reelections
<START> more than half of the total number , however , had been violently ousted from office ( 18 ) or assassinated ( five )
<START> baturo said in an email
<START> whether this will apply to xi is unclear
<START> unlike most of the countries included here , china is not even nominally a democracy , and the inner workings of its top leadership can be hard to ascertain
<START> it 's also worth noting that other world leaders have managed to cling to power without abolishing term limits russia 's vladimir putin being the most noteworthy example
<START> by seeking to avoid term limits , xi may be doing away with the relative stability ensured by his predecessors , who had abided by the two-term system installed in 1982
<START> the removal of term limits is an important institution that demarcates dictators proper from other strong leaders and may signal a shift toward personalized politics in china , baturo said
<START> and , in general , personalized regimes are not only less democratic but also more politically volatile
<START> for now , however , xi is a too-soon-to-tell.
