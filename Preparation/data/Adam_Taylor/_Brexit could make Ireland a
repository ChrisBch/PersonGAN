<START> the special relationship between britain and the united states has been a fixture of international politics for decades
<START> could washington now also have a special friend in ireland
<START> daniel mulhall , irelands ambassador in washington , thinks so
<START> and he says its largely because of britains departure from the european union
<START> those hopes even have a tangible symbol this month , seeking to expand its diplomatic mission in washington , the irish government closed a deal to buy a 6,500-square-foot building once used by the egyptian embassy
<START> its still a far cry from britains gargantuan embassy compound , one of the biggest in washington , but its a signal of dublins intent
<START> before he took up residence in washington last year , mulhall served as irelands ambassador to britain
<START> he personally campaigned against britains vote to leave the e.u
<START> in 2016 after british voters approved brexit , he later told a reporter , he felt sadness that britains relationship with ireland was being risked
<START> now he sees brexit as a new opportunity for ireland one that could rival many brexiteers own hopes for an economic future that relies on greater trade with the united states and other nations outside of europe
<START> said mays predecessor , david cameron , in a 2010 speech
<START> with britain looking to leave the e.u. , many other e.u
<START> countries are now pledging to become washingtons new gateway to europe.
<START> ireland may be a particularly attractive base for american companies its common-law system is similar to the american legal structure , and it is known for being one of the most business-friendly countries in the e.u
<START> mulhall pointed out
<START> said neil dooley , a politics lecturer at the university of sussex
<START> given that ireland is a relatively small country just 4.7 million people even a small change could have profound effects on the economy
<START> irish firms are in the process of reforming their business plans for a post-brexit future , according to sean davis , the regional director for enterprise ireland , a state economic agency that promotes new export sales
<START> davis said that 73 percent of irish companies that work with enterprise ireland have taken some kind of action to deal with a post-brexit future
<START> that often means planning to steer their exports away from britain.
<START> the u.k. is going to become less attractive to irish companies , davis said
<START> companies sponsored by enterprise ireland opened 59 offices in the united states last year , according to davis
<START> in total , there are more than 800 irish-owned companies in the united states , with 100,000 people employed by irish-origin companies
<START> thats a useful talking point given the trump administrations focus on protecting american jobs , but there could be other issues down the line
<START> the united states has a considerable trade deficit with the ireland , and trump has specifically called out the country as a tax haven.
<START> the tax cuts passed by republicans in 2017 appear to have hit u.s. investment in ireland , according to irish estimates
<START> and with trump , theres always the risk of unexpected feuds
<START> the president is at odds with the irish government on a variety of foreign policy issues he has already canceled one trip to ireland amid planned mass protests
<START> said brian lucey , a professor at trinity business school at trinity college dublin.
<START> particularly with trump , where theres a hard-nosed , mercantilist approach.
