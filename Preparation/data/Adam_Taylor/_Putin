<START> russian president vladimir putin used an annual speech this week to make bold claims about invincible new russian weapons that could easily overcome u.s. missile defenses
<START> among the weapons putin said had been successfully tested was a cruise missile with a nuclear-propulsion engine a weapon that would fly at a low altitude and follow an unpredictable flight path to avoid u.s. missile defense systems
<START> but how worried should americans be about russia 's new missiles
<START> it 's certainly true that , if putin 's claims are accurate , they represent a step forward in missile technology that existing u.s. missile systems would be unable to match
<START> there 's another important detail here , however u.s. missile defense systems are almost certainly no match for existing russian missiles , either
<START> kingston reif , director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the arms control association , said that russia would have no problem whatsoever overcoming u.s. missile defenses with its existing weapons
<START> as such , putin 's shiny new weapons do n't necessarily change the core strategic balance with the united states
<START> they may , however , show the limits of trying to contain nuclear threats from nations such as russia or even smaller threats like north korea by missile defense alone
<START> why russian missiles are hard to hit , even now
<START> building a missile that can accurately deliver a nuclear weapon to the other side of the world is difficult it is rocket science , after all
<START> but building another weapon that can take out that missile before it strikes its target
<START> that 's even harder
<START> the idea of a missile defense system to protect the united states first appeared during the cold war
<START> in the 1980s , president ronald reagan pushed a strategic defense initiative , colloquially known as star wars , that would seek to offer complete protection to the united states from ballistic missiles
<START> however , the system was criticized for being unrealistic and too costly
<START> after the collapse of the soviet union , this all-encompassing idea of missile defense was reshaped to focus on protecting the united states from smaller rogue states such as north korea and iran
<START> as the washington post reported friday , the trump administration is now planning a change away from this , to a missile defense system that could deal with resurgent threats from russia and china
<START> the united states has 44 missile interceptors based in alaska and california , as well as sea and land-based systems in europe and asia
<START> though there are plans for a modest increase in these numbers , experts say they offer little protection against a well-equipped country such as russia , which had sophisticated technology as well as sheer numbers that could overwhelm u.s. systems
<START> indeed , there are reasonable doubts about the current systems ability to block a threat from a relatively unsophisticated missile power such as north korea
<START> last year , pyongyang conducted a number of missile tests at night a worrying idea , as u.s. missile systems in alaska and california have had only limited and unsuccessful testing in the dark
<START> north korea has also made technological advancements that may allow it to launch multiple missiles at once from mobile launchers , a tactic that could put a big strain on missile defense technology if used in a real-world scenario
<START> how russia 's new weapons are different
<START> the big difference between the missiles russia already has and the ones announced thursday is that existing missiles are ballistic , whereas the new missiles would be cruise missiles
<START> ballistic missiles are launched into the atmosphere and then come down toward their target , whereas cruise missiles fly low to the ground
<START> the key development outlined in putin 's speech was that russia 's cruise missile would be nuclear-powered , which would significantly increase their range and allow them to make lengthy detours to avoid detection
<START> given the differences in the way the missiles fly , the defensive systems designed to deal with them need to be different
<START> while the united states does have systems designed to counter ballistic missiles , they would not work against a cruise missile
<START> and though there are interceptors designed to destroy cruise missiles , it can be hard to see them coming u.s. radar systems designed for ballistic missiles would n't catch cruise missiles in time , as they can not see over the curve of earth
<START> this does n't mean they are impossible to defend against
<START> williams suggested that some kind of elevated radar system , on an aircraft or balloon or even in space , would be able to spot cruise missiles
<START> a new u.s. missile defense policy may also emphasize the ability to take out a missile before it is launched
<START> the united states does not currently have these capabilities , and developing them will be difficult and costly
<START> however , the most compelling deterrence against launching a nuclear strike the threat of a retaliatory nuclear strike is little affected by russia 's new missile technology
<START> why putin 's announcement is worrisome
<START> russia analysts say that moscow views u.s. missile defense as a threat because of concerns that the united states might strike first and take out most of russia 's arsenal , then rely on its missile defense system to stave off a russian retaliatory strike
<START> however , if putin was really concerned about this , he would n't need a nuclear-powered cruise missile
<START> putin 's decision to publicly announce the new weapons technology may be largely domestic in focus
<START> russia is just weeks away from a presidential election
<START> though putin is expected to win easily , most analysts think that the kremlin is hoping for high turnout something that a little patriotic nuclear-missile unveiling may help with
<START> to arms control proponents , russia 's new weapons are far from a game-changer , but they should serve as a reminder that missile defense alone is no substitute for a shared understanding with russia and other nuclear countries about the risks of nuclear war
<START> americans have never been comfortable accepting the idea of vulnerability , lewis said.
<START> these weapons dont change our vulnerability , although they do force us to confront it.
