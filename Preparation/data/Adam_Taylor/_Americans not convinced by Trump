<START> the trump administrations willingness to spark a trade war with china might well be its most ambitious foreign policy move
<START> but what does it mean for u.s. policy if a majority of americans dont agree that china is such a worrying threat
<START> and what happens if they dont think a trade war is worth the cost
<START> newly released polling data from the chicago council on global affairs raises these questions and more
<START> the data suggest that although many americans think the rise of china is an important concern , it ranks lower than many other global problems
<START> according to the survey , 39 percent of the country views chinas growing power as a critical threat to americans
<START> that ranked it only eighth among 12 potential threats listed and placed china well behind the perceived threats from international terrorism ( 66 percent ) , north koreas nuclear program ( 59 percent ) and irans nuclear program ( 52 percent )
<START> its also considerably lower than when the same question was asked during the 1990s , when more than half of those polled listed china as a critical threat
<START> that broadly tracks with a recent poll from the pew research center that found concern about u.s.-china economic issues had decreased since 2012
<START> and while trump may believe that trade wars are good and easy to win , many americans appear to have serious doubts about that
<START> a slightly larger percentage of respondents said that the possibility of a trade war with china was more of a critical threat than the rise of china overall 42 percent compared with 39
<START> democrats felt far stronger than republicans on this , with 54 percent of the former saying it was a critical threat compared to 28 percent of the latter
<START> yet 72 percent said they were either very or somewhat concerned that such a trade war would hurt their own areas
<START> again there was a considerable partisan divide only 56 percent of republicans felt this way , compared with 83 percent of democrats
<START> glaser noted that while many americans have not yet felt much impact from the tariffs , that probably will change next year
<START> more broadly , the poll found americans divided in their views on china , with 49 percent saying china is mostly a rival compared to 50 percent who say its mostly a partner
<START> thats a long-standing divide , seen in both the chicago councils polling on china and pews surveys of u.s. views of china
<START> the two countries are perceived to have different kinds of influence
<START> military strength is washingtons greatest means of influencing other countries , americans told the chicago council , while beijing is more influential in terms of economic power and technology and innovation
<START> culture , politics and economic aid were perceived to have relatively little power
<START> despite americans perceptions of the influence of u.s. military strength , however , there is little support for using military force against china
<START> even if china were to engage in a military conflict over disputed islands in its region , 56 percent said they would oppose the use of u.s. troops
<START> a slightly larger majority , 61 percent , opposed the use of u.s. troops if china invaded taiwan
<START> americans are not always reticent to send in the military in another recent chicago council poll , majorities of americans said that u.s. troops should be used if north korea attacked south korea or japan
<START> in the case of china , many americans seem unsure whether the threat posed to the united states itself is actually worth the risk
<START> the gfk knowledge panel was recruited through random sampling methods
