<START> the turkish lira dropped dramatically against the dollar friday , losing more than 18 percent of its value in one day worsening an already months-long decline for turkeys currency
<START> what caused this steep drop in the price of the lira
<START> there are multiple factors , many of which are related to the economic policies of turkeys leader , recep tayyip erdogan
<START> but on friday , there was another distinct element that made things worse a tweet from president trump
<START> i have just authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to turkey as their currency , the turkish lira , slides rapidly downward against our very strong dollar
<START> aluminum will now be 20 % and steel 50 %
<START> our relations with turkey are not good at this time
<START> at 8.47 a.m. eastern time 3:47 p.m. in turkey trump had turned to twitter to announce that he would be doubling steel and aluminum sanctions on turkey
<START> the move came as washington was in a diplomatic standoff with ankara over turkeys detention of an evangelical pastor from north carolina
<START> the detention of andrew brunson , who is facing trial on charges related to a failed 2016 coup in turkey , has caused a major setback in relations between the two nato allies
<START> last week , the united states implemented punitive sanctions on two members of the turkish cabinet and warned of further measures to come
<START> this economic uncertainty had rattled turkeys already shaky economy , and the lira had dropped a number of times since the beginning of august
<START> on friday , before trumps tweet , erdogan had tried to stem the sell-off by appealing to turkish citizens to exchange any dollars , euros or gold for lira to help the currency.
<START> this is a national , domestic battle , he told a crowd in the northeastern city of bayburt , according to reuters
<START> this will be my peoples response to those who have waged an economic war against us.
<START> erdogans words did little to reassure investors
<START> the price of the lira dropped significantly immediately after he spoke
<START> many analysts have dismissed erdogans complaints about a foreign-led economic war against turkey , suggesting they were largely a scapegoat for the failings of the turkish leaders own economic policies
<START> the trump administration is no stranger to using its economic power as a political weapon to hit foreign powers
<START> it has stepped up sanctions against countries such as north korea , iran and russia , among others
<START> in a number of countries , most notably iran and russia , this has caused the value of their currency to drop significantly
<START> at the same time , the united states is fighting an economic war against china through tariffs and other measures
