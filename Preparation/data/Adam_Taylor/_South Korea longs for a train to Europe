<START> goseong , south korea every week for the past 12 years , a small team has headed past military checkpoints and barbed wire fences to the farthest northeast corner of south korea , where they clean a railway station that never sees any trains
<START> apart from a few never-used metal detectors , the spotless station lies completely empty
<START> the timetable is blank , the ticket offices are closed
<START> indeed , only one passenger train has ever arrived at jejin station it came from north korea in 2007
<START> kim jung-ja , a 60-year-old real estate agent in a nearby town , said that property prices had jumped in anticipation of a reopened railroad connection to the north.
<START> could there be a train to russia from here
<START> she wondered aloud
<START> theres a catch , however
<START> for south korea to actually reconnect its rail network to north korea , it will first have to convince the united states to reconsider the maximum pressure policy toward pyongyang
<START> and almost two months after president trump met north koreas kim jong un in singapore , that seems unlikely anytime soon
<START> during their meeting in the peninsulas demilitarized zone in late april , south korean president moon jae-in handed kim a usb stick containing detailed plans for an inter-korean rail network
<START> the two korean leaders agreed to work toward reconnecting their rail network , built under imperial japan at the turn of the 20th century , then severed during the korean war in the 1950s
<START> we can not go further , said moon chung-in , an influential adviser to the south korean president.
<START> because of the sanctions regime.
<START> there is growing frustration that a slow pace on sanctions could dash renewed hopes for a connection
<START> its so stressful that the united states is so controlling , said song young-gil , a south korean politician who recently inspected north koreas railways for the presidents office
<START> for many south koreans , the prospect of reconnecting the rail link to north korea is one of the most evocative , even romantic , aspects of the korean detente
<START> it represents not only a step toward eventual reunification of north and south but also a correction to the cruel 20th-century history that made their nation an island without an open land border
<START> much attention has been focused on a west coast line between seoul and pyongyang
<START> in the dmz not far from seoul , another station that opened in 2007 is now a tourist attraction where visitors can buy tickets and look at part of the berlin wall
<START> but while a west coast railroad would connect political capitals , an east coast line through jejin would be important for two key areas of moons plans for cooperation with north korea trade and tourism
<START> following existing tracks , this line would start at busan , south koreas second-largest city and one of the worlds busiest seaports
<START> train service would run through jejin and on into north korea , passing through the mount kumgang tourist zone and then wonsan , a weapons-industry hub converted into a beach resort
<START> the service would continue to hamhung , an industrial city and the second largest in north korea
<START> eventually , it would reach rason , an ice-free seaport close to north korean natural resources
<START> from there , travelers would go on to the russian border , where there are links to the russian seaport of vladivostok and beyond
<START> in theory , a train could continue to europe on whats been dubbed the iron silk railroad.
<START> south korean experts believe that this trade and tourism could help open up north korea politically
<START> at the same time , there is hope that such a connection could boost south koreas struggling economy and bring more business to the port of busan
<START> na hee-seung , the president of the korea railroad research institute , said that using container ships to send goods from busan to europe takes far too long for high-end goods
<START> freight rail would cost more but would take half the time , he said
<START> a railroad could also solidify relationships with neighbors , particularly russia
<START> artyom lukin , a political scientist at far eastern federal university in vladivostok , said russia has long seen an inter-korean connection to the trans-siberian railway as a way of extending its influence in the far east.
<START> russia expects to rake in profits , he said
<START> but not all are convinced
<START> anton vorobyev , an independent consultant who works with russians living in busan , said that discussions about an inter-korean railway have been going on for years but that the project does not go further than talking.
<START> certainly , it has been a long and painful process
<START> the two koreas first agreed to reconnect their rail systems in 2000 , but that was just the start of seven years of construction and negotiations
<START> a north korean train finally arrived in jejin on may 17 , 2007 , welcomed by cheering crowds
<START> but things soured quickly
<START> in 2008 , a north korean soldier fatally shot a south korean tourist who wandered into a restricted area in the mount kumgang resort , and the train service was shut down
<START> jejin station never received any passengers other than from that one test run in 2007
<START> given the large financial cost involved , restarting plans to reconnect the rail service is risky
<START> a complete renovation of north koreas railways could easily run into billions of dollars , with much of the cost borne by south korea
<START> recent visitors say that unlike south koreas world-class infrastructure , the norths once-lauded rail network is decrepit
<START> even near economic hubs such as rason , only painfully slow trains sharing single tracks are available , and delays stretch from hours to days
<START> ahn byung-min , a south korean railway expert who advises moons government , said he had not seen any improvements in north koreas trains in more than 40 visits since 2000.
<START> id say its got worse , he said
<START> some of his travel was on trains that reminded him of the runaway mine cart in the film indiana jones and the temple of doom , he said
<START> south koreans have sought ways to get the ball rolling
<START> on july 3 , song , the south korean politician , wrote directly to trump , pleading with him to lift u.s. sanctions on a project to connect the russian city of khasan to the port of rason in north korea
<START> as the project was already exempt from u.n. sanctions , he wrote , trump could remove u.s. sanctions unilaterally as a gesture of goodwill to pyongyang
<START> in north korea that denuclearization was worth it , song said
<START> he has not received a response to his letter , however
<START> said benjamin katzeff silberstein , co-editor of north korean economy watch
<START> there are signs that north korea is growing impatient
<START> rodong sinmun , the countrys most-read newspaper , published an article tuesday that accused seoul of taking reckless measures to comply with sanctions.
<START> said kim byeong-uk , an economist who fled north korea in 2002 and now heads a think tank in seoul
<START> north korea may ultimately decide instead to invest in special economic zones that would allow it to earn hard currency while avoiding greater outside scrutiny , he said
<START> but near jejin railway station , that doesnt matter many feel that something long-delayed is finally arriving
<START> kim jung-ja , the real estate agent , said that in 2007 , the rundown local area was buzzing with excitement about the train line
<START> now , once again , she was receiving calls from property speculators looking to buy
<START> any problems would lie with the united states , which was being too tough on north korea , kim jung-ja said.
<START> we live right here , she said of her towns proximity to the north.
<START> were not afraid at all.
