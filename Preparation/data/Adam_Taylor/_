<START> at a recent political event , marama davidson , co-leader of new zealands opposition green party , decided to take aim at a c-word that had been used to threaten and belittle female politicians by using the word repeatedly in public
<START> the c-word , davidson said at a rally against racism in auckland on friday
<START> they call us women c -- -s. c -- -s are powerful , she continued , drawing cheers
<START> the c-word in question is generally used to refer to female genitalia or , alternatively , an unpleasant or stupid person , according to the oxford english dictionary
<START> though it is a long-established word with neutral origins , it has been considered vulgar since at least 1785 , according to research by kate burridge , professor of linguistics at monash university in australia
<START> the term is widely considered among the most taboo swearwords , though its use and interpretation varies in different countries
<START> in late may , comedian samantha bee used the word on her tbs show full frontal to refer to ivanka trump , the daughter of the president , during a monologue about the trump administrations immigration crackdown
<START> after the white house complained that her language was vile and vicious , bee apologized for using the word.
<START> i crossed a line , and i deeply regret it , she said
<START> but there has also been an attempt recently especially among women , who are often the target of the word when its used as an insult to reclaim it
<START> actress sally field was among those who criticized bee for using the word , not because it was vulgar , but because it was powerful , beautiful , nurturing and honest.
<START> davidsons comments have caused a stir in new zealand politics , with a number of other female politicians refusing to stand by her use of the word
<START> prime minister jacinda ardern , who recently returned to work after giving birth on june 21 , said she wouldnt use the word herself
<START> and opposition politician paula bennett , deputy leader of the national party , has also criticized davidsons use of the word , saying it was disgusting to use it in front of children
<START> to do this in front of families and children is disgusting
<START> you may want to reclaim the word but you should not use your privileged position to decide for parents that their children should hear u repeatedly say it
<START> there is no excuse for bad manners
<START> davidsons use of the word may have some support , however
<START> though polls show the word is considered among the most offensive by new zealanders , miriam meyerhoff , a linguistics professor at victoria university in wellington , told newshub that the younger generation seems to be more accepting
<START> meyerhoff told the local news outlet
<START> davidson also said she had the support of her husband , whom she saw on thursday for the first time since the incident
<START> saying that he had affectionately called her the c-word , she added , i love him.
