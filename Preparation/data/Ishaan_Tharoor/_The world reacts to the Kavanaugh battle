the battle over the confirmation of supreme court nominee brett m. kavanaugh has roiled the country and yet again highlighted the depth of polarization in american society
kavanaugh , a federal judge in washington who is a longtime favorite of conservative activists , has been accused of sexual misconduct by three different women
both he and christine blasey ford , who says kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school , delivered emotional testimony about her allegations before the senate judiciary committee last week
that hearing has become a grim political rorschach test
many republican politicians and trump supporters saw a furious and sometimes tearful kavanaugh as the true victim fords supporters contrasted her measured but searing testimony against what they saw as the histrionics and lies of her alleged attacker
that mirrored the broadly partisan split in public opinion over kavanaughs fitness for the court and the credibility of the accusations
a final senate vote on his confirmation is expected later this week after a short fbi investigation into those claims
judge kavanaugh showed america exactly why i nominated him
his testimony was powerful , honest , and riveting
democrats search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay , obstruct , and resist
the senate must vote
but its not just americans who have been watching
my colleague siobhan ogrady charted the international response to thursdays hearing , which was beamed across the world
guardian columnist jonathan freedland saw in kavanaughs defense the same toxic masculinity as that of president trump , philippine president rodrigo duterte who jokes about rape and other right-wing populists around the world
he also reckoned that a cross-party consensus in accra would have nixed the candidacy of such a politically compromised judge
the perils of politicization have been hanging over the supreme court for years , culminating in the republicans success in preventing president barack obama from filling the vacancy left by the death of justice antonin scalia , a conservative icon
the bitter , existential nature of these fights has led many to call for reforms to the court , including the imposition of term limits
thats a practice widely used in other parts of the world
noted my colleague rick noack earlier this year.
german judges are replaced after 12-year tenures or when they turn 68 , whichever comes first
their swiss counterparts must resign at the same age and need to be reelected every six years
similar rules are in place in norway , italy and the united kingdom
of course , the polarization of the country is the actual cause of this mounting sense of crisis
the republican refusal to jettison kavanaugh whose testimony hardly strengthened his case in favor of any number of less problematic nominees has underscored the tribal animus that has wholly captured american politics
to those conservatives who are willing to look away from kavanaughs bizarre , evasive , immature , intemperate , weaselly , disrespectful answers to the senate , thats not conservative , thats just tribal loyalty over prudence and principle
wrote carsten luther of germanys zeit newspaper.
it was not about taking the alleged victim of a sexual assault seriously while maintaining the presumption of innocence against the alleged perpetrator until the opposite could be proved
power and the fear of losing it were the motivations for the spectacle , which , playing out over hours , showed what divides this country
