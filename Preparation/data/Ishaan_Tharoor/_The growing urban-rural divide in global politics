tuesday was another election day in the united states , and the marquee showdown was a special election in ohios 12th congressional district
at the time of writing , the race was still too close to call
but the theme of the results was clear , no matter the winner
the district , which covers a swath of suburbs and rural areas near the state capital , columbus , has been solidly republican for more than three decades
it went decisively for president trump in 2016
but this year , turnout surged in suburban areas and propelled democratic challenger danny oconnor to a virtual tie with his gop opponent , troy balderson
wrote the new york times.
if they do not , their house majority will slip away.
it 's hard to lose $ $ betting on a widening urban/rural divide this year
geography , as the saying goes , is destiny even more so in an era of deepening political polarization
and trumps america is hardly alone in this phenomenon
when trump went to poland last year and delivered a speech in warsaws krasinski square , the jubilant crowd cheering his blood-and-soil rhetoric was by and large not from the capital
the ruling law and justice party had bused in thousands of supporters from outlying parts of the country , including towns and villages along polands border with slovakia
warsaw residents are far more likely to protest the pis , as the illiberal party is known , as they did last month during massive demonstrations against government moves to subvert polands judiciary
in turkey , a similar dynamic has long been at work
president recep tayyip erdogan counts on pious conservative voters in the anatolian hinterland to overwhelm his secular and left-leaning opponents , who live disproportionately in the countrys coastal cities
hungarys right-wing prime minister , viktor orban , at the helm of europes nationalist vanguard , is far less popular in budapest than elsewhere in his country
the push for brexit and the electoral gains of the far right in france and germany all required the mobilization of voters living outside major urban centers
on one hand , theres nothing particularly new about the urban-rural divide
modern politics have been historically shaped by the tensions between the dynamism of cities and the relative stasis of the provinces , hidebound by feudalism and poverty
town and country divisions and the cultural enmities they foster stretch back to antiquity
but the inexorable urbanization of the world means that cities are , more than ever , the center of gravity in global politics , culture and the economy
in many democratic european societies that shift has bred marginalization and resentment
my colleague rick noack wrote following trumps election victory
he made a map showing the extent to which major european cities have grown as the communities around them shrank
in the united states , a major survey conducted by pew this year found that where you live shapes how you see the world
residents of diverse cities naturally embrace different positions than those in more homogeneous parts of the country
in european parliamentary democracies , the segment of the population animated chiefly by anti-immigrant fears usually gets relegated to a junior seat at the table
but in americas antiquated system of gerrymandered districts and the electoral college , less-densely populated parts of the country are favored over denser ones a political reality crucial to trumps victory
its a dynamic , wilkinson argues , that is toxic for american democracy in the long run
the skewed political map explains how trump a poster child for gilded metropolitan privilege can gain traction by launching nativist attacks on cities as abodes of both immigrant crime and globalist excess
and it masks the extent to which the collective story of america of both its glories and its inequities is an increasingly urban one
of course , the story can also be markedly different
the vast urban , middle-class support behind indias right-wing nationalist prime minister , narendra modi , shows that cities arent always crucibles of liberalism
rachman also points to moments when the urban middle-classes in countries like egypt , brazil and thailand have backed military coups over populist democratic politics
