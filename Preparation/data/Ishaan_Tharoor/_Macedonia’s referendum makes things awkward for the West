on sunday , europes most bizarre geopolitical dispute nearly ended
for close to three decades , greece and macedonia had feuded over the latters name
greeks said that macedonia , which is also the name of a region in northern greece , represented a culture and history that rightfully belonged to them
they expressed their displeasure by barring macedonias path to membership in both the european union and nato
then , this summer , the two countries struck a potentially historic deal the smaller country would rename itself north macedonia , and greece would drop its objections to bringing its neighbor into the e.u
and nato fold
macedonian voters went to the polls sunday to vote on a referendum that would approve the agreement
but while the results overwhelmingly endorsed the compromise with greece , only about a third of eligible voters cast a ballot
that fell short of the required 50 percent turnout that prime minister zoran zaev leader of the yes campaign had hoped would confer popular legitimacy on the move
zaev hailed the votes success , but he now faces an uncertain fight with the opposition in parliament
referendum in i congratulate those citizens who voted in today 's consultative referendum and made use of their democratic freedoms
with the very significant yes vote , there is broad support support to the prespa agreement + to the country 's euroatlantic path
we encourage skopje to seize this historic opportunity
read my joint statement with eucopresident on the consultative referendum in
the low turnout was seen as a blow not only to the efforts of the yes camp , but also its vociferous backers in brussels , berlin and washington
over the past month , a train of european dignitaries , including german chancellor angela merkel and nato secretary general jens stoltenberg , came through skopje , the macedonian capital , urging voters to seize a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
former u.s. president george w. bush , who called for macedonias entrance into nato in 2008 , released a letter last week beseeching macedonians to write a new and more hopeful story for their country
instead , the vote in macedonia underscored broader divisions across europe and the ambivalence many people feel about its major institutions
a center-right , nationalist opposition party pushed a boycott of the vote , and the countrys president , gjeorge ivanov , had suggested the name change would amount to historical suicide
in remarks made on monday , ivanov said the silent majority had decided , echoing rhetoric once used by president trump
he then directly referred to trumps speech at the united nations last week , where the american president once more thumbed his nose at the liberalism of the international community
a few days ago , said ivanov , u.s. president donald trump said freedom , peace and democracy are possible only in sovereign and independent countries
yesterday the macedonian people showed sovereign will
evelyn farkas , a senior fellow at the atlantic council and a former state department official who worked on the balkans , said the boycott could be interpreted as a sour grapes moment for zaevs opponents , many of whom are pro-e.u
and would have few qualms backing the referendum in a different political context
but the partisan bickering in skopje may have exposed a deeper dysfunction
whats at stake is not simply whether macedonia gets into nato or the e.u
but its also a potential vote of confidence in those institutions and democracy , farkas said in a phone call with reporters
this outcome thankfully is not an out-and-out negative outcome
but it does raise a lot of questions and red flags
as my colleague michael birnbaum reported , one of the major questions has been the extent of russian influence
in the weeks before the referendum , western officials complained of alleged kremlin attempts to boost campaigns to suppress the vote
on a visit to skopje last month
defense secretary jim mattis warned of russian influence efforts
in july , a group of rowdy soccer fans said they had been paid to stir up violence at protests against the deal
and greece barred four russian diplomats from the country for what leaders there said were efforts to foment nationalist opposition to prime minister alexis tsiprass willingness to make a compromise with skopje
the u.s. welcomes the results of the republic of macedonias sept 30 referendum
we strongly support the agreements full implementation , allowing macedonia to take its place in nato and the eu , contributing to regional stability , security , & prosperity
the murky geopolitics of the moment loom over a complicated history
the dispute between greece and macedonia has been in effect ever since the latter broke away from what was then yugoslavia in 1991
greece saw an independent state with the same name as the region in its north as an implicit territorial threat
it slapped a trade embargo on the fledgling nation in the 1990s and blocked macedonias entrance into a host of international organizations , including a 2008 veto of macedonias bid to join nato
sticking points in the dispute involve an emotional tussle over the legacy of the ancient macedonian conqueror , alexander the great , whom both countries claim as part of their national heritage
zaevs decision this year to change the name of his countrys major airport once skopje alexander the great airport was a necessary confidence-building measure that paved the way for his agreement with tsipras this summer
but symbolism cant compensate for the pitfalls of governance
bloomberg views leonid bershidsky noted that zaevs gambit obscures his countrys stagnation and brain drain
along with the boycott , a cocktail of local frustrations helped fuel the low turnout on sunday
the hopes that have arisen for the region this year arent dead , but it will take more than the prospect of eu and nato membership to produce specific solutions to long-standing problems , bershidsky wrote
patient political maneuvering , better day-to-day economic management , and cautious diplomacy are still the western balkans best chance
