in april 2002 , then-venezuelan president hugo chvez was briefly deposed in a coup attempt launched by mutinous army officers
but within 48 hours , chvez surged back to power with the aid of loyalist generals and masses of supporters who marched in the streets in his defense
it emerged later that the cia had knowledge of the coup plot , despite the george w. bush administration 's vociferous denials at the time
there were documented links between washington and anti-government figures involved in the botched ouster
the specter of yanqui imperialism loomed once more
chvez , a fiery demagogue , made hay of those revelations , linking his own ordeal to a wider american legacy of dirty wars , election interference and military interventions
having a government of this type in the united states is a threat to the world , he declared
sixteen years later , it can be plausibly argued that the government chvez bequeathed to venezuela is a threat to the world
years of mismanagement and cronyism have hollowed out the venezuelan economy , triggering mind-boggling hyperinflation and devastating food and medicine shortages
a hemispheric humanitarian calamity is now straining venezuela 's neighbors , who are struggling to cope with the vast influx of refugees fleeing hunger and depredation

for more than a year , analysts have suggested that chvez 's successor , nicols maduro , could be vulnerable to a coup
maduro and his allies have withstood several murky attacks from renegade soldiers , including an apparent assassination attempt with an explosive-laden drone during a military parade last month
but rather than losing his grip on power , maduro has only tightened it , purging the military 's ranks of potential threats and winning reelection in votes largely considered fraudulent by the international community
all the while , he keeps blaming outside actors chiefly , the united states for his nation 's woes
and this weekend , he got even more fuel for his paranoia
according to my colleagues , officials from the trump administration met several times with venezuelan military officers who claimed to be coup-plotting dissenters
the venezuelans requests for covert aid were ultimately rebuffed , not least because the americans were hardly convinced by their entreaties
we had very little confidence in the ability of these people to do anything , no idea at all about who they represented , and to what extent they had not exposed themselves already , one official told my colleagues
but the new details , reported first by the new york times , were more than enough for maduro 's government
we denounce before the world the united states intervention plans and help to military conspirators against venezuela , tweeted jorge arreaza , venezuela 's foreign minister
the white house rushed to subdue speculation that it wants to intervene
we condemn trump 's coup conspiracy by holding secret meetings with venezuelan military traitors to overthrow our brother nicols maduro
the free countries of latin america will withstand and defeat any further attacks of the empire against the peace and democracy in the region
of course , such a return is nowhere in sight
president trump , meanwhile , has played the part of the hectoring american hegemon rather well
his administration included venezuela among the mostly muslim-majority countries targeted by trump 's travel ban , shutting the door to a nation in desperate need
he has touted the military option for venezuela rhetoric that sent sirens ringing on a continent all too familiar with american interventions
and reports indicate that trump floated the possibility of an invasion not only to his top advisers , but to leaders of other latin american countries
but even were such an adventure now in the works , the new revelations suggest that washington 's allies on the ground would be woefully out of their depth
the main request of the military plotters was encrypted radios , which they planned to use to communicate among themselves in order to capture mr. maduro and his lieutenants , noted the times
but the united states never granted the request , and after multiple meetings , the venezuelans became frustrated
mr. maduros government has since jailed dozens of the conspirators , though many remain at large
the irony of the moment is that trump himself is careening down a dark path even as his administration puzzles over how to confront a destructive and destabilizing regime in venezuela
trump fulminated over threats to his rule posed , in part , by an anonymous insider who penned an astonishing op-ed on how trump aides are protecting the country from the presidents consistently bad instincts
hes remarkable in his lack of appreciation for democratic values and institutions
and i think thats where some of the greatest damage is being done , sen. bob corker ( r-tenn. ) told cnn 's manu raju last week
left to his own accord , our country would look somewhat like venezuela
