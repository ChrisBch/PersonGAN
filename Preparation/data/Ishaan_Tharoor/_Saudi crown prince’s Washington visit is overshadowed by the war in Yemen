saudi arabia 's crown prince , mohammed bin salman , called on president trump on tuesday afternoon and it was all smiles in the oval office
the president made his usual complaints about iran while sitting alongside the crown prince , an inveterate tehran foe , and he bluntly celebrated $ 12.5 billion in finalized arms sales to the saudis
the pair grinned as they examined a poster outlining some of the american weaponry on riyadh 's shopping list
but a storm was brewing on capitol hill
a bipartisan group of senators attempted to force a vote on a bill that would curb american support for the saudi-led military intervention in yemen , as well as asserting more broad congressional oversight of america 's wars
successive presidents have entered new conflicts without congressional approval , invoking the powers granted to them by lawmakers after the sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorism attacks
now , a decade and a half later , some of those lawmakers are citing the saudi campaign against yemen 's houthi rebels as a good place to start reining in the president 's mandate
after hours of debate , opponents of the legislation narrowly won a vote to table the resolution , effectively killing it for the time being
still , it was a sign to the saudis , who have placed all their eggs in the trump administration 's basket , that not all of washington is on their side
gut check moment for the senate today we will vote on whether to continue the u.s./saudi bombing campaign in yemen which has killed over 10,000 civilians and created the largest cholera outbreak in history
mohammad happens to be the main architect of riyadh 's war in yemen , which it launched in 2015 alongside a coalition of regional allies
the suffering in the three years since has been hideous , and the toll is still difficult to measure
aid agencies estimate that at least 5,100 civilians have been killed , though the actual figure could be more than double that number
about 22 million yemenis more than two-thirds of the population are in need of humanitarian aid 8.4 million yemenis , or about a third of the population , are believed to be on the brink of famine
the catastrophic conditions in yemen spawned the worst cholera outbreak in modern history and an ongoing outbreak of diphtheria
there is plenty of blame to go around
but the saudis , as allies of the west and self-styled agents of regional stability , deserve to be singled out for particular criticism
the saudi coalition has bombed yemen more than 16,000 times over the past three years , with about one-third of the strikes hitting non-civilian targets
rights groups and u.n. experts allege that the saudi coalition could be guilty of war crimes
meanwhile , riyadh 's blockade of yemen 's ports has in part provoked the staggering shortages of food , medicines and basic goods that have contributed to the collapse of yemen 's already enfeebled state infrastructure
the saudis argue that their campaign is required to check iran , which backs the houthis , and bring order to a strategically pivotal country on their southern flank
they also point to efforts theyve made both to alleviate yemeni suffering with humanitarian aid and better protect civilians
as my colleagues reported , some trump administration officials agree that the saudis must push back against iran
other analysts in washington argue that three years of bloodshed and chaos have only played further into iran 's hands
defense secretary jim mattis wrote in a letter last week to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ) , another opponent of the legislation
i 'm deeply disappointed that congress again abdicated its constitutional duty to authorize war
over and over , congress has sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as administrations have misled us into conflicts , including vietnam and iraq , with disastrous consequences
the truth about yemen is that u.s. forces have been actively engaged in support of the saudi coalition in this war , providing intelligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this humanitarian crisis far worse
administration officials also attempted to suggest that u.s. support for the saudi-led coalition which includes intelligence-sharing , refueling support for coalition aircraft and the supplying of munitions found to have allegedly killed yemeni civilians does not constitute direct involvement in hostilities
that is a claim met with disbelief by critics
meanwhile , mohammed is being courted in washington by u.s. arms companies hoping to sell tens of thousands of precision-guided weapons to both the saudis and the emiratis
yet trump said next to nothing about yemen during the their meeting , let alone the prospect of bringing the war to an end
most analysts suggest theres no military solution to the conflict , which involves a thicket of factions with competing interests and tangled allegiances
