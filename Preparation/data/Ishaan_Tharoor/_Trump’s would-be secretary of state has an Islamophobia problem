mike pompeo , the cia director who was tapped by president trump to lead the state department , faces a confirmation hearing before the senate foreign relations committee on thursday
for the white house , it could n't come sooner
but pompeo has had to prepare himself for a tough fight
although republicans hold a narrow 11-to-10 majority in the committee , he 'll probably need a degree of bipartisan support to win the committee 's approval
libertarian sen. rand paul ( r-ky. ) has indicated his probable opposition to pompeo over his support of the iraq war , and tolerance of waterboarding and other forms of torture
democrats are n't going to be in a forgiving mood , either
they are expected to grill pompeo on contentious issues thursday
those include his defense of practices tantamount to torture his climate-change denial his opposition to equal rights for lgbt americans and state department programs aimed at promoting gender equality abroad and his eagerness to scrap the nuclear deal brokered with iran
i voted yes on pompeo for cia on the theory that he would be the adult in the room.
i was wrong
i am voting no on pompeo for secretary of state because our top diplomat should believe in diplomacy
he has an alarming tendency towards military provocation and brinkmanship
even if the committee fails to approve pompeo 's nomination , he could still get the job thanks to the geopolitical urgency of the moment
as rogin reported , his confirmation could , no matter the committee 's decision , be brought to the full senate for a floor vote , where he stands a better chance of winning
the prospect of pompeo 's ascension to the top rungs of the u.s. foreign-policy apparatus set off alarm bells across washington
critics worry that between pompeo and new national security adviser john bolton , trump is assembling a war cabinet that will stoke his most volatile and hawkish instincts
sen. chris murphy ( d-conn. ) , a member of the foreign relations committee , said to reporters tuesday.
it could do real damage to our national security.
in addition to pompeo 's potential hawkishness , critics are worried about pompeo 's troubling track record on religion and intimate association with the islamophobic fringe in america
of course , in the era of trump 's divisive populism , anti-muslim voices are closer to the mainstream than probably ever
but pompeo was an early adopter
the former tea party congressman from kansas built up his profile as a right-wing hard-liner
in 2013 , after the boston marathon bombing , pompeo took to the house floor and complained that muslims were allegedly not denouncing terrorism
numerous american muslim organizations and leaders had in fact issued statements condemning the bombing , conducted vigils and worked to support victims of the attack
but pompeo was undeterred
pompeo said at the time , a statement that implicitly cast suspicion on a good chunk of america 's muslim population
in 2014 and 2015 , pompeo spearheaded legislation to designate the muslim brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization
that might not seem so outlandish a proposition in 2018 the islamist party is outlawed in countries such as egypt and reviled by the monarchies of the arab gulf
but the campaign for this designation in the united states has no support from a wide spectrum of mainstream counterterrorism analysts
it is deeply connected to the efforts of a fringe set of hate groups that see american muslims as a fifth column bent on subverting the state
one of those organizations , act for america , awarded pompeo its highest honor , the national security eagle award , in 2016
pompeo also frequently appeared on radio shows with frank gaffney , another leading islamophobe who spuriously accused various democrats of clandestine ties to the muslim brotherhood
during one 2015 episode featuring pompeo , gaffney went on a rant about president barack obama , suggesting he had an affinity for islamist militants
pompeo has embarked on a diligent listening tour , gauging the concerns of his colleagues and even reaching out to moderate democrats such as hillary clinton , whom he once deemed morally reprehensible.
but critics say that pompeo 's rise to the top is part of a dangerous phenomenon the normalization of anti-muslim sentiment in the republican party
an investigation published this week by buzzfeed news found dozens of examples of state and local republican politicians in virtually every u.s. state attacking islam
