gabriel d. conde , 22 , was a child when his nation invaded afghanistan in 2001
this week he became the latest american casualty in the ongoing war there
according to pentagon officials , conde was hit by enemy gunfire while participating in a counterterrorism mission in a district east of kabul , making him the second american service member killed in afghanistan this year
more than 2,400 americans have died during the war , as well as tens of thousands of afghan civilians
afghanistan 's chronic insecurity and the inability of the country 's political leaders and their international backers to broker a lasting peace was on gruesome display over the past 10 days
while conde was on his ill-fated deployment , twin bombings in kabul killed 31 people , including 10 journalists
a week prior , a suicide bomber detonated his explosives outside a voter registration center in the city , killing at least 57 people and raising anxieties over the viability of upcoming elections
this follows a year in which suicide attacks doubled and sectarian attacks tripled in afghanistan
this week also marked seven years since the united states killed osama bin laden , the al-qaeda mastermind whose attacks provoked the 2001 intervention against the taliban
but for all the blood spilled , money spent and bombs dropped , washington looks no closer to finding a way out
though president trump resents the drain on manpower and resources that the war represents , his administration committed more than 15,000 troops to the country in a bid to help the flagging afghan government
but , as my colleague pamela constable reported , there is little sign of progress
a new pentagon report showed that the ranks of the afghan military and police forces , which u.s. troops are tasked to support and train , are dwindling
the paper also detailed how billions of dollars in american aid have been squandered , the toll of widespread and rampant corruption in the country , and the extent to which the government in kabul is floundering
that 's an unfortunate conclusion in the best of times
under president trump , who has shown little interest in the hard diplomacy needed to stabilize the country , it sounds even worse
analysts argue that further pressure needs to be exerted on regional powers such as pakistan , whose notorious inter-services intelligence , a military spy agency , has long abetted militancy across the afghan border
but trump and his lieutenants are more inclined to swagger on the international stage than stay humble
trump has championed american hard power and his ability to launch punitive missile strikes on enemy targets , be they militant redoubts in afghanistan or the airfields of the syrian regime
under his watch , coalition forces unleashed a relentless air campaign against the islamic state , pulverizing the iraqi city of mosul and the syrian city of raqqa
months later , volunteers are still digging bodies out of the rubble , while rights groups point to an untallied civilian death toll that may number in the hundreds , perhaps thousands
though the administration declared the end of major combat operations in iraq ( again ) this week , the battle to win the peace may be the tougher fight
in congress , trump 's bellicosity has sped a bipartisan effort to curtail the president 's war powers
but critics of the proposed legislation warn this is a misguided endeavor that may actually grant trump greater freedom to enter new conflicts
meanwhile , ordinary afghans continue to live and die in the shadow of an endless american war
shah marai , agence france-presse 's chief photographer in kabul , wrote in a blog post in 2016
what hope he had for his country after the toppling of the taliban government vanished in the face of a brutal insurgency that fed off the american occupation and local misgovernance
on the day that conde , the young american soldier , was slain , marai was one of the journalists killed in kabul by a suicide bomber
