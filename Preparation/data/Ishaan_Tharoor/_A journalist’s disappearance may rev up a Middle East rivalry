we still do not know what has happened to jamal khashoggi
the saudi journalist , who has contributed numerous articles to the washington posts global opinions section , has not been seen since he entered the saudi consulate in istanbul on tuesday afternoon to finalize papers regarding a divorce
khashoggi is a prominent commentator , familiar to a generation of middle east correspondents seeking insight into the intrigues of riyadh
in recent years , he had turned into a critic of the kingdoms leadership and relocated to washington in a kind of self-imposed exile
but saudi officials deny they have detained the journalist , claiming in an emailed statement to my colleagues that khashoggi is not in the building
we were going to marry this week , said khashoggis fiancee , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , to my colleagues in istanbul on wednesday
she added that her spouse-to-be had been concerned about going to the consulate.
of course he was worried
how comfortable can one be if he is not liked by his country
said the posts international opinions editor , eli lopez , in a statement thursday.
we are monitoring the situation closely , trying to gather more information
it would be unfair and outrageous if he has been detained for his work as a journalist and commentator
saudi news channel breaks silence about disappearance of renowned dissident jkhashoggi to repeat official linebroadcaster saudi authorities are coordinating efforts to uncover whereabouts of khashoggi who disappeared after leaving saudi consulate
wrote elliott abrams , a former official in the george w. bush administration
abrams warned that the reputation of the current saudi government will be harmed irreparably.
such detentions have become more conspicuous under the kingdoms young crown prince , mohammed bin salman
since taking de facto power in a shake-up last year , mohammed has detained feminist activists and billionaire magnates alike
saudi authorities even briefly held the sitting lebanese prime minister in a riyadh hotel last year
all of this came as mohammed promised to open up saudi arabias conservative society and wean itself off of oil dependence
the crown prince , rezaian noted , is a frequent target of khashoggis columns.
at each turning point
jamal has offered readers of the post insightful commentary and sharp criticism about the seemingly impenetrable country , he wrote
the geopolitical backdrop to khashoggis disappearance is worth considering
turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has presided over a sweeping purge of the countrys civil society and government ever since a botched coup attempt in 2016
yet turkey has also become something of a sanctuary for arab dissidents of various stripes
in 2013 , after a military coup unseated egyptian president mohamed morsi and brutally crushed his muslim brotherhood , a host of egyptian dissidents and islamist politicians took up residence in istanbul
erdogan remains a staunch critic of egyptian president abdel fattah al-sissi , the former army officer who ousted morsi
thats a position welcomed by erdogan , who once hoped his brand of religiously tinged democratic politics would be embraced by the arab world
instead , his rule has grown more autocratic , and the middle east has been consumed by a series of wars and bitter geopolitical disputes
that includes the standoff between the saudis , emiratis and their allies on one side and qatar on the other
turkey flew troops and food supplies into qatar last year and still maintains a military base in doha
meanwhile , the qataris pledged to inject $ 15 billion worth of investment in turkeys flagging economy in august
some analysts read ankaras moves coupled with erdogans overtures to iran over the past year as a riposte to the emergence of a u.s.-backed middle east bloc including the saudis , emiratis and even israel
were very concerned about jamal kashoggi , a washpost contributor missing after visiting the saudi consulate in istanbul
is kidnapping leading journalists mbss idea of reform
amid the chaos of the regions politics , khashoggi urged the kingdom conduct itself with ethics and dignity and therefore called on saudi arabia to draw down its war in yemen
