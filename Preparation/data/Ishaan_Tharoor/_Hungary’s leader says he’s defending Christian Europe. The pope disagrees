as expected , right-wing hungarian prime minister viktor orban won a third consecutive term on sunday
his ruling fidesz party secured more than two-thirds of the seats in parliament , a decisive mandate that many observers consider an ominous sign for the future of democracy in hungary and even the rest of europe
orban ran a stridently anti-immigrant campaign , fixating on the phantom menace of muslim migrants and refugees overwhelming hungary
he repeatedly styled himself as the defender of europe 's traditional christian identity , likening an anti-migrant fence he erected on hungary 's southern border to the ramparts of western civilization
and he cast his enemies , both abroad and at home , as agents of an alien threat
but there 's one actual leader of european christendom who probably vehemently disagrees with orban
on monday , as the hungarian leader basked in his victory , pope francis issued an apostolic exhortation on the subject of holiness
his message centered on the importance of caring for migrants , with the pope arguing that their plight should be as important to catholics as their opposition to abortion
i wish to repropose the call to holiness rejoice and be glad
haidari said in response to the pope 's new message
as european politicians have turned to scaremongering over migrants , francis has been conspicuous with his open-armed embrace of refugees
he bathed the feet of asylum-seekers from sub-saharan africa in 2016 and transported a group of displaced syrians in his own plane
those actions , along with his strong stance on refugees , have gained the pontiff a legion of critics among the far right and even within more conservative circles at the vatican
he has also had awkward dealings with clergy members in hungary and poland , both historically catholic nations with right-wing nationalist governments that practice virtually the opposite of what the pope seems to preach
orban , though , did not risk a war of words with the head of the roman church
instead , he made jewish american philanthropist george soros , who has invested in promoting civil society and democracy in his native hungary , into public enemy number one
orban said that soros aimed to strike a final blow to christian culture through his support for greater pluralism and compassion toward migrants
anti-soros messaging suffused the election campaign , which international monitors declared was significantly compromised by the ruling party 's overweening control over state television and even some commercial broadcasters
for his hard-line agenda which reeked of anti-semitism orban was swiftly congratulated by the doyens of western europe 's far right , who also oppose both muslim immigration and the european union 's fitful efforts to respond to the syrian refugee crisis
these included italian ultranationalist giorgia meloni , anti-islam dutch politician geert wilders and french far-right leader marine le pen , who hailed orban 's victory as a rejection of brussels
even german interior minister horst seehofer , who has said islam has no place in his country , urged his liberal colleagues to drop their arrogance and condescension toward orban in the wake of the election result
congratulations viktor orbn with this excellent result
a well deserved victory
with another term now in hand , orban has become one of the continent 's most potent illiberal demagogues , bending the state to his favor and eroding the country 's fledgling democratic norms
now his critics fear bigger moves to silence opposition to his rule
marta pardavi , the co-chair of the hungarian helsinki committee , a human rights group that works with migrants , said to mcauley

dirty rat written on taxpayer funded govt ad on disgusting nat'l consultation hate campaign against soros
not unlike the nationalist grandstanding of autocrats in russia and turkey whose politics orban claims to admire the hungarian prime minister has used a culture war to entrench his rule
at home , his anti-immigrant , anti-e.u
sentiments helped him outflank the formerly neo-fascist jobbik party on the right
abroad , they helped him link up with leaders elsewhere in eastern and central europe to build support for his defense of europe 's christian identity and his attack on what he famously called the era of liberal babble.
but his vision of christendom is not shared in rome , where the pope seems to have an inconvenient fondness for at least some liberal babble.
in his exhortation , francis pointed to how welcoming the stranger was fundamental to the catholic faith , not a a momentary fad that happened to be invented by some pope.
the pope wrote , but not a christian.
