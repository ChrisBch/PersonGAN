saudi arabia 's crown prince , mohammed bin salman , arrives in washington on monday to kick off a two-and-a-half week visit to the united states
it 's hardly his first trip to america , but it will certainly be the most momentous
within the space of a few years , the 32-year-old prince has installed himself as saudi arabia 's surprise heir apparent , purging senior relatives from the line of succession and cowing other rivals
most observers already see mohammed bin salman often referred to by his initials , mbs as the de facto ruler of the kingdom , simply waiting for the moment his aging father , king salman , chooses to move aside
in myriad conversations with western media , mohammed bin salman presents himself as a young man in a hurry , shaking up a country whose leadership is better known for its caution and conservatism
he has already made dramatic social changes women will soon have the right to drive , movie theaters are opening up and the powers of the once-ubiquitous religious police are being curbed
he also spearheaded a sweeping purge of elites that targeted supposedly corrupt officials and tycoons while further consolidating his own grip on power
the crown prince told my colleague david ignatius last month
the washington post 's editorial page asked last week , referring to dozens of political prisoners still behind bars
but mohammed bin salman 's defenders urge patience as he gets to work
the prince is indeed playing a risky game
his domestic moves have won widespread plaudits in washington and elsewhere , but his actions overseas have proved far more controversial
when mohammed meets with president trump at the white house on tuesday , they 'll probably see eye-to-eye on iran , riyadh 's longtime foe and trump 's geopolitical bete noir
reports indicate that the trump administration will probably pull out of the nuclear deal with iran in may , possibly triggering a confrontation with the islamic republic that would be cheered in saudi arabia
beyond that , things get trickier
mohammed is the architect of a devastating saudi-led intervention in yemen , which has contributed to a horrific humanitarian crisis and prompted growing criticism on capitol hill
he also helped trigger the ongoing persian gulf crisis with qatar apparently with carte blanche from the white house that has largely backfired , doing little to boost saudi prestige and exposing profound splits within the trump administration
and he 'll have to reckon with trump over the zombie state of the israeli-palestinian peace process , a situation made all the worse by trump 's recognition publicly opposed by riyadh of jerusalem as israel 's capital
then theres the dilemma posed by trump
after clashing with president barack obama , the saudis were conspicuous cheerleaders when trump came to power
the crown prince is said to have built a close relationship with jared kushner , trumps son-in-law and jack-of-all-trades adviser
but with kushner at the center of overlapping scandals and every day in the white house seemingly an exercise in chaos , there 's a chance the saudis are depending too much on one person
