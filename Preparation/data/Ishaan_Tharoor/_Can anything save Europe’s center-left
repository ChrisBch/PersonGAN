in the cold light of day , things do not look much better for italy 's political establishment
after voters delivered astonishing mandates to two populist parties on sunday , the biggest losers seemed to be matteo renzi and silvio berlusconi , the two former prime ministers who led italy 's once-dominant center-left and center-right blocs
they knew their parties would struggle but not as badly as this
berlusconi was overshadowed by far-right leader matteo salvini , whose anti-immigrant , anti-european union party the league would now be the senior partner in any potential right-wing coalition
renzi saw his democratic party win less than 20 percent of the vote , hemorrhaging support to parties such as the anti-establishment five star movement , which emerged as italy 's single strongest political force
at last , crowed luigi di maio , five star 's 31-year-old leader , the republic of italian citizens.
now italy 's dueling factions must take stock and enter what figure to be tumultuous coalition talks
a host of permutations are possible , including the aforementioned right-wing coalition or even an alliance between the ascendant populist parties.
either is likely to make europes establishment nauseous , my colleague michael birnbaum wrote
if salvini came to power , he would be western europes first far-right leader since 1945
di maio , meanwhile , questions european integration and rules that restrict free spending
no matter what , it seems like the end of the road for renzi
he emerged as a bold reformer and became italy 's youngest prime minister in 2014 , but stepped down in 2016 after failing to push through significant constitutional reforms he believed were necessary to revitalize the country
yet he refused to relinquish control of the party , even as infighting and defections further weakened him
now he limps off the stage , deflated and defeated
he said at a news conference.
we will never form a government with anti-system forces.
italy 's democratic party joins the growing ranks of europe 's flailing center-left parties , which have suffered several major defeats in countries where they were once political titans
the dutch labor party went from governance to irrelevance a year ago
france 's socialists party , in power at the beginning of 2017 , was decimated in parliamentary elections and captured just 6 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidential election
president emmanuel macron , an outsider centrist , has siphoned off much of the center-left 's support
and after months of fitful hand-wringing , germany 's social democrats agreed to forge another grand coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives an arrangement many on the german left fear has hollowed out the party
some center-left parties in the west have undergone a radical reckoning
britain 's labour party turned sharply left with the ascension of jeremy corbyn , an economic populist who has much in common with some of the anti-establishment cadres on the continent
tony blair , the pro-globalization prime minister who was once labour 's standard-bearer and savior , is a pariah within his own party corbyn has said blair should face charges for war crimes for his support of the u.s. invasion of iraq
but she has also echoed right-wing calls for limits on non-western immigration
or perhaps the easiest option is the one renzi has chosen sit and wait
the center-left in the west has struggled after spending years in power
glimmers of an economic revival under their watch were ignored by voters eager for more concrete change
now the forces aligned against them have their chance to govern and fail
there have been signs that parties such as the league and five star will be willing to moderate their positions as they move into the spotlight and are potentially compelled to make the compromises that come with being in power
