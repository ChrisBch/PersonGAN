cambridge analytica , a london-based data firm that sold its services to political campaigns , has been thrust into the spotlight this week thanks to a number of startling exposs
undercover footage , along with testimony and evidence provided by a former employee-turned-whistleblower , offered a glimpse of the company 's shadowy dealings around the world
it secretly harvested the data of tens of millions of facebook users and may have engaged in all sorts of offline skulduggery , including bribes and sexual blackmail , to help clients win elections
much of the american media has focused on cambridge analytica 's connections to the trump campaign and prominent figures in the american far right , including father-and-daughter financiers robert mercer and rebekah mercer and ultranationalist gadfly stephen k. bannon
to some observers , the revelations about the firm 's practices fit a broader narrative of foreign interference and manipulation into the 2016 u.s. election
but , as my colleague adam taylor explained , the company has arguably had a bigger impact in other parts of the world , often through front organizations that obscure its fingerprints
cambridge analytica claims to have worked in a wide range of countries , including australia , brazil , malaysia and mexico
reports suggest that 's nowhere near a complete list an affiliated company named scl group , which founded cambridge analytica in 2013 , had offices in asia and latin america and is known to have been involved in indian local elections in 2010
british broadcaster channel 4 news also aired undercover footage this week of the firm 's chief executive , alexander nix , and a colleague claiming they secretly ran the 2013 and 2017 election campaigns of kenyan president uhuru kenyatta
exclusive cambridge analytica bosses say they ran all the digital campaign for donald trump - including potentially illegal activities
of course , cambridge analytica is neither the first nor the only company to engage in these electoral dark arts
as long as there have been elections , there have been schemers and manipulators eager to help fix the results
nor is there reason to believe with any certainty that the company was instrumental in determining recent electoral outcomes , including president trump 's victory and the success of the brexit referendum
guardian columnist gaby hinsliff noted although she added that its aggressive mining of data may mark a tipping point.
a host of american political scientists are genuinely worried about this streak of american authoritarian feeling , which was weaponized by the trump campaign ( and possibly by cambridge analytica )
a new report from lee drutman , a senior fellow at new america , a washington think tank , warned that deepening polarization under trump is stoking authoritarian attitudes within his party
the unleashing of the inner demons identified by firms such as cambridge analytica could lead to a dramatic erosion of democracy
whats still hypothetical in the united states is all too real elsewhere
on thursday , the bertelsmann foundation , a respected german think tank , released its latest index of the health of democracy and governance in 129 developing-world countries
its findings , based on two years of research and data , were grim it saw growing social inequities and the curtailing of the rule of law and political freedoms in about 40 nations , including some countries with rather advanced democracies
its not clear the extent to which social media has exacerbated these growing fault lines
but such turmoil is fertile terrain for profit
anand giridharadas , the author of a forthcoming book on the delusions of silicon valley 's tech elites , pours scorn on the idea that facebook founder mark zuckerberg could possibly be a potential successor to trump
hopefully , we know better
but companies like cambridge analytica are betting that we do n't
