it was another embarrassing european visit for president trump , who traveled to paris on friday for ceremonies marking the 100th anniversary of the end of world war i
it might have been an easy opportunity to mend fences and honor the sacrifices of washingtons traditional allies
instead , trump only underscored the widening gulf between the united states and its european partners
before he even landed , trump provoked controversy by attacking french president emmanuel macron over comments macron made on international security
then , on saturday , trump skipped a planned visit to the aisne-marne american cemetery , which honors u.s. soldiers killed in the battle of belleau wood because of rain in paris
the decision sparked a furious reaction from american commentators and observers elsewhere , who said the bad weather should not have stopped trump from doing his duty
a host of other leaders and dignitaries , including canadian prime minister justin trudeau , braved the elements to pay their respects
on sunday , trump as well as russian president vladimir putin skipped a procession of dozens of world leaders , who walked together down the champs-elysees toward the arc de triomphe
the symbolism was not lost on the watching press
then , by that famous monument , macron delivered a pointed rebuke of trumps america first agenda
old demons are rising again
new ideologies are manipulating religions , and history is threatening to repeat its tragedies
let us vow once more as nations to ensure peace is the utmost priority , above all else , because we know what it cost
whatever bromance once existed between trump and his french counterpart has long faded , no matter a few polite tweets shared this weekend
trump withdrew from both the paris climate accord and the iran nuclear deal , ignoring macrons efforts to persuade him otherwise
he has cheered the rise of right-wing populists throughout europe , including domestic rivals of macron
meanwhile , the french president has consciously styled himself in opposition to trump
merkel said sunday , once more defending the post-world war ii international order that has guaranteed much of europe decades of peace and prosperity
on saturday , macron and merkel went to compiegne , where the armistice that ended world war i was signed and where hitler compelled frances surrender in 1940
at a site of national victory and defeat for both countries , they rallied for unity
but such an emotional scene may not quite reflect the spirit of the present
like macron , merkel has warned of europes need to strengthen itself collectively in the face of an unreliable united states
yet both leaders face stiff political tests at home
macrons approval ratings slumped to record lows in recent months
a poll last week placed macrons centrist ruling party behind the french far-right ahead of next years elections for the european parliament
and merkels announcement that she will not seek reelection as german chancellor was seen as a mark of the waning clout of liberal centrism on the continent
as both the far right and the left gather strength , european leaders are struggling to find common ground on issues ranging from monetary policy to immigration and how to confront the kremlin
divided one century ago , united today
thank you to every leader and guest who came to paris from all over the world this weekend to build peace
we will not be able to say to future generations that we didnt know
peace is our treasure and our responsability
as part of the pleasantries of the visit , macron declared his great solidarity with trump
but the true bond they share may simply be that of presidents fighting uphill battles
