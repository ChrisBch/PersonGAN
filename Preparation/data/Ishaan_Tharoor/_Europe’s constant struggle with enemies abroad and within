a series of far-right protests have roiled the eastern german city of chemnitz in recent weeks and shocked the rest of the nation
sparked by the fatal stabbing of a german national during an alleged brawl with migrants , the demonstrations featured hitler salutes and violent attacks on immigrant bystanders
the scenes of unrest prompted chancellor angela merkel to denounce mob-like behavior and the persecution of innocent people.
but the events seemed to lay down a new marker in germany 's increasingly fractious domestic politics
the ability of the far right to sustain such mobilization , combined with the relatively weak response of local authorities , alarmed many of the cognoscenti in berlin
said andreas zick , who studies extremist groups at bielefeld university , to my colleagues last week.
theyre feeling better than they have in months.
lgenpresse ( lying press ) was a nazi slogan used to discredit free media
the people chanting it chemnitz know that , of course
this dissonance between centers of power and the hinterlands exists in various western democracies
but they can barely muster a united front at home
germany now finds itself in the worst security dilemma since it rejoined the west in the 1950s by becoming a member of nato and the e.u
its hoped-for strategic partners , russia and china , are increasingly aggressive players in europe , explained constanze stelzenmller of the brookings institution.
within the e.u. , populists and authoritarians are challenging the liberal , postwar consensus
even countries that share that ideal , such as france , spain and the baltic states , disagree about the future of the european project
americas elites stand firm in defense of u.s. security guarantees for europe but their president misses no opportunity to side with autocrats and show contempt for a rules-based order.
last month , german foreign minister heiko maas voiced the growing conviction within the european establishment that it needs to step up and confront trump
he called on european nations to form a counterweight when the u.s. crosses the line and to apply our weight when america retreats.
the afd keeps rising in the wake of chemnitz
but it 's become abundantly clear that europe has no united vision for its role in the world
merkel heads an unhappy centrist coalition being buffeted on both flanks by populist forces
anti-immigrant , far-right factions including a number of euroskeptic , pro-kremlin parties hope to score historic gains in next years european elections ( not to mention this weekend 's vote in sweden )
and france and germany , the two supposed bulwarks of continental unity , are hardly on the same page when it comes to key aspects of security and fiscal policy
what is becoming more pronounced is the challenge posed by the far right
a poll in august found support for merkel 's ruling coalition at a record low and support for the afd at a record high
any vision for europe will first have to look squarely at the gathering storm clouds
