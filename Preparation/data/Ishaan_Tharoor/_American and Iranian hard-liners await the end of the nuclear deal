we are entering the final stretch ahead of president trump 's likely decision to pull out of the nuclear deal between iran and world powers
his administration has to decide by may 12 whether to reimpose economic sanctions on tehran , ones that have been repeatedly waived since the agreement was signed by the obama administration in 2015
many of america 's key allies , especially european leaders , have pleaded with the trump administration to keep the deal intact
over months of negotiations , they have sought to convince their american interlocutors that adhering to the agreement and working to improve it are preferable to scrapping it altogether
in the view of international monitors , foreign governments and even the state department , iran is complying with the terms of the agreement , and there is no better option on the table to curb tehran 's nuclear ambitions
we should not scrap it unless we have a good alternative , said u.n. secretary general antonio guterres to the bbc on thursday , calling the agreement an important diplomatic victory that is necessary amid dangerous times
as iran and israel square off in syria , things could get even more dangerous
the deal 's critics are unmoved , and they are pushing for what they consider a long-overdue confrontation with tehran
the president should stop waiting for congress or the europeans to get serious about renegotiating the jcpoa , wrote bush-era official jamil jaffer , using the formal abbreviation for the iran deal
instead , he should force everyones hand and restore american leverage by reimposing sanctions now
when they dont fear american power , they push forward
with trump , the question is are they going to feel american power , or american mush
but while the deal 's most vocal opponents see it as a feckless pact with the great malign power of the middle east , other analysts point to the complexity of the situation within iran itself
if trump does pull out of the deal , it seems increasingly unlikely that iranian president hassan rouhani who championed diplomacy with the west will be able to resist calls from his country 's hardliners to also renege on their end of the bargain
as iran 's economy tanks , rouhani faces growing criticism from opponents who never supported his efforts at dtente with the west
they include elements of the revolutionary guards , the powerful military organization that largely runs the iranian proxy wars so reviled in washington and is also implicated in the detention of numerous dual nationals on iranian soil
although the rouhani government wishes to sustain the deal and build on it for greater international integration and economic recovery , it is constrained by pressure from its political opponents
iran hawks argue that the idea of rival political camps is an illusion and that rouhani was always beholden to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and the theocratic cabal surrounding him
but the imminent collapse of the pact upon which rouhani staked his credibility , even in the face of heated domestic opposition , may lead the world down a far darker path
vali nasr , dean of the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university , argued that trump should take a totally different path
washington should find ways to reduce tensions by engaging iran directly , picking up where the nuclear deal left off , wrote nasr
it should also encourage iran and saudi arabia to cooperate to resolve regional crises , starting with those in syria and yemen
but that looks unlikely now
we will be left with a world where iran inches towards a nuclear weapon , does not face sufficient pressure , and has no interest in negotiations , wrote goldenberg
that means in a few years , the u.s. will be left with a stark choice military action or living with a nuclear-armed iran
it 's a similar scenario that confronted the obama administration before it embarked on the turgid rounds of talks that led to the current deal
iran watchers can be forgiven for feeling a sense of deja vu
while the reformist president mohammad khatami was in office , george w. bush undermined him and shattered iranians hopes of rapprochement by labeling the country part of the 'axis of evil , wrote saeed kamali dehgan in the guardian
trump could be about to make exactly the same mistake with rouhani
