sen. john mccain , who died at his arizona ranch over the weekend , penned an op-ed in the economist at the end of last year defending the liberal world order
the republican politician was an inveterate internationalist , a staunch advocate of the post-world war ii norms and institutions he believed were essential to american leadership and global prosperity
but with the rise of president trump , the growing strength of right-wing populism in europe and the resilience of illiberal powers elsewhere , mccain feared a great unraveling
john mccain was a true american hero
he devoted his entire life to his country
his voice will be missed
our respectful thoughts go to his beloved ones
our statement on the passing of senator john mccain
as the washington establishment mourned mccains passing , it became clear that it was mourning not just a mans death , but the waning of the world he seemed to represent
the global vision championed by mccain seems to be in profound retreat
trump has systematically chipped away at the transatlantic alliance since coming to power , with officials in europe now calling for a future untethered from an unreliable washington
with social inequality deepening , populations on both sides of the pond are increasingly skeptical of the merits of unfettered free trade and open markets central tenets of mccains worldview
and theres a broader apathy toward the universal values preached by the arizona senator , whose full-throated appeals to democracy and rule of law were shrugged off by trump
readers of todays worldview have likely noticed our frequent invocations of the liberal order or the international order over the past two years
they serve as a shorthand for what trump seems to resent a catchall concept that encompasses everything from multilateral institutions like the european union to principles of free trade to political support for immigrants and refugees
but analysts on both the right and the left argue that this imprecision tends to obscure valid criticism of the wests political status quo
international affairs academic stephen wertheim pointed to this tension in a recent essay
moreover , their rallying around a technocratic international system does little to check the xenophobia of western populists
in mccains case , his embrace of the liberal order ultimately hinged on a belief in american exceptionalism and , by extension , hegemony
his support for bloody , ill-fated wars most notably the 2003 invasion of iraq and his cheerleading for further interventions in the middle east may be remembered long after we forget his advocacy for human rights
and mccains selection of sarah palin as his 2008 running mate prefigured the intolerant , ultranationalist politics that fueled trumps ascent and the assault on the liberal norms mccain claimed to uphold
in his piece , mccain pointed to the power of the marshall plan , hoping to summon the spirit of a decades-old american triumph
but the united states accounted for about half of the worlds gross domestic product at that time now that figure is only about one-seventh
the growth of other countries economies doesnt mean that the united states is losing as trump would contend but it does put mccains triumphalism in context
the world leaders who have loudly defended the liberal order in the face of trumps attacks did so not in honor of a pax americana but because they understand how their nations have benefited from a system underwritten by washington
wrote mira rapp-hooper and rebecca lissner in foreign affairs.
they also recognize that those interests can not be protected without a powerful and committed united states
even china , the orders most formidable challenger-in-waiting , finds value in selectively embracing its tenets
but a new approach , the academics argue , has to reckon with a changing world where americans reconsider the hubris of its post-cold war u.s. grand strategy
wertheim separately points to surveys that suggest younger americans are less committed to principles of american exceptionalism or interested in u.s. global military superiority , both mainstays of mccain-style internationalism
if those attitudes become more prevalent in the years ahead , mccains death may mark an end of an era in ways his friends and allies have yet to admit
