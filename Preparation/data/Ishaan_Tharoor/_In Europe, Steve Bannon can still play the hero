former white house chief strategist stephen k. bannon has been cast out of the west wing , scorned by president trump and cut adrift from the far-right website that helped catapult him into the spotlight
but do n't tell that to his friends in europe
despite his extremely public fall from grace , bannon went on what seemed like a victory march through europe over the past week
he jetted into italy ahead of elections that saw populist parties , including one that shares his brand of nativist populism , claim about half the vote
he then spoke at a nationalist rally in the swiss city of zurich , where he also reportedly met alice weidel , one of the leaders of alternative for germany , a far-right party that now is the largest opposition faction in germany 's parliament
and he journeyed to france for the party congress of the far-right national front , where he delivered a keynote address under the aegis of party leader marine le pen

during both speeches , bannon hailed the electoral gains made by right-wing populist parties across western europe and celebrated the nationalist examples of politicians further to the east
he described hungarian prime minister viktor orban , known for his hostility to both migrants and the european union , as a hero and a patriot.
( unconfirmed reports suggested the two would meet during bannon 's trip )
the warm reception is quite a change from the treatment bannon has been receiving at home
his falling-out with the president also compelled him to leave his beloved website , breitbart news
bannon 's american critics frequently mock his overinflated ego
one white house foe famously described bannon 's behavior in office as nothing but a particularly impossible form of onanism
a number of anti-establishment , right-wing candidates backed by bannon suffered embarrassing defeats in local u.s. elections
but in europe , bannon can justifiably pat himself on the back
more than any of trump 's other confidants , bannon articulated a populist ideology that helped galvanize america 's right-wing voters and brought trump to power
in many ways , his creed directly borrowed from the long-standing positions of europe 's far right , combining a narrative of economic anxiety over globalization with seething cultural resentments about immigration
his rhetoric conspicuously drew from a deep reservoir of european neo-fascism
and having installed that agenda in the west wing , bannon offered further encouragement to his ideological brethren across the pond
bannon told the crowd in the french city of lille , repeating the message he had delivered in affluent zurich a few days earlier.
the tide of history is on our side , he said there , his entrance preceded by a soundtrack that included survivor 's eye of the tiger.
bannon told the new york times on his trip
the thing is that they are generating enthusiasm on shoestrings.
between far-right groups in various countries , he said.
one can feed off the other with messaging.
he said , perhaps remembering how a host of trump supporters embraced their status as deplorables , as hillary clinton called them on the campaign trail
he told the french far right to wear such accusations as a badge of honor.
former white house chief strategist steve bannon speaking to the crowd attending the party congress for france 's far-right national front party let them call you racist
let them call you xenophobes ... wear it as a badge of honor
yet for all the insistence that history is on their side , bannon 's friends in europe still seem to find new ways to turn up at the wrong end of things
not long after bannon 's speech , le pen rebranded her party as the national rally , a name that earned immediate condemnation for its connections to a nazi-aligned world war ii-era faction ( more on that below )
'is obama a racist
one of them asked
another showed portraits of the german wehrmacht fighting in stalingrad during world war ii , and lamented how history has not given them the honor they are due.
