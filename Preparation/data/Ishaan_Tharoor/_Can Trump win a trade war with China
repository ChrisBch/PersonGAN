for years , president trump has railed against the threat of chinese trade
china , he said , was operating on an uneven playing field , using unfair trade practices that supposedly harm the u.s. economy , steal american jobs and contribute to a vast trade deficit that now stands at $ 375 billion
on thursday , he finally took action against beijing
the president announced his decision to impose tariffs on $ 60 billion worth of chinese imports a year and limit china 's capacity to invest in the american technology industry
trump and his lieutenants defend their actions as a way to reassert american sovereignty over matters of international diplomacy and trade
an investigation launched by the administration in august found a range of unfair practices in china , particularly related to beijing 's apparent theft or forced transfer of intellectual property from american businesses
and , like trump 's earlier move to slap tariffs on certain steel and aluminum imports from various countries , including some close allies , the latest measures are another sign that trump is following through on his campaign promises
as a candidate , i pledged that if elected i would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade , protect american workers , and defend our national security
today , we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment
news of the move sent the stock market plunging and boosted fears of a looming trade war
the economist calculated that for every american firm in favor of trump 's protectionist policies , there may be as many as 3,000 opposed
said china 's commerce ministry in a statement issued friday morning in beijing
there were no further details about the products that beijing might target , but there is no lack of options
china , a huge buyer of commercial jets made by the american firm boeing , could look to airbus or other non-u
s. companies in a bid to hurt the american aviation industry
american tech companies like apple and intel , which have significant manufacturing operations in china , could be squeezed with punitive measures
beijing could also mimic the european union 's potential retaliatory measures against the united states , such as tariffs on harley-davidson motorcycles
and it could depreciate its currency , the yuan , to make chinese exports even more competitive and further infuriate trump
noted an editorial in the state-run global times.
they were mostly trump supporters
let them confront trump.
said hun quach , vice president for international trade at the retail industry leaders association , to my colleagues
when a country ( usa ) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with , trade wars are good , and easy to win
example , when we are down $ 100 billion with a certain country and they get cute , dont trade anymore-we win big
trump administration officials speak of reshaping the post-world war ii international system , whose rules are no longer apparently in the american interest
critics decry such thinking , given the extent to which washington wrote those very rules
trump 's critics are hoping he wo n't be also driving the international system wildly off course
