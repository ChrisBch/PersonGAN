according to the last set of opinion polls , a right-wing coalition of parties fronted by berlusconi probably will pick up the biggest block of seats in the italian parliament
berlusconi represents a familiar face at a troubled time in italy
although the country 's economy grew modestly last year , it remains one of the most sluggish in europe
the country 's vast public debt remains an albatross around its neck
close to a third of job-seeking italians between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed
amid the stagnation , an influx of migrants and refugees has led to rising nativism and a rightward lurch in the country 's politics
alongside berlusconi 's forza italia , the far-right northern league , led by the charismatic matteo salvini , has emerged as a prominent faction in the elections and could find its way into power
in recent years , a succession of center-left governments failed to stem the disaffection of voters tired of elites , e.u
demands and centrist attempts at reform
after a high point in european elections in 2014 , support for the ruling democratic party has collapsed nearly by half
the party and its allies are polling behind both berlusconi 's coalition and the anti-establishment five star movement , a euroskeptic party that may claim the most votes in the election but is unlikely to join any other party to form a governing coalition
like their counterparts across western europe , italy 's voters reflect a deepening disenchantment and fragmentation
a significant number as much as a third are undecided on the eve of the election
many may not vote at all
critics , though , point to five star 's checkered record in municipal governance , the incoherence of its stated agenda and the inexperience of its newly minted politicians
any projected winner on sunday may struggle to muster enough seats to form a majority
a grand coalition between center-right and center-left similar to what is taking shape in germany may be the clearest path toward stability , but it will excite no one
and so we return to berlusconi
in 2016 , he was often compared to president trump , another unnaturally hued tycoon-turned-politico who is dogged by allegations of sexual indiscretion , locked in legal battles , loathed by the left and yet simply impossible to put away
( berlusconis lieutenants scoff at parallels to the u.s. president berlusconi does n't love it , close ally giovanni toti told the new york times.
it 's a mistake to compare trump to one of the most experienced statesmen in europe )
berlusconi has embraced the role of the steady hand , deploying the italian phrase for used but in good condition , as journalist rachel donadio wrote in the atlantic
he has campaigned on something of a populist platform , supporting the removal of hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants while promising cash handouts to needy italians
its a profoundly opportunistic pitch , but one unlikely to make any lasting difference
columnist ezio mauro told donadio.
