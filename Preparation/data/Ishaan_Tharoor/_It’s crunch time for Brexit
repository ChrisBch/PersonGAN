looking at things right now , i havent got the foggiest idea what is going to happen in the coming weeks
by wednesday evening , there was only slightly more clarity
british prime minister theresa may announced that her cabinet had , following a long , detailed and impassioned debate , agreed on a draft withdrawal plan with the european union
the outlines of the divorce were finalized with e.u
counterparts earlier this week following months of fitful negotiations
may framed the days developments as a decisive step toward an orderly separation from the european union , hoping to assuage fears that britain could exit the continental bloc without any deal in place
the draft agreement , which is hundreds of pages long , leaves open the possibility that britain could remain indefinitely in a customs union with the european union
it also has provisions preventing a hard border between ireland and northern ireland , one of the biggest sticking points in the talks
in a news conference in brussels , michel barnier , the e.u
's chief negotiator on brexit , welcomed signs of progress in london.
the united kingdom will remain our friend , our partner , our ally , barnier added
even so , brexit is hardly a fait accompli
whatever happens , this deal is just the first stage of the lengthy process of ratifying britains withdrawal from the e.u
to follow are negotiations over britains future trade , security and economic relations with europe including side deals about immigration levels , noted my colleagues
the deal with the european union requires endorsement from european heads of state
far more difficult will be a vote in britains parliament , where mays plan may yet falter
at least a third of mays own cabinet members balked over the draft agreement , and the right-wing northern irish party that joined mays conservatives in a ruling coalition will likely resist measures that legally separate northern ireland from the rest of the country
theresa mays brexit agreement is the worst deal in history
in histrionic language , proponents of a hard brexit decried mays accommodation with the e.u
as a betrayal that left britain in thrall to colonial rule from brussels
there was rampant speculation on wednesday that disgruntled hard-liners may force a vote of confidence on mays leadership within days
brexit was a defining moment for western politics
it prefigured the rise of anti-immigrant parties elsewhere in europe
president trump , then considered a long shot against hillary clinton , seized upon its victory as a good omen for his own insurgency against a liberal establishment
british politicians like johnson and trump ally nigel farage offered visions of returning the country to its glory days , taking back control of its laws and its future from bureaucrats across the channel
but it was never as simple as that
may , who tepidly opposed brexit before the referendum , has found it nearly impossible to navigate around both the demands of brexit cheerleaders and the vastly superior negotiating position of the e.u
and the chaotic attempts to forge an agreement have led to growing calls for a new referendum on whether brexit should happen at all
new polls suggest a majority of britons would favor holding another referendum on the final brexit deal
last month , some 700,000 pro-e.u
protesters marched through london demanding a second vote
a choice between a dodgy deal & no deal is no choice at all
the british public deserve a real choice between leaving the eu on these terms or sticking with the deal weve got inside the eu
were not buying this dodgy deal
only the people can sort this out peoplesvote
but that would require quite a few parliamentary twists and turns
for now , attention is focused on the scale of the potential rebellion against may
not only is a significant portion of her own party angry , but labour leader jeremy corbyn has decried the shambolic handling of the brexit negotiations and is also likely to reject her plan if it reaches a vote
observed an editorial in the guardian
and beyond that , theres the already mounting economic and social impact of this sundering of the union
