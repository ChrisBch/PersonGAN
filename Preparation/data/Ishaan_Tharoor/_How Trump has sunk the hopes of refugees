historically , the united states has been the most welcoming nation on the planet for refugees
since the adoption of the 1980 u.s
refugee act , it has taken in around 3 million of the more than 4 million refugees who have been resettled around the world
but president trump has made the denigration of refugees a core theme of his presidency , and his administration has all but barred the gates to foreigners seeking refuge in america
according to studies released earlier this summer , 2017 marked the first year in almost four decades when the united states took in fewer refugees than the rest of the world
while washington still accepted more refugees than any single nation , that number dropped to 33,000 from about 97,000 the year before
when counted as a percentage of the nations overall population , american admission lagged far behind countries like canada , australia and norway
the report detailed
68,500,000 people.68,500,000 stories.68,500,000 dreams.68,500,000 journeys.68,500,000 lives uprooted.68,500,000 missed chances.68,500,000 longing for home.68,500,000 unthinkable tragedies.68,500,000 heads full of memories.68,500,000 were displaced at the end of 2017
such actions are often justified on security or economic grounds , with trump arguing that immigration imports terrorism and kills american jobs
using those arguments , he and his lieutenants have tried to crack down legal and illegal migration alike
report was later savaged in a court filing by a group of former counterterrorism officials
said joshua geltzer , a former national security council senior director for counterterrorism , to my colleague ellen nakashima.
thats a radicalization problem
not an immigration problem.
of course , none of this is likely to matter to trump or his allies
their opposition to immigration is about ideology and identity rather than policy something thats neatly illustrated by the data on refugees resettled in the united states under trump
europe and the u.s. must immediately stop taking in people from syria
this will be the destruction of civilization as we know it
its not hard to infer whats at work here
trump is , after all , the man who declared he wanted more immigrants from norway rather than sh -- hole countries outside of europe
his cheerleaders in right-wing media have already started to shift the goal posts well beyond matters of refugees or migrants , challenging , instead , the core premise that diversity is americas strength
now , with trump turning his back , many in the international community worry that other governments could follow suit , leaving poorer countries in the developing world to bear the brunt of refugee crises in the middle east , asia and africa.
if that sharing diminishes , u.n. refugee agency chief filippo grandi told reporters last year , my humanitarian negotiating power diminishes as well.
that ebbing of influence may prove to be one of the more stark legacies of the trump presidency
