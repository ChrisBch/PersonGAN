this weekend in gaza , palestinians buried their dead after israeli soldiers killed at least 18 palestinian protesters and wounded hundreds more on friday
about 30,000 palestinians had gathered near the fenced barrier separating the gaza strip from israel , both protesting the stifling blockade on their territory and mourning the dispossession of their ancestral lands at the hands of the israeli state
as in many other palestinian protests that take place in the occupied territories , most protesters were unarmed and nonviolent
families picnicked in the shadow of the israeli border and flew palestinian flags
but like so many other palestinian protests , this one ended in tears
israeli authorities claimed they opened fire in response to some protesters who had encroached near the fence , burning tires and hurling stones or molotov cocktails
footage that emerged from the chaotic scene suggested israeli soldiers targeted unarmed protesters , including some who were running away and were shot from a distance by snipers
his brother mohammed told the post
the killings marked the worst day of violence in gaza since the 2014 war between the islamist group hamas and the israeli military , in which the united nations said at least 1,462 palestinian civilians died
and the aftermath of the protests underscored both the desperate futility of the palestinian struggle and the relative impunity with which israel can snuff out palestinian lives
officials described the protest as a camouflage for hamas infiltrators supposedly launching an attack across the fortified border
defense minister avigdor liberman rebuffed international calls for an investigation , saying that under no circumstances would there be an inquiry into the incident and opining that the israeli soldiers manning the fence deserve a commendation.
on saturday , the idf even boasted that its troops had maintained total control of the situation down to the number of bullets fired
but the israeli military soon deleted the tweet as more footage surfaced of panicked palestinians being gunned down while trying to flee
the israeli military tweeted they knew where every bullet landed , then deleted it , probably because there is video showing their bullets landing in the backs of unarmed protesters
the israeli leadership had reason to feel comfortable in its defiance
the most vocal criticism from abroad came from iran and turkey censure from either country is more likely a source of relish for netanyahu than unease
and at the united nations , the trump administration blocked the security council from issuing a statement that called for an independent and transparent investigation and affirmed the palestinians right to peaceful protest
state department spokeswoman heather nauert said the united states was deeply saddened by fridays events
but jason greenblatt , trumps leading envoy for israeli and palestinian negotiations , undercut that message by taking israels side and pinning the blame on hamas for the hostile march.

it also happens that the white house has chosen that date to open its new embassy in jerusalem , a move that reinforced the palestinian view that washington can no longer be trusted as a fair broker in the long-stalled peace process
the killing of palestinian demonstrators by israeli forces in gaza is tragic
it is the right of all people to protest for a better future without a violent response
meanwhile , the situation in gaza remains a humanitarian disaster
the u.s. must play a more positive role in ending the gaza blockade and helping palestinians and israelis build a future that works for all
nor can the palestinians look for much help from their neighbors
as weve discussed in this space , some of the regions key powers most notably egypt and saudi arabia have moved closer to israel in recent years
the violence friday should also be seen as another episode in the long-running power struggle between hamas and the palestinian authority , led by mahmoud abbas
attempts at reconciliation between the two factions have faltered , and the two sides themselves have grown weaker
abbas , the lost shepherd of an all-but-dead peace process , has little chance of making progress and perhaps even less credibility , while hamas has been squeezed by both israel and egypt and has seen its sources of outside funding dry up
all the while , the ongoing blockade and restrictions imposed on gaza have made conditions more difficult for the palestinians who live there.
i want to be shot , one 22-year-old protester told my colleagues on friday.
i dont want this life.

a typo in an earlier version of this article incorrectly dated the anniversary of the nakba as an event in march
it is in may
