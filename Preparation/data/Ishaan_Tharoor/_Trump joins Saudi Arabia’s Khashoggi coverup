its now been two weeks since saudi journalist jamal khashoggi disappeared after entering his countrys consulate in istanbul
reports from turkish sources that the saudis allegedly murdered and dismembered the dissident writer , a washington post contributor , have fanned a growing backlash against riyadh in western capitals
but the kingdom has circled the wagons and angrily hit back at the accusations and it seems to have found a willing ally in president trump
just spoke to the king of saudi arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened to our saudi arabian citizen.
he said that they are working closely with turkey to find answer
i am immediately sending our secretary of state to meet with king
the posts shane harris reported last week that u.s. intelligence intercepts suggested crown prince mohammed bin salman had approved a scheme to lure khashoggi out of de facto exile in the united states and detain him
khashoggi , 59 , a former riyadh insider with a colorful career in politics and journalism , had moved overseas to express his disquiet with the kingdoms leadership , particularly the youthful mohammed
if the saudis do confirm that khashoggi died on their watch , it will be a damning admission after days of obfuscation and denials
over the weekend , the saudi government railed against foreign conspirators supposedly bent on undermining the kingdoms reputation
its foreign ministry issued a defiant statement warning of the demise of any pressure campaign against riyadh
it cajoled a number of arab nations in the saudi orbit , including bahrain , the united arab emirates and egypt , to issue statements affirming their solidarity with the saudis
the saudi government also put out a notice threatening any rumormongers within the country with five-year jail sentences
to soften the blow of an about-face , the saudis will offer a version of events that attempts to insulate the crown prince from blame for the debacle , according to reports monday
but many current and former u.s. officials in washington still have a hard time believing that what transpired within a saudi consulate wouldnt have had the blessing of senior royals in riyadh
this never would have happened without mbss approval
never , never , never , a former senior u.s. diplomat with long experience in saudi arabia told my colleagues , referring to mohammed
trump now finds himself in a delicate situation one entirely of his own making
as weve covered extensively in todays worldview , the white house saw in riyadh a committed ally against iran and a willing customer for u.s. arms companies
trump has said outright that he is hesitant to crack the whip on riyadh lest he compromise billions of dollars in weapons sales to the saudis
leon panetta , a defense secretary and cia director under president barack obama , told my colleagues
it seems increasingly clear that it was not a winning bet
mohammed carried out a sustained charm offensive in the west , wooing u.s. politicians , media and business executives with grand visions of his countrys liberalization and reform
critics scoffed at such optimism , pointing to the crown princes record of detaining political opponents , muffling civil society and presiding over a ruinous , bloody war in yemen that may trigger the worst famine in a century
the imbroglio over khashoggi could be the proverbial straw that breaks the saudi pr camels back
the question for trump , should the grim reports around khashoggis death prove true , is how much longer can his indulgence of the saudis last
