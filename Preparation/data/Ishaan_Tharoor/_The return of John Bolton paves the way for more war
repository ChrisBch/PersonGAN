it 's no small irony that the same week in which ultra-hawk john bolton finally rose to a position of power at the white house also marked the 15th anniversary of the disastrous war he helped birth
bolton , a veteran swamp creature who held several national security posts in both bush administrations , is poised to replace h.r
mcmaster as national security adviser in early april
mcmasters departure and boltons appointment were both expected after weeks of white house whispers , but their tweeted confirmation on thursday still set alarm bells ringing across the capital
i am pleased to announce that , effective 4/9/18 , ambjohnbolton will be my new national security advisor
i am very thankful for the service of general h.r
mcmaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend
there will be an official contact handover on 4/9
there are few more notorious hard-liners in washington than bolton , a 69-year-old former diplomat known for being profoundly undiplomatic
he shares president trumps scorn for multilateralism , and his loathing for the united nations ( where bolton served a brief stint as u.s. ambassador ) is matched by his contempt for the european union
he sees both institutions as forums for ponderous deliberations that undermine american sovereignty and impede washington 's ability to act decisively
boltons geopolitical impatience matches his rumored professional demeanor allegations of bullying and abuse trail his conduct in office
in 2005 congressional testimony , he was famously described as a kick-down , kiss-up manager by a state department colleague
that insight derailed his chances of permanently securing the u.n. post ( he was later chosen by recess appointment )
but under trump , boltons bellicosity has catapulted him into the most important foreign policy position in the white house
bolton played a key role in laying the groundwork for the 2003 invasion of iraq
as the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs from 2001 to 2005 , he helped push the fiction that saddam hussein was actively developing weapons of mass destruction
british officials noted in a now-infamous secret memo to the prime ministers office in 2002 that the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy of the bush administration
during that time , bolton allegedly moved to punish subordinates who sought to check his manipulation of intelligence
of course , there were no wmds to be found
but bolton and his neoconservative allies got the war they wanted , a seismic event in modern history that prefigured so much of the instability that wracks the middle east
conservative washington post columnist george will wrote , excoriating boltons appointment
my official statement on accepting potus request to become the next national security advisor
bolton , one of the perpetrators , seems to have profited from that amnesia
he doggedly defends the decision to go to war to this day and hes not alone
other pundits and chickenhawks who cheered the 2003 invasion remain ensconced in their perches in washington
trump , who lambasted the iraq war on the campaign trail , has elevated one of its few remaining champions
a host of critics are fretting over the growing possibility of armed conflict with north korea and iran and with good reason
last month , bolton wrote an op-ed in the wall street journal touting the viability of a preventive strike on north korea
he also seems unconvinced about trumps plans to hold talks with kim jong un
he told radio free asia just last week that washington should not offer economic concessions and reiterated his interest in regime change , suggesting that trumps time at the negotiating table may be brief
bolton has undercut diplomacy with north korea in the past , as well
in 2001 , he helped convince president george w. bush to step away from a faltering nonproliferation agreement with pyongyang rather than reinforce it with new rounds of diplomacy
north korea made significant advances in its nuclear program during the period of isolation that followed , as did its fellow axis of evil member iran
here is john bolton , in his memoir , admitting that he supported talks with north korea in 2002 only because he expected them to fail , which he could then use to discredit diplomacy and pursue more hawkish policies on north korea
thats all the more true with iran
boltons ascension , combined with former cia director mike pompeo 's nomination as secretary of state , makes it almost certain that the trump administration will withdraw from the nuclear deal in may
bolton has advocated regime change in iran for years , has received money from a shadowy iranian opposition group deemed a cult by the state department and has called for the country to be bombed
it seems that bolton will conduct a thorough purge of the national security staff in the white house , a move that could deepen the aggressive militarism that has become the signature theme of trumps worldview
