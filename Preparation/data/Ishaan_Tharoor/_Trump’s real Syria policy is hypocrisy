after a week of signaling an imminent exit from the syrian conflict , president trump mixed his messages once more with a furious set of tweets sunday
responding to reports of another potential chemical weapons strike carried out by the syrian regime , trump decried the mindless chemical attack in syria and pinned the blame on president bashar al-assad and his russian and iranian patrons
big price to pay , trump warned
but it was unclear what that price is and who might pay it other than syria 's brutalized civilian population , that is
according to my colleagues , at least 40 people , including children , were killed saturday evening in east ghouta , a rebel-held enclave enduring a protracted government siege
first responders noted a chlorine-like odor after the attack , and patients showed symptoms such as respiratory ailments and foaming at the mouth
many dead , including women and children , in mindless chemical attack in syria
area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by syrian army , making it completely inaccessible to outside world
president putin , russia and iran are responsible for backing animal assad
... .to pay
open area immediately for medical help and verification
another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever
monday happens to mark the first day on the job for trump 's new national security adviser , john bolton , an outspoken proponent of unilateral american action around the world
bolton was scheduled to chair a meeting on syria , and bossert suggested that all options were on the table.
by monday morning , both syrian and russian authorities said israeli warplanes had carried out the strike as part of the israelis ongoing covert campaign against pro-iranian influence in the country
israeli officials did not initially comment on the reports
it remains to be seen whether trump will repeat what he did last year after an alleged syrian regime chemical-weapons strike in idlib province
he ordered u.s. navy ships to pound a syrian government airfield with 59 tomahawk missiles , then memorably shared the news over dessert with chinese president xi jinping , who was visiting trump at his florida resort
but if that punishment was meant to send a message to assad , its effect has long since worn off and washington hawks are clamoring for more
they urged trump over the weekend to reconsider his desire to withdraw american ground forces from syria , a move they argue surrenders american leverage as the assad regime looks to consolidate its position
the latest regime attack , frederic hof of the atlantic council said in an emailed statement , was a challenge to trump 's credibility.
graham urged trump to follow through on his bellicose tweets
trump , though , has shown little interest in owning the end game in syria
he balks at the cost of the american war effort in the middle east and central asia and cares chiefly about fighting the islamic state
he also shares his predecessor 's wariness of getting too entangled in a push toward regime change
soon after trump 's sunday-morning twitter salvo , many commentators pointed to his criticism from four years ago , when the obama administration contemplated how to punish assad for a chemical-weapons attack
the use of the illicit weapons crossed obama 's declared red line , but trump was doggedly opposed to any u.s. airstrikes on the regime
he also expressed concern for civilians they could put at risk
president obama , do not attack syria
there is no upside and tremendous downside
save your powder for another ( and more important ) day
if obama attacks syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed , he and the u.s. will look very bad
of course , trump is entitled to change his opinion over time
but on sunday , he again tried to focus the blame on his predecessor , whom he now accused of not being tough enough on the assad regime in other words , for following trump 's own advice at the time
if president obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand , the syrian disaster would have ended long ago
animal assad would have been history
tweeted post columnist josh rogin.
the height of hypocrisy.
there 's another important dimension to trump 's hypocrisy
trump may fret over the horrors unleashed by assad , but he has been unable to muster much compassion for thousands of syrian refugees his administration moved to block from entering the united states
while he feared for innocent civilians getting hurt and killed four years ago , he has presided over an escalating air war around the world
the resulting civilian death toll is unconfirmed , but it likely runs in the hundreds , if not thousands
trump is not so bothered by this sort of suffering anymore
my colleague greg jaffe reported over the weekend on a cia briefing trump attended on his first full day in office , during which the new president watched footage of a drone strike on a suspected islamist militant target
u.s. authorities had chosen to wait for the fighter to walk away from a building that housed his family trump was confused that the cia chose to spare the lives of the islamist militant 's family
this apparent cruelty now seems coupled with indifference
targeted airstrikes may briefly chasten the assad regime , but they cant change the broader facts on the ground
russia , iran and turkey have seized the initiative and are haggling over syrias political future while trump seeks to pummel the islamist militants and then disengage as quickly as possible
experts on counterterrorism stress that building economic growth and political inclusion in these war-torn societies is the real solution toward preventing future destabilizing and miserable insurgencies
trumps disinterest , they say , may have real costs
