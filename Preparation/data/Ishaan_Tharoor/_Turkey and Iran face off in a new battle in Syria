syria 's messy war is becoming even messier
on tuesday , pro-regime militias reportedly moved into the embattled enclave of afrin , which is under siege from turkish forces who invaded syria last month
the regime units appeared to be reinforcing syrian kurdish factions that have controlled the area near the turkish border , much to the frustration of ankara
as i wrote during the early days of the turkish incursion , the battles in afrin risk a wider conflagration
the main syrian kurdish armed group , known as the ypg , is seen by turkey as a direct proxy of the outlawed kurdistan worker 's party , or pkk , which operates inside turkey and is considered a terrorist organization by ankara and washington
but the united states supports the ypg , depending on its fighters to help combat the jihadist islamic state
washington 's complicated role in the war as well as its decision to avoid becoming deeply involved in the clashes in afrin compelled the syrian kurdish militias to turn to president bashar al-assad for help
ypg spokesman nouri mahmoud told reporters tuesday
meanwhile , turkish president recep tayyip erdogan said turkey would begin a heavy assault on the city center of afrin in coming days
he described the syrian government 's move as the work of terrorists and claimed turkish artillery had driven the pro-assad forces back
syrian sources claim that the barrage only briefly stalled the advance of the pro-assad forces

it is the sort of bewildering entanglement that characterizes the ruinous seven-year conflict , its constellation of warring parties and their tangled sets of interests

turkish media incorrectly claims syrian fighters left afrin
from the iranian perspective , the turkish operation in afrin was unwelcome
iranian leaders , including president hassan rouhani , denounced the invasion , which soured recent talks held between russia , turkey and iran over syria 's political future
according to the middle east affairs website al-monitor , iranian officials have pressed their turkish counterparts to avoid a messy war of attrition in syria
outside afrin , the syrian chessboard is no less crowded
rebel islamist groups in nearby idlib province are battling each other while also partnering with turkish forces against the syrian regime and its allies
the american air war in syria , primarily directed at the islamic state , has also led to the deaths of russian mercenaries
the assad government , with russian support , continues to mercilessly pound rebel-held areas
and israel , alarmed at iran 's entrenched presence in syria , recently carried out airstrikes on suspected iranian positions
israeli officials openly talk about the prospect of entering a more intense regional war
wrote nicholas danforth , a turkey expert at the bipartisan policy center in washington
but that means reckoning with a regime that is still guilty of slaughtering scores of its own people
on tuesday , as the battle for afrin intensified , the regime pummeled the rebel-held damascus suburb of east ghouta , killing more than 100 people in what aid agencies described as one of the bloodiest 24 hours of the syrian war
unicef issued a communique with a large blank space , stating that no words will do justice to the children killed.
it was yet another cry of exasperation and despair in a conflict that is still finding new depths of cruelty to plumb
