jair bolsonaro is the clear favorite to become brazils next president
polls place the far-right candidate comfortably in front of his challenger , fernando haddad , ahead of their oct. 28 runoff vote
that agenda has rung alarms inside and outside brazil
in last-ditch television ads , haddad linked his heavily favored opponent to the grim history of abuse and torture under the countrys former military rulers
the economist , a publication known for its center-right politics , was so perturbed by the real threat bolsonaro poses to brazilian democracy that it endorsed a latin american leftist
but while experts and pundits wring their hands over another blow to liberal democracy in the west , others see a more dire risk lurking behind bolsonaros platform the candidates potential war on the environment
ditadura nunca mais
tortura nunca mais
in speeches , bolsonaro has declared that , like president trump , he would pull his country out of the paris climate accords
courting the support of the powerful agribusiness lobby , bolsonaro has railed against the countrys excessive policing of its rural areas and forests
he floated the idea of combining the countrys agriculture and environment ministries , which critics worry would enfeeble environmental protections
and he has long supported opening up indigenous areas , currently protected by the government , to agricultural and commercial use
noted the financial times
until now , brazil has been a leader in the battle against climate change
it hosted the pioneering earth summit in 1992 , when world leaders first convened to sign a u.n.-backed convention on climate change
starting in the mid-2000s , its left-wing government worked doggedly to curb deforestation in the amazon basin , the proverbial lungs of the world
brazil pledged zero illegal deforestation by the end of the next decade as well as significant reductions of its carbon emissions
its ratification of the paris accord in september 2016 was viewed at the time as a huge victory for international climate campaigners
and it is expected to host the next round of u.n.-brokered negotiations on climate policy in november 2019
but data shows that deforestation has picked up in recent years
global demand for brazilian beef and soy , two of the countrys chief commodities for export , has led to further expansion of farmland in forested areas
with bolsonaro at the helm , the assumption is that things will only get worse
the amazon of brazil has the world 's largest rainforest and species richness and diversity
today , the amazon faces multiple threats due to unsustainable economic development like deforestation where 20 % of its biome has been lost over the last 50 years
outside the countrys borders , a bolsonaro presidency may dent the already-fragile international efforts to tackle carbon emissions
in addition to trumps noisy defection from the paris agreement last year , rancor over proposed targets for emissions cuts led to australias prime minister being ousted by his own party two months ago
observed joshua busby for the posts monkey cage blog
bolsonaro does not embrace climate denial as ardently as trump
instead , he has argued that the challenge should be seen as a demographic and family-planning problem
but he also echoed the american presidents insistence that international agreements regarding climate change infringe on national sovereignty and therefore should be rejected
said carlos rittl , the executive secretary of the climate observatory , a brazilian organization , to todays worldview
the prognosis , after all , is bleak a u.n. panel on climate change warned this month that the world stands on the brink of failure if rapid and far-reaching measures are not made to curb emissions of greenhouse gases
that includes converting large swaths of agricultural land to growing trees
bolsonaro is moving in exactly the opposite direction
and under his leadership , rittl warned , brazil may soon become part of the climate-change problem
