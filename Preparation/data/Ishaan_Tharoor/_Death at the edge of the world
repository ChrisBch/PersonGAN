on north sentinel island , a spit of coral and rock in indias far-flung andaman and nicobar islands , lives one of the planets most isolated groups of people
they are a tribe of hunter-gatherers known as the sentinelese , a name given to them because no one has any clue what they call themselves
nor does anyone know how many of them there are the best guesses put their population at fewer than 100
this tiny community is now at the center of global attention thanks to a 26-year-old american missionary named john allen chau
chau traveled to the island this month , hoping to convert the sentinelese to christianity
they killed him instead
chaus story illustrated how hard it is to keep modern society from penetrating any corner of the earth even the ones that want nothing to do with it
the sentinelese believed to be direct descendants of a migration from africa some 50,000 years ago have historically been hostile to visitors , and for good reason
encounters with outsiders , especially under the aegis of 19th-century british colonial authorities , decimated the aboriginal populations of the andaman and nicobar islands
like so many other indigenous peoples during the age of european empires , the tribes of the islands were unprepared for foreign diseases and vulnerable to the explorers who saw them as specimens of primeval man subjects for zoological study , not human compassion
there 's been a lot of talk about the missionary killed by the natives of north sentinel island
they 're probably so aggressive because of this weirdo , maurice vidal portman
so here 's a big thread about this creep and some facts from my decade-long obsession with the island
in the 1970s , a national geographic film director who approached north sentinel island with a team was hit in the leg by an arrow
in 2006 , two marooned indian fishermen were killed there , their bodies reportedly propped up on the beach in a lurid display
sporadic gift-giving missions carried out by anthropologists stopped taking place by the 1990s , with academics and authorities convinced the sentinelese were better off left alone
the tribe , along with a handful of other aboriginal communities in the archipelago , lives beyond the pale of the indian state , which has outlawed visits to the island to preserve its inhabitants isolation
but none of this was about to deter chau
he paid local fishermen to help him evade indian navy patrols , then , once close enough , paddled to the island in a kayak and attempted to make contact
according to a diary he kept , chau sang devotional songs and proffered gifts of scissors , fish and a soccer ball to the people he saw
in response , at least one person shot an arrow that punctured the americans waterproof copy of the bible
he wrote in the diary , which was provided to the washington post by his mother
the morning after chaus last trip to the island , the fishermen who conveyed him to north sentinel saw his body being dragged around a beach and buried in the sand
indian authorities arrested five of the fishermen for helping chau make the illegal and fatal journey , and they now are puzzling over what to do about retrieving his remains
attempting contact is a fraught endeavor that could lead to further violence and expose the sentinelese to outside contagion
a police team that approached the island on friday reportedly saw a number of the sentinelese standing watch , bows at the ready
among the sentinelese , pathak told the post
in eras past , stories of martyrdom helped spread christianity through certain parts of asia
but chaus demise has mostly inspired outrage , with critics in india and elsewhere riled by the selfish foolhardiness of his mission
chau said that he tried to communicate with the sentinelese in xhosa
there is certainly far more sympathy for the plight of populations like the sentinelese than there was in the past , but indigenous communities like theirs are hardly any safer than before
in many places , the perils posed by climate change and the resource demands of developing countries have only deepened the vulnerability of isolated tribes
he once declared
brazils amazon region is home to roughly 100 uncontacted tribes more than any other country on earth and activists are now warning of a new genocide should bolsonaro follow through on his promises
in many cases , though , indigenous communities are undermined not by faraway political fiat , but by the pressure of a world inexorably closing around them
pandit , an indian anthropologist who spent decades studying the aboriginal peoples of the andamans , lamented the effects outside exposure has had on them
in an interview with the new york times last year , he pointed to the steady depletion of the jarawa tribe , neighbors to the sentinelese , after extended contact with outsiders
their numbers have thinned fewer people among the younger generation know the skills or languages of their ancestors
