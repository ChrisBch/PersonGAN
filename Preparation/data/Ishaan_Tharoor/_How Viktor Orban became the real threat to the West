hungary 's prime minister viktor orban seeks to win reelection for a third consecutive term this sunday
his ruling fidesz party is widely expected to secure enough seats to give orban a fresh mandate , although a fragmented vote could deprive him of a decisive majority
in power since 2010 , orban is europe 's second-longest-ruling leader after germany 's angela merkel and he 's become just as influential
a liberal who drifted right in the decades after the fall of the soviet union , orban , 54 , now styles himself an illiberal democrat , a majoritarian populist who stands up for his nation 's interests , traditions and culture
austria 's new prime minister , sebastian kurz , who came to power in alliance with the far right , praised orban 's tough stance on immigration
president trump seemed to take a page from orban 's book when he delivered a thundering blood-and-soil speech last year in poland
on a trip to europe this year , stephen k. bannon , far-right ideologue and former trump adviser , hailed orban as a real hero and the most significant guy in the european scene.
orban 's critics see him as a soft autocrat
hungary under his rule is far from a jackbooted dictatorship , but its democracy is diverging markedly from that of many of its partners in the european union
opponents point to a new class of crony capitalists establishing fiefdoms with the prime minister 's blessing
orban 's government exercises subtle yet domineering control over the judiciary and the media
it has reworked the country 's electoral system to its benefit partly through gerrymandering and giving citizenship to ethnic hungarians abroad , the vast majority of whom opt for fidesz
and it is squeezing the space for civil society , stepping up efforts to target ngos and other institutions whose politics or work do not align with the ruling party 's interest
but at least for now , it seems to be a winning strategy
orban beats the drum of a far-right populist , albeit one who has a seat at the table in brussels and powerful allies across europe
his signature tactic is a weaponized culture war , anchored in an emotional narrative of hungarian victimhood and redemption
he wants to make the nation great again after centuries of subjugation and humiliation at the hands of the ottomans , the victors of world war i , the soviet union and now menacing globalists to the west
orban said at rally to more than 100,000 people in central budapest last month.
now we will send home uncle george.
meanwhile , fidesz 's place inside the european people 's party , a powerful center-right alliance in the european parliament , gives it a degree of political cover
orban can call on the support of prominent western european politicians , including leading figures in merkel 's bavarian sister party , who share orban 's antipathy toward migrants
this institutional backing , critics say , has prevented the european union from taking a tougher line with hungary
muller , in a separate op-ed for the new york times , feared that sunday 's ballot marked a moment of reckoning for europe
