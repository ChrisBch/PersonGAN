on friday , the turkish lira suffered its biggest one-day devaluation in nearly two decades , dropping more than 14 percent against the dollar
the minister of finance the son-in-law of turkish president recep tayyip erdogan couldnt avert the slide , delivering a halting speech that did little to boost confidence
but erdogan , as he so often does , placed the blame on a foreign scapegoat the united states
shame on you , shame on you , he declared at a rally
you are swapping your strategic partner in nato for a pastor.
the pastor in question is andrew brunson , an american clergyman who has been in turkish custody since 2016
he is charged with espionage and other crimes charges that he and u.s. officials reject
attempts to win his freedom have so far failed
according to my colleagues , ankara hoped to swap brunson for hakan atilla , a banker convicted in the united states for his role in a scheme that skirted u.s. sanctions on iranian oil
but the trump administration resents turkeys use of brunson as a political hostage
a high-level meeting in washington last week with a visiting turkish delegation ended abruptly after the americans demanded the pastors immediate release
president trump then announced increased tariffs on turkish aluminum and steel , which sent the value of the lira plummeting to a historic low
turkeys economic woes are of its own making , but the tariffs made things worse and trump was only too happy to take credit
i have just authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to turkey as their currency , the turkish lira , slides rapidly downward against our very strong dollar
aluminum will now be 20 % and steel 50 %
our relations with turkey are not good at this time
if the united states wont change its approach , erdogan warned , turkey will start looking for new friends and allies.
indeed , the turkish president has beefed up ties with russia , attempted to mend fences with key western european governments and , as a significant importer of iranian oil , could undermine american efforts to isolate tehran
but this posturing will win him even more enemies in washington , where erdogan is already a deeply unpopular figure
congress has passed legislation making a critical sale of f-35 jets to turkey contingent upon terms that include brunsons immediate release
erdogan critics in u.s. foreign policy circles loathe his creeping authoritarianism
and trump , unlike previous presidents , has shown an endless willingness to bully erstwhile allies whenever he disagrees with them
noted the wall street journal.
trump instead squeezed ankara further.
this had global ramifications turkeys wobbles stoked wider fears of fragility in other emerging markets and raised alarms among some major european banks that hold turkish debt
but productive diplomacy is in short supply
much of erdogans politics now hinge on stirring nationalist sentiment to justify his tightening grip on the country
he won re-election in june with the backing of ultra-nationalists , arguing that greater control would help him steer turkeys flagging economy out of trouble
instead , things have only gotten worse
erdogan today they are shaving our beard , but tomorrow it will grow back thicker
wrote aykan erdemir , a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies in washington and an erdogan critic
trump also may gain more by refusing to compromise
he may relish the chance to act tough and appeal to his core supporters by squeezing a prominent muslim leader over the fate of an american pastor
wrote elmira bayrasli , a professor of international affairs at bard college
