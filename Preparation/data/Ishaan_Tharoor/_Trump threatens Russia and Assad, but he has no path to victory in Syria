for trump , who loves winning , there 's no winning in syria
but he still has the capacity to make things worse
trump can tweet furiously about what an animal syrian president bashar al-assad is
he can point fingers , albeit hypocritically , at his predecessor for not doing enough to confront assad 's regime
he can declare mission accomplished in the fight against the islamic state
and he can threaten russia , a committed assad ally , with an incoming fusillade of missiles , as he did on wednesday morning
russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria
get ready russia , because they will be coming , nice and new and smart
you shouldnt be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it
but trump has neither a plan nor the appetite to stop assad 's brutal consolidation of power and the regime 's steady destruction of the remaining pockets of rebellion
to be fair , the complexity of what has unfolded in syria has tied far more experienced foreign-policy practitioners in knots
many members of the washington establishment spent years clamoring for a sharper strategy to both rein in assad and help end syria 's ruinous conflict
they criticized the obama administration for not carrying out airstrikes against the regime , sufficiently bolstering moderate rebels or adhering to its own red lines on the use of illicit weapons
but , given the deep involvement of russia and iran on assad 's side , it was never certain that a limited u.s. military intervention would be enough to dislodge assad from damascus
the alternative a full-blown war effort against assad was understandably unpalatable
and the united states is not exactly a bystander in syria it trained syrian rebels and provided them with key weaponry in the fight against the regime
and , through its campaign against the islamic state , it has bombed the country some 13,000 times within the past four years and currently has around 2,000 troops on the ground
trump , meanwhile , spoke actively against fomenting regime change on the campaign trail
his administration froze state department funds intended to help stabilize parts of syria recovered from the islamic state
over the past week , the white house signaled it wanted to withdraw its forces from syria now that the islamic state appears to have been routed
critics argued that trump was effectively sending a message to assad and patrons to not worry about the united states shifting the tide of battle against the regime
then came saturday and the apparent chemical weapons attack on a suburb of damascus
trump promised a quick response to the atrocious attack.
it cant be allowed to happen , he told reporters
and after the u.n. security council failed to take meaningful action on tuesday , the odds grew of an imminent u.s. ( and possibly french ) strike on the assad regime
if history is any precedent , though , assad was probably not that concerned
exactly a year ago , trump ordered a strike on a syrian airfield after another regime chemical attack
the raid did nothing to alter the trajectory of the war , and there 's no reason another strike would be any more effective.
a few cruise missiles wont change anything , the washington post 's editorial board declared this week
emile hokayem of the international institute for strategic studies , a once-vocal advocate of countering assad and arming mainstream syrian rebels , told my colleagues this week that the time for intervention had passed.
that 's a reflection of both a battlefield tilted solidly in assad 's favor and the trump administration 's confused messaging
the risk of such an escalation is real
a syrian air base that housed iranian personnel was struck on monday apparently by israel highlighting how quickly retaliatory measures could morph into a shooting war with iran
( of course , that war would have many cheerleaders in washington , especially if carried out largely in secret by the israelis )
any american attack on syrian military assets also presents the possibility of conflict with russia , which retains a significant footprint in syria and was recently reported to be jamming u.s. drones operating in syrian airspace
this week , aides to president vladimir putin circled the wagons , deeming trump 's new wave of sanctions and promise of action in syria as the latest signs that russia faces a new era of geopolitical solitude and antagonism from the west
officials warned of a new cuban missile crisis in the levant and the prospect of a much more dangerous conflagration
that fear has helped guarantee assad 's position
but trump still has to chart a way forward , even if his administration 's plan is to simply cut and run after another one-off bombing
the prospect of the latter happening may not be as far-fetched as it sounds assad , if safely ensconced in power , will probably not want to provoke further israeli strikes nor seem overly dependent on foreign fighters
dobbins wrote in al-monitor
some syrians opposed to assad are resigned to that fate
