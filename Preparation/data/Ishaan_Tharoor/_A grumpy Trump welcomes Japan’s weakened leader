on tuesday , japanese prime minister shinzo abe will call on president trump at his florida resort for two days of meetings and meals
it may serve as a welcome reprieve for the duo abe and trump are both weathering scandals at home , with investigators and journalists poring over evidence of both leaders alleged cronyism
their latest summit at mar-a-lago the pair has already met twice during trump 's time in office may offer a brief window to change the conversation
but it may also crack the lid on a new and turbulent period of u.s.-japan relations
as my colleagues report , the trump administration has recently ruffled feathers in tokyo
first , abe 's government was alarmed by the white house 's decision to embrace talks with north korea and kick-start a diplomatic process that could downplay long-standing japanese concerns
then it was stung by trump 's decision not to grant japan waivers from new u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum , making japan the only major u.s. ally not to receive such an exemption
( washington granted seoul a waiver after revising the terms of their existing bilateral free-trade deal )

said clyde prestowitz , a top trade negotiator in the reagan administration , to the los angeles times
things you did n't see during trump 's visit to japan pm shinzo abe falling into the bunker during their round of golf
on north korea , the two countries have drifted apart since the last time trump and abe met
as the united states presses for north korea to denuclearize , tokyo is concerned the white house may risk lifting america 's security umbrella over the asia-pacific
in mar-a-lago , abe and his colleagues will seek assurances from trump that this is not the case
on trade , abe got a fleeting glimmer of hope last week when it emerged that trump was weighing a return to the trans-pacific partnership , the regional free-trade pact long supported by the japanese
one of trump 's first acts as president was withdrawing the united states from the agreement , which has since been reconstituted without washington as a central player
but trump quickly disappointed onlookers in tokyo , tweeting that japan would first have to negotiate a new bilateral trade deal with the united states
so far , the japanese have shown little appetite for such talks
would only join tpp if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to pres
we already have bilateral deals with six of the eleven nations in tpp , and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations , japan , who has hit us hard on trade for years
even if trump does somehow give abe the public guarantees he may seek , the japanese prime minister may not be long in his post
despite comfortably winning a new mandate in parliamentary elections last year , abe 's grip on power is slipping as he faces a pair of spiraling domestic scandals involving allegations that he helped friends at two educational institutions get special treatment from the government
over the weekend , tens of thousands of japanese protesters gathered in front of parliament , calling for the prime minister 's resignation the approval ratings of abe and his cabinet are at trumpian levels
junichiro koizumi , a long-ruling predecessor of abe , told a japanese reporter that the situation is getting dangerous for the prime minister and wondered whether he may choose to quit as early as this summer
abe 's every move in florida will be watched by the traveling japanese press corps , and trump may be in a position to hold out a sympathetic hand
but a misstep or disagreement could make the glare of the spotlight all the more harsh
