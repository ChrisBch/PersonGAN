a 7.3-magnitude earthquake shook the northern coast of venezuela on tuesday night , knocking items off supermarket shelves and causing tremors as far away as bogota , the colombian capital
authorities reported no casualties
but amid economic devastation and political havoc , the country is still feeling many other shocks
a popular satirical website tweeted that the earthquake was the result of a tectonic plate trying to flee venezuela a dark joke gesturing to the thousands of venezuelans seeking to escape the country every day
according to u.n. figures , some 2.3 million venezuelans about 7 percent of the population have left their homeland over the past couple of years
other estimates place the number at closer to 4 million

the exodus is the consequence of severe economic deprivation and mounting desperation among venezuelans
the countrys economy has shrunk by half in just five years , and inflation is nearing a staggering 1 million percent
shortages of food and medicine have led to a crisis in public health , with once-vanquished diseases such as diphtheria and measles returning and the rate of infant mortality rising sharply
u.n. officials claim that some 1.3 million venezuelans who left the country were suffering from malnourishment.
the stream of refugees is straining venezuelas neighbors as well
over the weekend , violence broke out in the northern brazilian town of pacaraima between venezuelan migrants and local mobs , which burned a number of squalid migrant encampments
but neither the anger of locals , who resent the burden of refugees in an already-impoverished part of the country , nor a beefed-up military presence on the border stopped hundreds more venezuelans from crossing into brazil every day this week
while the bulk of the refugees have crossed into colombia , many are moving on from there to other countries , including ecuador , peru and chile
peruvian officials say 20,000 venezuelans arrived there last week
on sunday , authorities in ecuador closed border crossings with colombia to venezuelans who do not have passports
many poor venezuelans do not have passports , which are increasingly difficult to obtain
dylan baddour , reporting on the crisis for the washington post , encountered members of one family stranded at the ecuadorian border who had sold their tvs , household appliances , a computer and a motorbike to finance their escape
it took that money plus scraped-together loans from relatives to buy bus tickets from venezuela to lima , the peruvian capital
now their attempt to find a semblance of a normal life was being cut short
on wednesday , ecuadorian officials called for an emergency regional summit so venezuela and its neighbors can collectively reckon with the crisis.
the capacity of the region is overwhelmed , said yukiko iriyama , a representative in colombia for the u.n. refugee agency.
the magnitude of the situation really requires a regional comprehensive approach
in venezuela , blame falls on president nicols maduro , whose government , through widespread graft and incompetence , transformed what was once one of the regions richest nations into a humanitarian calamity
my colleagues rachelle krygier and anthony faiola reported
if you 'd bought a million dollars in venezuela 's local currency when president nicols maduro came to power in 2013 , it 'd now be worth $ 3.40
the trump administration , meanwhile , has loudly condemned the maduro government and slapped sanctions on some of its leading officials
but at a time when white house officials are seeking to suspend refugee flows to the united states , they are hardly taking the lead on dealing with a hemispheric refugee crisis
the humanitarian plight of venezuelans rarely gets any real attention in the united states
the country is more often invoked by conservatives as a cautionary tale about the supposed perils of socialism , a parable they hope will scare u.s. voters away from left-wing democrats in the upcoming midterm elections
in an op-ed in the post , venezuelan commentator and vehement maduro critic francisco toro rejected this line of argument , pointing to the near-ubiquitous adoption of socialist policies across latin america by various governments at various times in history
nothing in these instances suggested the tragedy in venezuela was inevitable
