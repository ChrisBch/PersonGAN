president trump is unwittingly taking a page from cervantes
don quixote , the titular character of the spanish novelist 's legendary book , famously sallies forth on his bedraggled nag to fight a set of monstrous giants
likewise , trump seems more and more intent on tilting at the monstrous giants of his imagination
and , more and more , weary onlookers in washington including his own staff ca n't be blamed for empathizing with the harried sancho
that was the portrait painted by my colleagues philip rucker and robert costa in a front-page story over the weekend
the piece examined how trump has blasted through the stabilizers that once kept him in check
last year , trump 's twitter tirades were usually a weekly occurrence
now they seem to come every day
trump has been on a particular tear since easter , attacking foreign governments , domestic opponents , immigrants , online retailers and , of course , the mainstream media
we will protect our southern border
with some of those more extreme figures likely whispering encouragement , trump has returned to pushing his hard-line anti-immigration agenda
trump said during a tuesday meeting with the leaders of three baltic nations , who were likely more interested in what the united states could do on their borders with russia
this new dimension comes even while trump still rages at the scarecrows or windmills that animate his political base and fuel coverage in conservative media
trump 's recent tweets reflect much of the xenophobia and paranoia over both foreign threats and domestic treachery that underlay his campaign , and which still galvanize his hard-line support
but they do n't stand up to much scrutiny
the post 's fact checker compiled a comprehensive analysis of the fact-challenged assertions behind trump 's tweets
these include his debunked belief that spending billions of dollars on new border fortifications will stop drugs from pouring into his country , which my colleagues describe as a fantasy based on no facts
and while trump has scare-mongered over america 's inability to cope with a supposed influx of new arrivals , the numbers say that surge is a myth
trump has again fanned fears that u.s. immigration policies have weakened the country and led to public safety risks , even though illegal immigration is at some of the lowest levels in years , wrote my colleague david nakamura
on tuesday , trump again invoked the supposed threat of a caravan of mostly central american migrants snaking its way toward the united states
as noted in this space yesterday , the caravan is a publicity stunt aimed at drawing further attention to the migrants plight in a region wracked by gang violence and political instability
it has also now stalled in southern mexico , where mexican immigration officials caught up with the procession and are encouraging migrants contrary to trump 's claims to return home or apply for asylum where they are now
migrants in caravan gathering to see who gets 20 day temporary permits to stay in mexico to apply for legal status
that urging , of course , may not work.
there is a barbarous situation in our country , said santos alberto lino , who worked as an auto mechanic in honduras before joining the caravan , to my colleagues.
people want to live in peace and harmony
trump 's flailing on twitter , meanwhile , is entirely a reflection of his problems at home , not abroad
the post 's dan drezner suggested that trump needs to stick with his branding as an angry outsider given his paucity of legislative victories , the salacious and not-so-salacious scandals unfolding around him and his own inability to fund his long-desired wall
a politically weakened trump has pivoted back to branding , because it is his only option before the midterm elections , wrote drezner
he needs to ensure that his loyal base supporters are sufficiently energized to come out and vote gop in the midterms
an easy way for him to do that is through twitter rants
