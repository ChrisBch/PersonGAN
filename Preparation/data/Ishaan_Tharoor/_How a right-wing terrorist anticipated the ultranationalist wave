the terrorist is expressionless as he arrives at a camp full of trusting and cheerful teenagers
dressed as a police officer and bearing an arsenal of firearms , he proceeds to slaughter dozens
some victims , cowering in fear , are tricked by his instructions and get executed lying face down
others get shot in the back as they flee for safety
the terrorist himself meekly surrenders to the security forces who eventually corner him , receiving the clemency he refused to give others
the terrorist in question is anders behring breivik , who carried out the bloodiest massacre in modern norwegian history on july 22 , 2011
breivik detonated a car bomb in a government complex in oslo and then proceeded to the island of utoya , where members of the youth wing of norways center-left labour party had gathered for a retreat
his rampage led to 77 deaths
the massacre is the subject of a film by acclaimed british director paul greengrass that was released last week.
22 july offers an unflinching account of the attacks and then delves into what followed a court case that tested norways legal system and its patience , as an unrepentant hate-filled murderer was allowed to take the stand and revel in his crimes
breiviks actions were seen as those of a deranged , far-right lone wolf
a manifesto that he circulated before embarking on the killing spree railed against immigration , multiculturalism and the supposed marxism of the political establishment , quoting various members of the fringe far-right in europe and the united states
he styled himself as a crusading warrior of the knights templar and boasted of a network of comrades ready to take up arms alongside him though investigators never found much evidence of any such fellow travelers
22 july is now on netflix
in this film , academy award nominee paul greengrass brings you a story about hope , resilience , and the real people who fought against a hate that would have preferred to see them silenced
but seven years later , breivik no longer seems so isolated
across scandinavia , europe and even the united states , far-right , anti-immigrant politics are ascendant
speaking to todays worldview , greengrass said breiviks intellectual worldview has migrated closer to the political center
greengrass said in an interview last week while visiting washington
with president trump and others railing against globalists , immigrants and liberals , the suggestion is that we should be very disturbed , indeed
greengrass has made a veritable canon of films that dwell on political violence and terrorism , from irish sectarianism to somali piracy
he links 22 july to his 2006 movie united 93 , which recounts the events aboard a passenger jet seized by al-qaeda hijackers on 9/11
passengers fought back against the terrorists who had taken over the plane , which ultimately crashed in a wooded clearing in pennsylvania
breiviks manifesto though , thankfully , not yet his actions offer a window into the real peril facing liberal democracy
at an event marking the films release in washington , greengrass spoke alongside a number of former government officials and experts in right-wing radicalization
they argued the film ought to make the trump administrations moves to stoke ultranationalist politics in america as well as cut funding from federal programs aimed at tackling far-right domestic terrorism all the more alarming
gen. michael hayden , a former cia director in the george w. bush administration , warned that the line of discourse has shifted in the united states in worrying fashion
he said while european countries may be able to reach back to a more ethnocentric past , the united states is built on pluralism
if we no longer embrace the concepts upon which the united states was founded and turn instead to the politics of blood and soil , then the impact may be far greater and more destructive , hayden said
trump-supporting proud boys group will be investigated by new york hate crimes unit after violence in manhattan
in the united states and europe , such entreaties have fallen on deaf ears
voters irked by feelings of cultural resentment and deepening social inequity have opted for parties on the extremes and arent bothered by the scolding of establishment voices
greengrass describes what he deems the populist insurgency raging in the west like seeing a storm blow over buildings.
the question is whether the existing structures can withstand the assault
centrist politicians are being chastened or defeated in elections across the continent
jens stoltenberg , the norwegian prime minister during breiviks massacre and a heroic figure in 22 july , was drummed out of power in 2013
hes now the secretary general of nato , the military alliance widely disliked by the wests populists
breiviks life is now forever consigned to the confined space of prison
