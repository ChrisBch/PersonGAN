as the evidence mounts that saudi officials ordered the abduction and possible murder of journalist jamal khashoggi , the trump administration seems bent on protecting them
secretary of state mike pompeo conducted a lightning tour of the middle east this week , flying to the saudi and turkish capitals
he echoed saudi denials of culpability and backed riyadhs ongoing investigation into the disappearance of khashoggi , who has not been seen since entering the saudi consulate in istanbul on oct. 2
in private , turkish , u.s. and even saudi-linked sources have all said they believe khashoggi was killed there , though no government has publicly confirmed it
the grisly details of what saudi agents allegedly did to khashoggi , a dissident-in-exile and contributing columnist to the washington post , get worse by the day
on wednesday , the new york times , citing a senior turkish official , reported that khashoggi was beaten and gruesomely tortured , his fingers cut off and his body eventually beheaded and dismembered
both the washington post and the times confirmed the identities of at least some of the members of a saudi team reportedly dispatched to istanbul to apprehend khashoggi
some were members of saudi security services , and at least one has been photographed in close proximity to crown prince mohammed bin salman , the kingdoms de facto ruler and the man who potentially ordered the operation against khashoggi
just spoke with the crown prince of saudi arabia who totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their turkish consulate
he was with secretary of state mike pompeo ...
... during the call , and told me that he has already started , and will rapidly expand , a full and complete investigation into this matter
answers will be forthcoming shortly

he described the crown prince alternating between dark brooding and rampaging anger in the aftermath of khashoggis death
trump has himself already voiced the suggestion of rogue killers disappearing khashoggi
the president , his lieutenants in the white house and allies in right-wing media have continually stressed the importance of preserving washingtons alliance with riyadh , no matter the growing howls of outrage in washington over the kingdoms conduct
said trump a comparison kavanaugh may not appreciate
critics in washington are baffled by the administrations willingness to give the benefit of the doubt to the saudis
both lawmakers and analysts have argued that the lucrative arms and energy deals that underpin the u.s.-saudi relationship can no longer justify ignoring riyadhs abuses , which also include an extensive record of killing civilians in yemen and a sweeping crackdown on saudi civil society
saudi arabia has already shown that its bark may be worse than its bite
earlier this year , after canadian officials spoke against riyadhs arrests of activists , the saudis recalled their ambassador from ottawa and angrily threatened punitive measures
those have so far had minimal effect
this all comes down to the credibility of saudi threats , and the credibility of saudi threats is low , thomas juneau of the university of ottawa said to my colleague emily rauhala.
completely has the upper hand.
we take putins word he didnt interfere in 2016 election , kims he will denuclearize , and mbs that he had no role in khashoggi murder
if reagan was trust but verify , realdonaldtrump is trust and look away
sad to be sure , but also dangerous
with almost comic timing , foreign affairs published a new anti-iran manifesto by pompeo this week
the u.s. 's top diplomat heralded trumps moral clarity and eagerness to confront outlaw regimes , underscoring the vast double standard the white house applies to riyadh and tehran
try as they might , trump and his allies will struggle to shift the focus away from mbs , who has personally played a key role in the white houses project to build an anti-iran axis in the middle east
but the crown princes impulsiveness and aggressiveness he is the architect of a distracting regional dispute with qatar , as well as the intervention in yemen is becoming too much of a liability
now , even senior u.s. senators are calling for him to be sidelined
wrote daniel shapiro , a former u.s. ambassador to israel
in washington , theres also growing scrutiny of trumps business interests with the saudis
on wednesday , 11 senate democrats sent trump a letter demanding he fully disclose his and the trump organizations financial ties to the kingdom , which date back decades
