north korean leader kim jong un made a surprise visit to beijing on tuesday , marking the young despot 's first trip overseas since he came to power in 2011
a readout from china 's xinhua news agency of his exchanges with chinese president xi jinping indicated that the ground was being prepared for kim and president trump to hold talks over pyongyang 's nuclear weapons program
( tellingly , though , not a single north korean account had kim invoking denuclearization , the white house 's stated goal for the korean peninsula )
the trump administration greeted the news from beijing as a positive sign for further diplomacy
president trump indicated that he was looking forward to dialogue with pyongyang a marked reversal from last year 's fire and fury bluster and congratulated himself for applying the maximum sanctions and pressure that supposedly brought kim closer to the table
for years and through many administrations , everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the korean peninsula was not even a small possibility
now there is a good chance that kim jong un will do what is right for his people and for humanity
look forward to our meeting
received message last night from xi jinping of china that his meeting with kim jong un went very well and that kim looks forward to his meeting with me
in the meantime , and unfortunately , maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost
that may be the case , but it still remains profoundly unclear what concessions , if any , trump may win in putative talks with north korea
here are three major questions that loom over the proceedings , should they take place
is denuclearization actually feasible
complete denuclearization is the administration 's stated goal , but it is still a pipe dream
the north koreans have talked about denuclearization for years , but that has not stopped them from beefing up their nuclear arsenal and conducting numerous missile tests since trump took office
as kim and xi posed for pictures in beijing , a review of recent satellite imagery appeared to show a new north korean reactor that could generate plutonium coming online
for kim , the threat posed by north korean nuclear weapons is essential to his survival on the world stage , a deterrent to those who might actively entertain plans to instigate regime change
now , after talks with both the south koreans and the chinese , kim is trying to determine what leverage he may have in negotiations with the united states
wrote ankit panda , an expert on asia-pacific security issues
that could include a drawdown of american forces in south korea or even a broader withdrawal from northeast asia
this would be welcomed in beijing and moscow , but rejected by most policymakers in washington
panda noted , but one where it gives up its weapons in exchange for the united states withdrawing its nuclear shield from the peninsula and leaving altogether
here 's rfa cartoonist rebel pepper 's take on a recent unofficial visit to beijing by north korean leader kim jong un
during the visit , kim met with chinese president xi jinping
kim is also expected to meet with u.s. president donald trump , although no date has been set
what 's at stake for china
for beijing , the kim visit was an opportunity to reassert itself as the central player in any deliberations involving north korea
it 's also an important reminder to trump that china 's interests in the region are hardly the same as those of the united states , especially as beijing and washington draw lines in the sand ahead of a possible trade war
despite the reported frostiness between kim and xi and the wider apathy toward north korea felt by many chinese the two countries remain historic allies
chinese television footage of the xi-kim summit showed the north korean leader scribbling notes during their discussions , the junior scribe to the wiser , stronger mentor
a half-decade of somewhat tetchy relations with china , though , provided kim the platform to emerge as a force of his own
will john bolton undermine trump
the ascent of bolton , the bellicose former diplomat tapped to become trump 's national security adviser next month , led critics to warn of a new warmonger in chief in the white house
bolton has suggested that the united states should consider a first strike on north korea and offer no concessions should the two sides meet
bolton 's line may cut against trump 's instincts
the president 's unorthodox foreign-policy positions have led him , for example , to question the seemingly permanent u.s. military presence in the region something that hawks such as bolton would never consider a bargaining chip
