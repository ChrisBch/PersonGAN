the mystery surrounding jamal khashoggi has turned even more dark
the saudi journalist vanished oct. 2 after entering the saudi consulate in istanbul
within days , leaks from turkish officials suggested khashoggi had been killed by saudi agents flown in to take out the writer
the saudis have denied the accusation , saying khashoggi left the consulate on his own but have provided no evidence to back up their claim
wrote post national security reporter shane harris
on thursday , my colleagues reported that turkish officials told their u.s. counterparts that they had audio and video evidence apparently confirming their conclusion that khashoggi was killed in the saudi consulate
the news has gone off like a bomb in the u.s. capital , where riyadh has long curried favor through an extensive ecosystem of lobbyists , wonks and politicians
in the space of a week , khashoggis disappearance has stirred the sort of collective ire against saudi arabia that years of saudi-led bombing in yemen could not
if the saudi regime murdered jamal khashoggi , a journalist critic , in their own consulate , there must be accountability and an unequivocal condemnation by the united states
indeed , trump has done little to suggest that evidence of saudi misbehavior would compel him to disrupt his close relationship with the kingdom
in multiple interviews since khashoggis disappearance , he has stressed the importance of preserving over $ 100 billion in arms sales to the saudis
the following day , trump waved away the incident as something that took place in turkey involving a saudi citizen , and was therefore not any of washingtons business never mind that khashoggi was a u.s. resident writing for an american newspaper
the white houses indifference should not be a surprise
saudi arabia was the first country trump visited as president
he has since touted the kingdoms lavish spending on u.s. military hardware as well as its close partnership in a new axis to confront iran
trump has also decisively aligned u.s. policy with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates , which both reviled the 2011 pro-democracy uprisings in the middle east
riyadh and abu dhabi cheered the 2013 coup against the elected government of egyptian president mohamed morsi , a member of the muslim brotherhood , and have provided vast monetary assistance to the brutal regime of his successor , president abdel fatah al-sissi
i have great confidence in king salman and the crown prince of saudi arabia , they know exactly what they are doing ...
at an event in new york last month , anwar gargash , the uaes minister of state for foreign affairs , stressed that the gulf monarchies have an arch-conservative philosophy that prioritizes stability and rejects islamism
he said he resented a messianic view in many western capitals that imagined liberal democracy flourishing across the region
khashoggi , a former riyadh insider who chose to flee his country to express his views , was a staunch critic of the intolerant politics that snuffed out the possibility of more democratic arab societies

but if the obama administration struggled to reckon with political turmoil in the middle east , trump has made emphatically clear that he isnt interested in humoring democratic experiments at all
the disappearance of khashoggi only reinforces how much hes willing to ignore to back his strongman friends especially when it makes him rich
