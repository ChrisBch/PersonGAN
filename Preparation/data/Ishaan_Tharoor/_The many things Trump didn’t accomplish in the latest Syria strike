after days of speculation , the united states took action friday night to punish the syrian regime for a suspected chemical weapons attack a week prior
french , british and american forces launched a salvo of more than 100 missiles against three syrian regime targets , and u.s. officials claimed the attack significantly degraded the regime 's chemical-weapons program
despite rumblings of a more sustained air campaign against the regime of syrian president bashar al-assad , the strike echoed the one-off bombardment trump ordered one year ago
that attack also followed an alleged chemical-weapons attack , but what was meant to chasten the assad regime and its allies at the time did nothing of the sort
nevertheless , trump took to twitter to hail the efficacy of the strikes and declare mission accomplished
a perfectly executed strike last night
thank you to france and the united kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military
could not have had a better result
the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out , with such precision , that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term mission accomplished.
i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term , it should be brought back
that 's an unfortunate phrase for any american president with geopolitical ambitions in the middle east , but it 's particularly awkward for trump given that little seems to have been accomplished at all
there 's still uncertainty over what exactly was destroyed during this pinprick strike , with some reports indicating that assad 's ability to use chemical weaponry remains intact
meanwhile , assad 's supporters partied in the streets of damascus on saturday , waving syrian flags and holding up pictures of their leader
the attack , my colleague liz sly wrote , was interpreted in syria as a win for assad because the limited scope of the strikes suggested that western powers do not intend to challenge his rule
on sunday , the syrian military declared that it had taken full control over eastern ghouta
the area outside damascus was besieged for years by the assad regime and subject to alleged chemical-weapons attacks , including the assault this month that killed dozens of civilians and triggered u.s. action
that incident , according to reports , prompted the remaining rebels to surrender and agree to be evacuated out of the area
regime officials crowed on sunday that eastern ghouta was completely clear of terrorism.
rather than assad , it was trump who spent the weekend on edge
he is beset by scandals and intrigue , with his personal lawyer in the crosshairs of a federal probe and embarrassing tidbits from ousted fbi director james b. comey 's new book dominating the u.s. news cycle
the missile strike had offered trump another moment to shift media attention and signal how he has outdone his predecessor , who chose not to directly target the syrian regime for using chemical weapons in 2013
white house insiders told my colleagues that trump believes syria is in its current state because president barack obama did n't enforce his red lines
he canceled a planned visit to latin america to monitor the situation at home as the nation 's commander in chief
but then trump spent sunday raging against comey , whose comments featured in all the major television morning shows
the fleeting effects of the strike and trump 's lack of a real strategy for syria also exposed how thin his posturing may be , especially if assad manages to launch a new attack using nerve gas or other illicit weapons
my colleague greg jaffe explained
if assad ignores fridays relatively modest military strike and uses chemical weapons , trump faces a difficult choice
he can escalate , pulling the u.s. military and his administration into a messy conflict that he recently said he wanted to abandon
or he can do nothing and risk appearing weak
obama also faced this bind and tried to split the difference by supporting syrian rebels with billions of dollars in arms and other assistance while keeping the u.s. military from getting too deeply involved in the conflict
but trump moved to end support for rebels and is intent on withdrawing american troops from the country
despite his enthusiasm for friday 's air raid , he has little apparent interest in taking ownership of the syrian endgame
said sen. lindsey o. graham ( r-s.c. )
neoconservatives and hawks also placed trump on the same continuum of american fecklessness supposedly exemplified by obama
of course , there are many other analysts including senior military officials who are relieved that trump chose restraint over a potential conflagration
but the weekend 's events offered yet another reminder of the limits of washington 's scope for action within the grinding misery of the syrian war
