as votes were tallied in the early hours of monday , it seemed juncker 's worst-case scenario had arrived
about half the italian electorate voted for populist parties once considered fringe , and a stable government is nowhere in sight
there were two big winners the anti-establishment five star movement , founded less than a decade ago by a comedian , which won about 32 percent of the vote , and the league , a far-right , anti-immigrant , euroskeptic party
the league probably surpassed its center-right ally , the forza italia party of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi
meanwhile , the five star movement an anarchic faction encompassing euroskeptics , libertarians , progressives and a strong core of disenchanted youth voters became the single biggest party in italy
in the run-up to italy 's elections , much of the international media fixated on the storm clouds on the horizon
italian voters were disaffected and angry , fearful of hundreds of thousands of recently arrived migrants from the other side of the mediterranean and fed up with a lack of opportunities , the perceived corruption of elites and the inefficacy of the ruling centrist government
the front-runners in the polls included neo-fascists , a party of unpredictable euroskeptics and an aging former prime minister known for his infamous sex parties
the contours of the new regime are still unclear , but an old one is certainly passing
italian voters delivered an emphatic rejection to the preferred option of figures such as mosi a loveless grand coalition between berlusconi 's center-right faction and the democratic party of former prime minister matteo renzi
a populist alliance between the five star movement and the league , unthinkable just months ago , is now at least plausible
another scenario a coalition between the league and berlusconi 's forza italia could see league leader matteo salvini become the next prime minister
even in politically febrile italy , it would mark a remarkable turn of events
la mia prima parola grazie
but problems of policy will have to wait
the key theme underlying the election was an anti-e.u , anti-immigrant backlash that echoed the angry tribalism of elections elsewhere in the west
salvini , whose once-regional party has shifted its ire from southern italians to foreigners , wants to carry out mass deportations while radically refashioning the italian economy
he said while in italy last week , in clear support of salvini.
italy is the leader.
