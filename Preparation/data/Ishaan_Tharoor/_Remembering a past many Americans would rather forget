a prominent congressman blames a lack of jobs for americans on millions of immigrants
a far-right hate group accuses leftists and minorities of trying to suppress its freedom of speech
and , before thousands of cheering supporters , a populist orator asks his supporters to help restore america to americans.
these could easily be contemporary headlines in the united states but theyre not
all of these events took place in the 1930s , and i encountered them on newsreel footage that is part of a new exhibit at the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington
americans and the holocaust is a comprehensive accounting of the political conversation in the united states as the country observed the run-up to world war ii in europe and then entered the epochal conflict
americas role in defeating the axis powers and liberating nazi death camps dominates the countrys perception of the war
but , as the exhibit makes clear , popular imagination has glossed over a far more troubling and complicated history
the exhibit commences in the early 1930s , with american society ravaged by economic woes , chronic unemployment and racial tensions
it goes on from there , charting the political battles between isolationists and internationalists , communist sympathizers and zealous christian campaigners , jewish civil-society groups and the early proponents of extreme vetting.
ethnic germans hold pro-nazi rallies in u.s. cities anti-japanese agitators sport pins and tout licenses authorizing them to hunt japs on u.s. soil
just went through the holocaustmuseums terrific new exhibit on the united states before and during world war ii
here is the service cross of the german eagle awarded by hitler to charles lindbergh in 1938
there was rampant fear , particularly about immigrants and refugees
popular media was suffused with warnings and stories of a dangerous fifth column of alien undesirables stealing into america
lawmakers described unemployment as a problem transferred from foreign lands , urging deportations of foreign-born workers taking american jobs
he deserves our help more than the german child.
there was certainly some sympathy for jews and other persecuted groups , but american officials hardly took heroic steps to act on it
the exhibit showcases letters and petitions sent in support of granting visas for european jews , along with the correspondence that came back rejecting or advising against these applications
albert einstein , the great german-born scientist who eventually found safe haven in america , bemoaned how washington sought to make immigration impossible by erecting a wall of bureaucratic measures.
between 1933 and 1938 , the united states permitted a maximum of 25,957 visas to be given to german-born individuals each year
in practice , it issued far fewer
and even after the horrors of the holocaust were exposed and the war ended , only 5 percent of americans in 1945 believed it was right to expand refugee quotas
the echoes of the present are so loud they barely need be mentioned
politicians , from the white house down to the lowest offices , have railed against the supposed threats of immigration to america , whether economic , demographic or terrorism-related
as the war in syria drags on and global humanitarian crises have mounted , the united states has lowered its refugee quotas and ground the admission of syrian asylum seekers to a standstill
anti-semitism has again become a disturbingly regular feature of politics
theres a misconception that americans did not have information about the holocaust as it occurred
as part of history unfolded , people across the us research in local archives to uncover what their community knew about the nazi threat & the holocaust
coughlin once said
he defended the nazis after the kristallnacht pogrom against jews throughout nazi germany in 1938 and , not unlike his descendants on right-wing american talk radio today , focused his ire on devious atheists , leftists and foreign interlopers
at a rally of close to 20,000 people in new york city , coughlin urged his supporters to work to restore america to americans.
his brand of isolationism , shared by the like-minded america first committee , would die out over the course of the war
but his arguments carry the very vocabulary of trumpism
as an institution , the holocaust museum in washington feels a responsibility for the present for example , its scholars warned of the threat of ethnic cleansing in burma long before last year 's rampages against beleaguered rohingya muslims
the monument 's creator , bryan stevenson , told the post 's fred hiatt.
but we do have to face it.
