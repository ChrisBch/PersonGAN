the situation in venezuela is not improving
months of mass protests last summer were ultimately subdued by an increasingly authoritarian government , which replaced venezuela 's opposition-filled congress with a new constituent assembly stacked with loyalists of president nicols maduro
the body deployed sweeping powers to cow dissent and paved the way for a new set of elections , including a snap presidential vote , to be held in april
all of those moves have been rejected by most of the international community , which views any election in the current climate of intimidation as a fraudulent farce
maduro , however , is undeterred , and his opponents remain perpetually divided
while opposition parties are boycotting the elections , one former venezuelan state governor , henri falcon , announced his presidential candidacy on tuesday , giving maduro a somewhat credible challenger and the election a paper-thin veneer of legitimacy
despite the opposition spending months engaged in rounds of internationally mediated talks with maduro 's government , there 's no political breakthrough anywhere in sight
all the while , stories of degradation and deprivation come out of venezuela at a relentless clip
there are lurid tales of prison inmates foraging for dead rats , pumas and lions wasting away in venezuelan zoos , and mothers embarking on harrowing cross-border trips just to find medicine for their children
as many as 4 million venezuelans more than 10 percent of the population have already left the country , according to the brookings institution
that 's an exodus on a similar scale to the one seen in war-torn in syria
according to u.n. statistics from last november , more than 600,000 venezuelans have fled to colombia , 5,000 to the caribbean isle of curacao , 20,000 to aruba , 30,000 to brazil and 40,000 to trinidad and tobago
while president trump has spoken angrily about maduro 's excesses and slapped new penalties on the venezuelan regime , the united states has not taken the lead in working to mitigate a spiraling humanitarian disaster
venezuela 's crisis a historic disaster for what used to be one of latin america 's wealthiest nations could be an epilogue to the socialist experiment launched by president hugo chvez
chvez used the nation 's vast oil wealth to lift millions out of poverty , but he presided over a system of cronyism and corruption that has potentially enfeebled the country for a generation
he said in early february
said miguel henrique otero , a journalist critical of the regime , to krauze
in the meantime , maduro and his allies continue to point the finger at the imperialist meddling of outside powers ( read the united states ) while fanning the flames of nationalist populism
maduro constantly seeks to channel chvez 's legacy , though few consider him a convincing heir
