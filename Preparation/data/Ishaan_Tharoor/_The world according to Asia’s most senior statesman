new york at 93 , malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad was the most venerable statesman to appear at the united nations this week
hes the last survivor of an old guard of towering southeast asian leaders , including figures like singapores lee kuan yew and indonesias suharto
before returning to power with a dramatic election victory in may , mahathir had governed as prime minister between 1981 and 2003
when he delivered his last speech from the dais of the u.n. 's general assembly 15 years ago , president trump wasnt even a reality-television star yet
on friday , mahathir will address the assembly again
in an interview with todays worldview this week , the prime minister said he will focus on the importance of strengthening democracy and democratizing the international system
its the same theme he addressed in his 2003 speech , where he , like other non-western leaders , called for the restructuring of an international system dominated by a handful of powers
tun dr mahathir mohamads first bilateral meeting in new york was with his excellency hassan rouhani , president of the islamic republic of iran
they talked about improving relationship between the two countries , the state of the muslim world and other bilateral issues
in recent weeks , mahathir has earned attention for attempting to buck this trend
his new government canceled two multibillion-dollar chinese investment projects , a move perceived by analysts as a rejection of beijings geopolitical ambitions in asia
but mahathir pushed back on any suggestion that he was anti-chinese
he condemned the imminent trade war between the united states and china as silly , old-fashioned and something beijing does not want
he also looks dourly upon trump , a new antagonist in the white house
mahathir argued that he canceled the chinese contracts in questions not as an act of defiance against china , but because the debt-laden deal didnt serve the national interest and was the work of his allegedly corrupt predecessor , prime minister najib razak
mahathirs return to the world stage followed a remarkable election campaign this year to unseat najib , a former mahathir protege
popular discontent with malaysias political status quo , intensified by spiraling corruption scandals surrounding najib , compelled his mentor to head up an opposition coalition and bring down the ruling party he had dominated for decades
in a high-stakes contest in malaysia , he argued , the vote was respected
tun dr mahathir then had a dialogue session with members of the council on foreign relations ( cfr_org ) , where he spent nearly an hour answering questions from the audience
topics include china , trump administration , asean and the rohingya issue ,
there are profound ironies about this turn of events
for years , mahathir was viewed by many as an autocrat in democratic clothing , a charismatic politico who ruthlessly consolidated power even as he pioneered his nations modernization
he is still irked by this characterization , casting it as a trick played by the western media
nor does he take any responsibility for the political legacy he may have bequeathed to his country a certain political elite engaging in astonishing graft , enabled in part by a compromised judiciary
since leaving office in 2003 , mahathir has become a vocal critic of his successors
he said his government will work toward cleaning up the countrys judiciary and reviving foreign investment
in the 1990s , mahathir was the chief proponent of asian values , a set of principles that challenged the universality of human rights and seemed to justify authoritarian governance if it delivers prosperity and development
now , he has softened his rhetoric to fit his new democratic bona fides
mahathir then added trump is what happens with democracy
malaysias nonagenarian leader is eager to avoid any more talk about dictatorship at home
he came to power on a pledge to eventually cede office to once-jailed opposition leader anwar ibrahim , a politician who mahathir targeted for prosecution 20 years ago
theyve since buried the hatchet , and mahathir told todays worldview that he will give way to anwar in two or three years.
he ended on a matter-of-fact note i dont want to stay forever.
