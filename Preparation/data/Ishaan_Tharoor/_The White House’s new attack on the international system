in his first major policy address since joining the white house in april , national security adviser john bolton offered a particularly aggressive demonstration of president trump 's america first agenda
he threatened the international criminal court , a u.n.-mandated body based in the hague , with punitive measures should it pursue an investigation into alleged u.s. war crimes in afghanistan
he warned that the united states would ban icc judges and prosecutors from entering the country , sanction their funds in the u.s. financial system and punish any company or government that complies with an icc investigation into americans
in effect , bolton declared that these officials including respected jurists and rights activists could receive the same treatment as certain kremlin-linked oligarchs or shadowy financiers of extremist groups
bolton outright urged the collapse of the icc , casting it as a cabal of unaccountable foreign bureaucrats not unlike the language used by right-wing populists to tar european union officials
like them , bolton explicitly attacked the global governance dogma of the bloc and hailed britain 's decision to leave it

the tough rhetoric reflected bolton 's long-standing animosity toward the icc , an institution he lobbied against while serving in the george w. bush administration
bolton and some republican allies see the organization 's powers as an illegitimate infringement of national sovereignty and a supposed violation of american constitutional rights
in truth , the icc has little jurisdiction over the united states , which , like other major powers including india and china , never ratified the convention that established the court
in his remarks , bolton poured scorn on the court for seeking to exercise supranational powers over the united states and mocked it as a toothless instrument of justice
the hard men of history are not deterred by fantasies of international law such as the icc , he said
the idea that faraway bureaucrats and robed judges would strike fear into the hearts of the likes of saddam hussein , hitler , stalin , and gaddafi is preposterous , even cruel
instead , bolton extolled the righteous might of the united states and its allies as the only deterrent to evil and atrocity in the world
it was a tidy summation of his worldview , anchored by an ironclad faith in american military power and a deep suspicion of the international bodies that could check it
bolton also announced the shuttering of the washington office of the palestine liberation organization , in part because palestinian leaders had called on the icc to investigate israel 's expansion of settlements in the west bank
it 's yet another nail hammered by trump into the coffin of the middle east peace process
dr. saeb erekat on the announcement to close the palestinian mission in washington this dangerous escalation shows that the us is willing to disband the international system in order to protect israeli crimes
but for bolton and other trump administration officials , american misdeeds or deeds in general are not the business of outsiders
the new broadside against the icc follows steps by the administration challenging international cooperation in other areas , my colleagues reported
this year , the administration has withdrawn from the u.n. human rights body and threatened to pull out of the world trade organization , in addition to halting u.s. funding for the u.n. body that aids palestinian refugees
the announcement angered the trump administration , but it was welcomed by other american practitioners of international law
this policy would not only protect american interests by promoting the moral authority of the united states but it is also the most credible and expedient way to put the allegations to rest
it 's certainly true that the icc is far from a perfect institution critics , for example , point to its disproportionate prosecution of african officials
but it still represents a key cog in the international system , and one that could yet provide justice for the hideous crimes of those like syrian president bashar al-assad or myanmar 's generals
instead , it may yet become another casualty of trump 's wider war on liberal internationalism
it is an all-out bid by donald trump to end the icc , the worlds foremost criminal tribunal , and with it , the very concept of international justice , wrote the guardian 's simon tisdall
bolton is the man wielding the knife
and there is a strong possibility they will succeed
