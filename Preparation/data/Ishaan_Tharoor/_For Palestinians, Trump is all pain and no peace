president trump has insisted that he can forge the deal of the century and make peace between israelis and palestinians
but in practice , his administration has done little more than back the positions of israels right-wing government
in doing so , trump and his lieutenants have laid the groundwork for a dramatic shift away from long-standing u.s. policy and made peace all the less likely
last week , the state department confirmed that it was permanently cutting more than $ 200 million in aid to palestinians , part of a larger tranche of cuts to foreign aid
the trump administration is also stepping up its offensive against unrwa , the u.n. agency that provides aid for millions of palestinians in the west bank and gaza as well as lebanon , jordan and syria
there are even rumors that the administration may completely shut down its funding for unrwa as early as next week
trumps apparent disregard for the plight of palestinians should be no surprise
trump has never hidden his affinity for israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , who welcomed trumps election in 2016 , endorsed his vision for a wall along the mexican border and cheered his unraveling of the nuclear deal with iran
in various meetings , they have hailed their close friendship and like-minded views
it 's not only pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing , but also many other countries , and others
as an example , we pay the palestinians hundred of millions of dollars a year and get no appreciation or respect
they dont even want to negotiate a long overdue ...
among those is ambivalence about the prospect of an independent palestinian state
key ministers within netanyahus coalition openly oppose the quest for palestinian statehood , the policy solution long sought by washington
david friedman , trumps ambassador to israel , is an avid supporter of jewish settlements in the west bank
prior to his appointment , he wrote columns calling for the end of the two-state narrative.
trumps own signature act on israel recognizing jerusalem as the capital of the jewish state is seen by palestinians as a dismissal of their claims to both east jerusalem and statehood altogether
now the white house is moving to squeeze the palestinians even further
an investigation by foreign policy earlier this month published leaked emails written by jared kushner , trumps son-in-law and one of his designated envoys for the peace process
in them , kushner discloses his desire to undermine , if not wholly dismantle , unrwa , an institution detested by the israeli right
kushner wrote in one email , dated jan. 11.
this agency perpetuates a status quo , is corrupt , inefficient and doesnt help peace
that argument is popular among pro-israel hawks in washington and netanyahus supporters in israel , who see the institutions that define the palestinian status quo , including unrwa and the palestinian authority , as anti-israel cash cows
they specifically resent the u.n. agency for giving refugee status to millions of palestinians who were not expelled from the land that is now israel but rather born to families who were
kushner and other trump administration officials are reportedly seeking to strip such refugees of their status in order to weaken unrwas regional mandate
but breaking things would spell real harm for palestinians
in parts of the occupied territories , unrwa provides vital medical care and education services
in the west bank alone , its schools and vocational centers instruct close to 50,000 pupils
in gaza , close to a half a million palestinian refugees receive unrwa food aid
from cancer treatment to food assistance to anti-radicalization programs , trump 's aid cuts will have a devastating impact on palestinian women , children and families
instead , trumps pressure campaign could empower extremists , collapse the palestinian authority and pose new security risks for israel , warned peter lerner , a former spokesman for the israeli military
