at a handover ceremony held in a berlin church on wednesday , namibian officials received the remains of indigenous people killed in their country by german forces more than a century ago
the grisly contents included 19 skulls , a scalp and bones belonging to five skeletons , all of which had been housed for decades on dusty shelves in german universities and museums
the remains are a visceral link to a hideous past what many historians recognize as the first genocide of the 20th century
between 1904 and 1908 , colonial forces in what was then german south west africa carried out the widespread massacre of herero and nama tribespeople
estimates suggest as many as 80 percent of the nomadic herero tribe believed to number around 100,000 a century ago perished , either killed by german soldiers or left to die of thirst and starvation in the desert
the following year , he issued a similar warning concerning the nama some 10,000 are believed to have been killed
the violence and indignity did not end there
moved by the racist eugenics of the time , german authorities shipped thousands of skulls and other body parts of the aboriginal dead back to europe
the specimens were subjected to studies that formed the basis for now-discredited theories of european racial superiority
many of the skulls belonged to tribesmen left to die in squalid concentration camps in the desert their bodies were beheaded
in some instances , according to a 2011 article in der spiegel , widows were ordered to use shards of glass to scrape the flesh off their husbands heads so as to better prepare the skulls for transport
germany returns skulls from colonial-era massacre to namibia
the vileness of these acts is part and parcel of a far broader history
the germans were hardly alone in slaughtering local populations or hoarding the body parts of slain natives
myriad museums , clinics and universities in europe still house remains of colonized peoples , who were sometimes killed explicitly for the purpose of augmenting these morbid collections
the french culture minister said then
given the lengths to which its government has atoned for nazi-era horrors , germany is in some ways ahead of the curve compared with other western european countries
but critics say much still needs to be done to reckon with germanys colonial history , which spanned territories from africa to the south pacific
efforts are underway to do so , as my colleagues james mcauley and rick noack reported earlier this year
in france , germany and elsewhere , curators and government officials are thinking critically about the provenance of some of the artifacts in their midst
french president emmanuel macron has already announced plans to return , in some instances permanently , objects including masks , thrones , scepters and statues that had been looted by europeans
in germany , too , a similar project is unfolding
but this sort of reckoning , say critics , can only be a beginning
in the case of the herero , many in namibia are awaiting a formal german apology for the genocide of their ancestors
officials in berlin committed in 2016 to extending an apology , but they are still in negotiations with the namibian government over the wording of an official statement
analysts say the german government doesnt want to commit to an apology that could make it liable for reparations
on wednesday , michelle mntefering , the minister of state at the german foreign office , said that germany is firmly committed to its historic responsibility and asked the namibian delegation for forgiveness , but stopped short of an official apology
germany to return remains - but not sorry for namibia genocide
but he will likely be disappointed
european governments are notoriously averse to offering formal apologies , while the right-wing populists ascendant in countries such as france , britain and germany inflamed by various forms of imperial nostalgia decry the supposed shame complexes of the left
germanys far-right afd has even urged its compatriots to get over their guilt cult about nazi-era crimes
so the project of reconciliation and atonement rumbles on , slowly and unevenly
on wednesday , petra bosse-huber , a german protestant bishop , called the handover of the remains an act that should have been done many years ago.
for the herero , and for the countless other victims of europes empires , it still seems too little and plenty late
