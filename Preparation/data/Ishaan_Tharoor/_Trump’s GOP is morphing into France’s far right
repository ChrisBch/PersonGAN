the conservative political action conference , an annual conclave of the american right , is underway just outside washington
but it has not gone off without controversy
marion marchal-le pen , the youthful niece of french far-right heavyweight marine le pen , also addressed the gathering thursday
her appearance dismayed some establishment republicans , who were not eager to associate with a political faction linked to the dark remnants of european fascism
the acceptance of people such as marchal-le pen and british anti-immigrant campaigner nigel farage , who is speaking friday , seemed to underscore the hard-rightward drift of the republican party
and as trump goes , so goes his party
marchal-le pen displayed much of that paranoia and xenophobia during her 10-minute speech.
france is no longer free today , the 28-year-old said
after 1500 years of existence , we now must fight for our independence
she went on to bash the european union , earning cheers from the cpac crowd
her remarks echoed trump 's own blood-and-soil rhetoric over the past year
i 'm not offended when realdonaldtrump says america first

she decried what she called the scourge of immigration , bashed globalization , signaled a desire to quit nato and cozy up to russia , gestured at her opposition to same-sex marriage , and championed the historical continuity of her nation
on one level , it was the boilerplate nationalism you would expect from someone in her position
even her critics may argue that inviting her was largely harmless
a year ago , marchal-le pen was a much more attractive political prospect her aunt 's national front was poised to challenge in national elections in france , riding a right-wing populist wave through europe
but by the summer , the national front had been soundly beaten by the centrist emmanuel macron and its leadership plunged into bitter infighting
marchal-le pen herself , deflated in defeat , stepped aside from politics and the public spotlight
her appearance on the stage at cpac marked something of a return
( its still hard to see what she gains at home by addressing this audience abroad public opinion polling regarding trump in france finds widespread disapproval of the american president , even among national front voters )
benjamin haddad , a european politics expert at the conservative hudson institute in washington , said such a reading completely misses the point.
marchal-le pen has indeed clashed with her aunt
she is also closer to her grandfather , jean-marie le pen , the national front 's founder who has a long record of holocaust denial and other bigotry
marine le pen 's efforts to woo a broader section of working-class voters compelled her to distance herself both from her father and her niece
haddad told today 's worldview
marion distanced herself from her aunt because she thinks her aunt is too moderate , not the other way around.
nevertheless , the far right has left its imprint on french politics
more mainstream politicians on the center-right are aping le pens brand of identity politics
that is a phenomenon all too familiar to those watching trump 's america and the events unfolding in washington this week
