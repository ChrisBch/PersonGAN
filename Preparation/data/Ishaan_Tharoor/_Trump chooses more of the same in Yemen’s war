in washington , opposition has been mounting to saudi arabias ruinous role in yemens civil war
there is widespread outrage over grisly incidents in which civilians have died at the hands of a saudi-led military coalition , including a missile strike last month that killed dozens of schoolchildren
but the trump administration is endorsing the coalitions apparent efforts to cut down on such deaths
on wednesday , secretary of state mike pompeo certified to congress that saudi arabia and the united arab emirates had shown demonstrable actions to limit casualties in their campaign against yemens houthi rebels
pompeo was forced to make this declaration after congress established a legal requirement earlier this year for the administration to answer for the conduct of the war in yemen
failing that , the united states would have to restrict its assistance to the saudis , which includes refueling coalition aircraft operating against the iran-backed houthis
the war in yemen , as readers of todays worldview know , is entering its fifth year , and it has exacted an immense humanitarian toll
in addition to innocents killed by airstrikes , a significant proportion of the countrys population is suffering from hunger and malnutrition , exacerbated by the coalitions blockade of yemeni ports
a recent u.n. report suggested all sides were probably guilty of war crimes in a conflict that has claimed some 10,000 lives already
the trump administration has been clear that ending the conflict in yemen is a national security priority

the statement read.
we will continue to work closely with the saudi-led coalition to ensure saudi arabia and the uae maintain support for u.n.-led efforts to end the civil war in yemen
but peace is nowhere on the horizon
the latest round of u.n.-brokered talks in geneva ended in failure last week , and the trump administration is far more focused on the supposed iranian threat than the suffering of the yemeni people
pompeo and other trump lieutenants , including u.n
ambassador nikki haley , have sought to shift the focus to the houthis ability to fire missiles at saudi arabia and place the onus on iran to curb its behavior
those same leaders have shown little sign of contrition over the wars conduct
on wednesday , saudi and emirati forces renewed their siege of the crucial port city of hodeida , which is still under houthi control
but after a backlash over its indiscriminate airstrikes , the coalition has said it revised its rules of engagement , and ryan reported that u.s. officials have been encouraged by that reaction
others arent so sure.
its a rubber stamp for saudi arabia , said sen. elizabeth warren ( d-mass )
of pompeos decision
for each day that we continue our involvement in the yemen conflict that congress never authorized , we are complicit in the suffering and human rights abuses.lets end the cycle of violence by withdrawing from this proxy war where we have no stake
the senators , echoing a growing consensus among their colleagues , said it was a moral imperative to ensure the saudi-led coalition stops killing civilians.
