the targets of president trump 's tweeted wrath are legion
they include online retail giant amazon , the democratic party , the federal bureau of investigation , the mainstream media and undocumented immigrants known as dreamers
but even among them , mexico holds a special place of honor
trump , of course , launched his presidential campaign with an infamous slur against mexicans and a promise to fortify the border using mexican money
there have been endless complaints about mexican trade , attacks on a mexican judge ( a native-born american , in fact ) and any number of other broadsides
so it 's hardly a surprise that on sunday and monday mornings possibly provoked by fox news coverage as well as ultranationalist white house aide stephen miller trump again focused his rage on the nation to the south
what followed was a blizzard of misinformation
mexico is doing very little , if not nothing , at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border , and then into the u.s
they laugh at our dumb immigration laws
they must stop the big drug and people flows , or i will stop their cash cow , nafta
these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of daca
they want in on the act
mexico is making a fortune on nafta ... they have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic
with all of the money they make from the u.s. , hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours , at least until congress changes our immigration laws
the big caravan of people from honduras , now coming across mexico and heading to our weak laws border , had better be stopped before it gets there
cash cow nafta is in play , as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen
congress must act now
trump attacked mexico for supposedly allowing drug smugglers and hordes of migrants to rush over the border
( there 's no evidence of increased flows , and mexico in many ways is doing washington 's dirty work on its own southern border )
he then tethered his skepticism over daca an obama-era policy that exempts hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought illegally to the united states as children to the imagined threat that new undocumented arrivals would seek to claim the same status
( that 's just not how it works )
trump then referred to caravans of migrants marching through mexico to the u.s. border
( there is , in fact , only one such caravan , an annual activist stunt aimed at generating media attention for asylum seekers and migrants from central america )
and , for good measure , he threatened to stop the cash cow that is the north american free trade agreement , which he is bent on either renegotiating or jettisoning as part of his america first agenda
in the face of this onslaught , mexican foreign minister luis videgaray tweeted a polite response
every day mexico and the u.s. work together on migration throughout the region
facts clearly reflect this , he wrote , referring to trump 's frenzy over caravans
an inaccurate news report should not serve to question this strong cooperation
upholding human dignity and rights is not at odds with the rule of law
but it 's not clear how much longer mexico 's leadership will be as measured as videgaray
as trump fumed in his florida mansion on sunday , the mexican presidential campaign formally got underway , and all the leading candidates took the opportunity to bash the tweeter in chief next door
conservative challenger ricardo anaya said he would confront trump with a strong and dignified stance
he struck back at trump 's complaints over the border , linking u.s. gun laws to cartel violence that afflicts parts of mexico
eighty percent of the guns used to kill people in our country come from the united states , he said
last month , while campaigning among mexicans in california , anaya decried the apparent timidity of videgaray 's boss , president enrique pea nieto , in the face of trump 's bullying
he also offered solidarity with mexican migrants living in the united states
.realdonaldtrump , are n't you debriefed every day
nafta is a win-win scenario , which has made not only mexico but the u.s. and canada , the most thriving region in the world
the u.s. has a deficit with almost every country , mainly because you import more than you export
indeed , trump 's seeming hostility to mexico has led to a nationalist turn in the mexican presidential race
the biggest beneficiary is andrs manuel lpez obrador , a left-wing populist who is polling a whopping 18 points ahead of anaya and 22 points in front of ruling-party candidate jos antonio meade
with the exception of former president vicente fox , who has practically made mocking trump his full-time job , no leading mexican politician has been as vociferous in his condemnation of the u.s. president as the former mexico city mayor and veteran campaigner
lpez obrador , 64 , blends that defiant nationalism with populist resentment over the systemic graft that still shapes mexican society and politics what he calls the mafia of power
it 's a stigma that pea nieto and his ruling party have been unable to shake
neither security issues nor social problems can be resolved with walls , lpez obrador said in juarez , attacking trumps mistaken foreign policy and contemptuous attitude toward mexicans.
mexico is now a democracy , but there is profound discontent with its results
most mexicans resent , and rightfully , the meager economic growth of the past few decades and the persistence of poverty and inequality , historian enrique krauze wrote in the new york times last month
and four terrible problems complicate this situation violence , insecurity , impunity and corruption
in the face of this desolating balance sheet , the natural reaction in any democracy is to punish the government in power
some american and mexican critics to the right of lpez obrador style him as a hugo chvez-in-waiting and a danger to the u.s.-mexican relationship
his disciplined campaign , after narrow defeats in the past , suggest those fears are possibly overblown
and in the age of trump , his populism hardly seems any more a threat to the north american status quo than the politics that have taken root in the white house
the two may prove one another 's best enemies
if lopez obrador wins and meets his vow to respond harshly to trumps tirades against mexico , trump would be able to tell his base 'you see , i told you so
mexico is not a friendly nation , miami herald columnist andrs oppenheimer wrote
the two nationalist-populist presidents would feed one another and help each other with their respective political bases with an escalating war of words
