a new report from the bill and melinda gates foundation warns that rapid population growth in the worlds poorest countries may slow or even reverse the international communitys fitful efforts to combat global poverty
we want people to understand that that progress is not inevitable , said melinda gates in an interview with todays worldview
the report argues that more investments in health and education are needed in the developing world to make sure that surging populations turn into a demographic blessing rather than a curse
the problems are particularly acute in africa the report notes that by 2050 , 40 percent of the worlds poorest people will live in the democratic republic of congo and nigeria alone
progress is possible
its up to us to make it happen
lets start by investing in young peoples potential

the report tracks 18 data points linked to the u.n.s sustainable development goals , ranging from child and maternal mortality and incidences of malaria to sanitation and access to banking
this years edition focused in particular on four major challenges family planning and access to contraceptives a cause gates said is dear to her heart improving education in low-income countries , fighting hiv rates and boosting agricultural productivity
a series of case studies in the report spotlights precedents for success
for example , though its gross domestic product is a sliver of that of many western nations , vietnams significant funding of education has enabled its high school students to outperform u.s. and european counterparts in international science and math tests
zimbabwe was once one of the nations most ravaged by the hiv epidemic in 1997 , one out of four adults was believed to be infected
but since 2010 , new hiv infections are down almost 50 percent and aids-related deaths are down by 45 percent , largely due to the efforts of government and civil society programs backed by international donors
gates said the world needs to uplift young people in its most benighted corners.
if we make the right investments for those young people provide access to contraceptives , quality schooling they will prosper , they will make society better , she said
the gates foundation is a philanthropic behemoth , which has presided over huge investments in the spread of vaccines that have arguably saved tens of millions of lives
but gates admits that its efforts absolutely depend on political leadership around the world
one example is france , which is hosting a major replenishment conference of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria next year
the conference could net huge financial commitments from major world powers and donors
even in tough political times , gates said , many wealthy countries have maintained steady commitments to global health
but in the case of the united states , where the trump administration is seeking to gut humanitarian aid and has rolled back funding for reproductive-rights projects abroad , gates expressed dismay
she said , adding that she still had faith in lawmakers in congress to support international aid projects
and a roll back in combating poverty is all too real if governments are unable to address the needs of their booming populations
what keeps melinda and me optimistic about the world
our belief in the power of innovation to redefine whats possible and in the ability of young people to drive economic growth and social progress goalkeepers18
she said , citing significant dips in rates of child mortality as well as malnutrition and successful development initiatives in countries as disparate as indonesia and ethiopia
