the once-unthinkable nearly became reality sunday
jair bolsonaro , a far-right politician sometimes likened to president trump , nearly won an outright majority of the vote in the first round of brazils presidential election
had he succeeded , he would have clinched the presidency
instead , he is the clear favorite in the runoff scheduled for oct. 28
it wasnt long ago that the bruising and divisive bolsonaro , a 63-year-old ex-paratrooper , was a fringe figure with little hope of winning power in brasilia
even in the weeks running up to sundays vote , experts suggested that the countrys political process would curb his ascent
a second round would see voters rally behind a more mainstream challenger a national legislature stacked with opponents would force bolsonaro to moderate his hard-line positions
but a surge in support for bolsonaros angry , anti-establishment politics also upended brazils congress , with his once-obscure social liberal party running a close second to the leftist workers party of jailed former president lula incio da silva
a host of veteran politicians two-thirds of incumbents were swept out , while a new , upstart generation that includes celebrity youtubers is poised to enter the countrys lower house
juliano griebeler , a political analyst at barral m jorge , a business consultancy , said to bloomberg news
how brazil 's congress ( the lower house ) changed last night
bolsonaro 's party jumped to second place , behind haddad and lula 's workers party , and the traditional center / center-right parties were crushed
bolsonaro got to this moment on the back of years of incendiary politicking
as weve already detailed , he is notorious for his outbursts of bigotry , launching diatribes against minorities , immigrants , women and lgbt brazilians
he cast himself as the law-and-order candidate , declaring that he would give police greater license to kill criminals with impunity and make it easier for ordinary brazilians to acquire their own firearms
as an evangelical christian , he courted religious voters and pandered to conservative culture warriors
and he benefited from widespread anger at the countrys political class , which is engulfed in a vast corruption scandal
tweeted brian winter , the editor in chief of americas quarterly.
its a global story , but especially pronounced here.
the implications of bolsonaros success are huge and , to many observers , grim
bolsonaro has talked nostalgically of the decades when brazil was ruled by a murderous right-wing dictatorship and hailed former military officers implicated in the torture of leftist political prisoners
he once said that the dictatorships greatest failing was not killing more of them

wrote financial times columnist gideon rachman
to many brazilians , haddad , bolsonaros opponent , seems unlikely to lead that fight
his left-wing workers party , particularly under lulas wildly popular administration , presided over a huge economic boom that lifted millions of brazilians out of poverty
but key figures in its leadership were later implicated , alongside most of brazils establishment , in the countrys endemic graft
glauco peres , a political scientist at the university of sao paolo , said to the guardian.
hell keep hammering away at this idea of fear that the workers party represents a step backwards into corruption scandals and having criminals in government
unlike the larger-than-life lula , who is still a left-wing icon , haddad is a shy , pragmatic economist , wrote my colleagues anthony faiola and marina lopes
they noted that he has tried to reassure investors that he would not pursue radical leftist policies , but many still worry he would not pass the tough reforms seen as necessary to avoid another economic crisis here
wrote robert muggah , co-founder of a rio de janeiro-based think tank.
alternatively , they can preserve and renew their young democracy.
