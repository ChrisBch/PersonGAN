for hungarian prime minister viktor orban , his appearance at the european parliament on tuesday was a voyage into the belly of the beast
all of those charges were enumerated in a recent e.u
report , which is the basis of a resolution calling for hungarys censure and an investigation into whether budapest has breached core e.u
will you let it happen that a government
violates the values on which this union was built without consequences
asked judith sargentini , the dutch member who compiled the report.
or will you ensure that the values of this union are more than just words written on a piece of a paper
members of the parliament will vote on the resolution on wednesday
if a two-thirds majority goes against hungary , it could trigger a process that may lead to sanctions and the stripping of hungarys voting rights within the continental bloc
he declared , while some lawmakers jeered from the sidelines
to say that criticising your government is a criticism of a nation or a people is the coward 's way out mr orban
do n't try to deflect attention
if you make these laws then stand for them and we will debate them
orbans chief spokesman , zoltan kovacs , also panned the european union 's aim to stigmatize a whole nation merely because it dared to reject illegal migration and refused to become an immigrant country
the hungarian leader , an ultranationalist and anti-immigration zealot , has made no secret of his animosity toward the e.u.s liberal values
while his party , fidesz , is a member of the epp , the european parliament 's center-right bloc , orban has made common cause with europes far right
last week , he met with matteo salvini , italys deputy prime minister and a prominent far-right leader
the duo hailed their common front against migration and looked ahead to new european elections in may
some critics suggest that orbans anti-muslim fearmongering is a useful smokescreen to obscure the real effects of his rule a consolidation of power that looks a lot like creeping authoritarianism , which has also enabled widespread graft
however , a report on the rule of law and poor health of hungarys democracy is not the place to delve into such issues
rohac argued that effective pushback against authoritarianism , which is a problem in both hungary and poland , requires a truce over partisan lines on the highly contentious issues of immigration , culture , and values
i ask the members from the epp to follow their conscience
we are in an existential battle for the survival of the european project
orbn said in a press conference with salvini that he wants to destroy our union
for europes sake , we need to stop him futureofeurope eplenary
on tuesday , at least , it seemed that truce was in play
after various centrist and leftist factions in the european parliament indicated they would back the resolution against orban 's government , leading figures within orbans bloc said they would do the same
that included the party of right-wing austrian chancellor sebastian kurz , who warned that there are no compromises on the rule of law.
manfred weber , a german politician at the head of the epp and no cheerleader for immigration or multiculturalism panned orbans grandstanding against muslims
thats a stinging rebuke to orban , whose favorite role is that of the culture warrior , standing on the parapets of european christendom , howling at both the barbarians at the gates and the venal , liberal courtiers prancing behind its walls
he now finds himself isolated and somewhat chastened
fidesz may well feel compelled to quit the epp , though orban talked tough on tuesday and vowed we are staying and we are fighting.
even if his battle this week ends in defeat , theres a wider war that he and right-wing populists elsewhere are still all too eager to wage
