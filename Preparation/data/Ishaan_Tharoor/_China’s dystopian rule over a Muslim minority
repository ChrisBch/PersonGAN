beijing has long made it difficult to report in xinjiang , a far-flung region along its mountainous borders with pakistan and other countries in central asia
the foreign journalists who manage to make it there find themselves tracked by local security forces and burdened by the constant risk of endangering the sources they contact
but this past week , senior chinese officials were compelled to publicly account for what is taking place in xinjiang
a geneva-based panel of united nations human-rights experts issued a report alleging that as many as 2 million people may have been forced into a vast network of detention camps there
where chinese authorities were seeking to reeducate its muslim minorities
those are chiefly uighurs , a turkic muslim minority native to the region , but also ethnic kazakhs , kyrgyz and others
evidence of how china is forcing muslims into reeducation camps in xinjiang continues to emerge
said chinese delegate hu lianhe , according to the associated press
he added , there is no suppression of ethnic minorities or violations of their freedom of religious belief in the name of counterterrorism
but not even chinese officials can deny the scope of their efforts there , which it portrays as a response to a spate of terrorist violence and riots over the past decade
a few years ago , president xi jinping called for nets spread from earth to sky that is , a vast surveillance apparatus in the region
now , those living in the region cope with checkpoints and police informants , strict online censorship and constant government snooping
xinjiang may be on chinas geographical margins , but its at the heart of a lot of history
it was the crucible of turkic culture , the original homeland of languages and peoples that spread to the shores of the mediterranean
its dusty silk road caravan towns , ringed by desert and mountains , were for centuries literal crossroads of commerce and civilizations
but the region has rarely sat easily within the borders of china ( it was first seized by the qing dynasty in the 18th century )
cities like the historic oasis of kashgar once felt more culturally akin to kabul or baghdad to the west than beijing to the east
in recent years , though , china has gone to great lengths to subdue any trace of uighur separatism
it bulldozed large sections of old kashgar an architectural gem at the center of uighur identity and suppressed native languages spoken by uighurs , kazakhs and others in favor of chinese
the incarceration facilities in xinjiang are often called , like this one which is shown at an official opening , education and transformation centers ( )
rights groups have protested beijings increasingly draconian rule in xinjiang , which has grown alongside chinas 21st-century prowess in surveillance technologies
according to one estimate , though the region comprises just 2 percent of chinas population , it accounted for more than a fifth of all arrests carried out in the country last year
and the chinese dragnet now extends across borders , with officials threatening the relatives of uighurs living abroad and disappearing uighur academics who return from overseas
but while the deprivations of the uighurs and other minorities are comparable to those faced by the rohingya of myanmar , the plight of the former receives far less global attention
even as the citizens of dozens of majority-muslim countries clamor for the freedom of palestinians or kashmiris , significantly less noise is made about the situation in xinjiang
