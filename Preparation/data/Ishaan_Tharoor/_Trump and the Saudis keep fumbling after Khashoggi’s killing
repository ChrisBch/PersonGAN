on wednesday , nearly a month after journalist jamal khashoggi entered the saudi consulate in istanbul and vanished , turkish authorities made their strongest statement yet about what happened to the dissident writer
this conclusive declaration followed the departure from istanbul of saudi prosecutor saud al-mojeb , who had been dispatched to investigate khashoggis disappearance
despite the kingdoms vows of transparency and cooperation , mojeb , according to my colleagues , neither gave the location of khashoggis body to his turkish counterparts nor identified the supposed local collaborator who helped dispose of his remains
turkish investigators are reportedly pursuing a theory that khashoggis body was dissolved in acid
of khashoggis killing and that turkish officials doubted riyadh was keen on genuinely cooperating.

retweet to help us demand justice
for weeks , riyadh has engaged in a series of obfuscations , denials and delays as international anger mounted over khashoggis apparent death
eventually , the saudi government acknowledged that khashoggi had died in its custody
it blamed his killing on supposed rogue elements involved in a botched saudi operation to detain khashoggi and said they would be tried in saudi courts
but riyadh has yet to formally acknowledge the conclusions of the turkish investigation or publicly disclose its own
as readers of todays worldview know , the khashoggi scandal has badly damaged the reputation of saudi arabia and its ambitious crown prince , mohammed bin salman , a repeated target of criticism in khashoggis columns for the washington post
president trump has been a conspicuous cheerleader of mbs as the 33-year-old royal is often referred to but even he eventually spoke out against riyadhs handling of the matter
he nevertheless chose to defend mbs , who has reportedly struck up a close personal rapport with trumps son-in-law , jared kushner , and has been a vociferous supporter of trumps efforts to confront iran
he added that mbs is considered by far the strongest person and that he truly loves his country.
but while the white house may be keen to back its man in riyadh , the rest of washington is less enthusiastic
a number of prominent lobbying firms dropped their saudi contracts in reaction to khashoggis murder , and some foreign governments have trotted out tentative punishments
politicians in congress , including senators briefed by intelligence officials on the evidence collected by turkish authorities , have loudly denounced riyadh
on wednesday , a group of republican senators called on the white house to scrap talks over a u.s.-saudi civilian nuclear deal
lindsey graham mbs is a wrecking ball who had khashoggi murdered , he 's toxic and he 's got ta go
this guy is a wrecking ball , he had this guy murdered in a consulate in turkey , and to expect me to ignore it , i feel used and abused

other lawmakers in washington have trained their ire specifically on mbs , whose take-lots-of-prisoners rule is a departure from traditional saudi caution
yet the crisis over khashoggi has called mbss own position into question
as my colleagues reported in a lengthy expos , the crown prince reached his place of power within the court by ruthlessly sidelining , arresting or otherwise subduing rivals within the royal family , including some princes well known in washington circles
the pressure is now on his father , the aging king salman , to rein in his son
the question now is whether king salman will decide there is wisdom in curtailing mohammeds powers , or at least in appearing to do so , my colleagues wrote
reports of the return of one of the kings younger brothers , who had been living abroad out of fear of arrest , deepened speculation over the maneuvering taking place within the palace
one hypothetical scenario would see mbs compelled to share power with a more senior relative , who would work to restore international confidence in the kingdom
gregory gause , an expert on the kingdom at texas a & m university , said to huffpost
indeed , the administration which seemingly gave mbs carte blanche to wage a ruinous war in yemen , trigger a regional crisis by blockading qatar and allegedly detain the lebanese prime minister may be reaching its limits
this week , secretary of state mike pompeo and defense secretary jim mattis called for hostilities in yemen to end within 30 days
when saudi arabia was faced with international criticism over yemen in the past , the trump administration frequently rushed to riyadhs defense even after evidence showed that a saudi missile strike had killed dozens of yemeni schoolchildren
but after khashoggis murder , the mood is changing
