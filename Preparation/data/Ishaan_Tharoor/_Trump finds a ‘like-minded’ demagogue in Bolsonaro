as president trump banged the drum of ultranationalism on the campaign trail this week , you could be forgiven for missing a declaration from the white houses top foreign-policy official
white house national security adviser john bolton delivered a speech in southern florida on friday announcing new sanctions on leftist regimes in cuba and venezuela
he grouped the two countries together with nicaragua into a troika of tyranny , reprising the axis of evil he once decried as an official in the george w. bush administration
on one level , this could be boilerplate rhetoric from any hard-line republican administration
the specter of latin american leftism has long haunted washington in the forms of communist leaders such as fidel castro , marxist guerrillas such as the sandinistas or left-wing populists such as venezuelas hugo chvez and bolivias evo morales
on the other hand , the trump administration has been willing to act on its ideological caprices , ordering travel bans and unraveling major diplomatic agreements
in addition to the new sanctions , trump has also undone the brief obama-era thaw with cuba
but its not clear what the white house will achieve with its new , confrontational posture
had a very good conversation with the newly elected president of brazil , jair bolsonaro , who won his race by a substantial margin
we agreed that brazil and the united states will work closely together on trade , military and everything else
excellent call , wished him congrats
it was a strange way to describe a man who , as readers of todays worldview know , is notorious for his racist , homophobic and misogynist rhetoric and has cheered the brutal legacy of brazils military dictatorship
his chief economist , paolo guedes , champions the liberalizing reforms of the late chilean dictator augusto pinochet a man better known for the blood on his hands than his fiscal policy
none of this appears to be of much concern to trump
the u.s. president was one of the first major leaders to congratulate bolsonaro on his electoral victory on twitter , effusively cheering a fellow nationalist onto the hemispheric stage
( french president emmanuel macron , by contrast , offered a more guarded welcome to bolsonaro , stressing democratic principles and the importance of brazil holding the line on climate policy )
leftist sen. bernie sanders ( i-vt. ) wrote in a column two months ago
brazils new president jair bolsonaro is a far-right authoritarian who has praised the former military dictatorship and referred to black activists as animals.
it 's very troubling that bolton sees bolsonaro as like-minded with trump
even more troubling , hes probably right
in bolsonaro , trump may see an ideological fellow politician who shares his contempt for international agreements and organizations
bucking years of brazilian diplomacy , bolsonaro has announced that his government will move brazils embassy in israel to jerusalem and may shutter the palestinian mission in brasilia
following so closely in trumps footsteps deepens the sense of a new right-wing axis emerging in world politics , one within which the brazilian leader may play a prominent role
this may be good news for trump , particularly if he seeks to turn up the heat on venezuela bolsonaro has advocated a far tougher line against brazils dysfunctional northern neighbor than his more liberal opponents
but theres a risk of his rule drifting into the tyranny derided by bolton
