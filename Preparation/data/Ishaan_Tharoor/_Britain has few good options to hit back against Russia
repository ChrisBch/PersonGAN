britain believes that russia is behind the use of a russian nerve agent in the cathedral city of salisbury as part of an attempt to assassinate sergei skripal and his daughter , yulia
the attack left the pair comatose and in critical condition , while forcing 18 others to receive medical treatment
in addition to the expulsions , the largest of their kind in britain since 1985 , britain is imposing a host of other relatively minor penalties
moscow , which has a track record of striking at targets living in britain , denied any involvement in the episode , and senior russian officials ignored an ultimatum for an explanation of the incident
meanwhile , its media outlets and diplomatic corps voiced outrage and plenty of ridicule
as a range of kremlin mouthpieces decried mounting russophobia in the west and the russian embassy in london described the new punitive measures as totally unacceptable , unjustified and shortsighted , the russian foreign ministry mocked britain 's finger-pointing
sincere thanks to mrs may for highlylikelyrussiait 's gone to people and here is the first news for highlylikelyrussia
on russian television , a man wanted in the 2006 poisoning of a former kgb agent living in britain was casually brought on as a guest to discuss this week 's news
while theresa may was announcing the expulsion of 23 russian diplomats , providing reaction on russian tv was andrei lugovoi the man who , britain concluded , poisoned alexander litvinenko
the russians , may lamented to parliament , have treated the use of a military-grade nerve agent in europe with sarcasm , contempt and defiance
there are clear reasons why the russians seem to be taking the situation lightly
russian president vladimir putin is on the campaign trail less than a week from an almost-certain reelection , and would hardly want to strike a conciliatory tone against the foreign governments he loves to challenge
his politics are built on a defiant nationalism , drawing on both a desire to revive russia 's lost imperial glory as well as lingering resentment of the west
the trouble is that russia probably doesnt much worry about diplomatic expulsions , and british sanctions would add little to the broad range of western sanctions already in place over the annexation of crimea , a new york times editorial noted this week
yet if russias message is that no 'traitor is safe anywhere , it should be in the interest of every nation to send an indelible message to mr. putin that he can not deploy his weapons of war anywhere he wants
on wednesday , a session of the united nations security council offered tough rhetoric on russia but little meaningful action
there 's no consensus within the european union over new potential sanctions on russia , and the tortured negotiations over brexit has fundamentally impaired may 's ability to coordinate collective action
the episode underlines the extent to which uks post-brexit foreign and security relations with the eu remain unresolved , wrote patrick wintour , the guardian 's diplomatic editor
britain as a third party would not be automatically consulted on common foreign and security policy , including further sanctions coordination , but both sides have been deferring talks until the outline of a trade deal becomes clearer
further complicating the situation is the sheer weight of the russian presence in britain
for more than a decade , london has seen the ceaseless arrival of wealthy russian emigres , including oligarchs fleeing the kremlin and those still in putin 's good graces
with what some critics claim are looted assets , they have reshaped the british capital 's real estate market and social scene and led to a proliferation of spooks
russia now has more intelligence agents deployed in london than at the height of the cold war , ellen barry of the new york times reported
they serve a variety of functions , including building contacts among british politicians
its unclear whether may will consider any further action on pro-putin oligarchs living within britain , but she said that she believed the countrys money-laundering laws were strong enough to deal with corrupt elites
some prominent russian journalists saw that as mere avoidance
london is the de-facto capital of the post-soviet mafia state
it accumulates a lions share of oligarchic assets from everywhere in ex-ussr
but why tackle that , when you can pretend its another cold war
thats british governments reaction to skripal poisoning in a nutshell
in the end , of course , itll be ordinary russians who will suffer because punitive bureaucracy always goes for the lowest hanging fruit
why bother with corrupt officials when you can just arbitrarily reject student visa applications and break up families
putins most vocal opponent , anti-corruption activist alexei navalny , also expressed his concerns about the thrust of the western response
one scenario , as it seems to me , is putin 's comfortable scenario , he told abc news this week , gesturing at symbolic sanctions and the sort of expulsions ordered wednesday
there is a second option , he said , that would really be painful for putin and his corrupt circle that consists of applying targeted sanctions on those oligarchs and state officials whose families have been based for a very long time in great britain
those do not seem to be in the cards yet
meanwhile , even as his lieutenants criticized moscow , president trump was slow to denounce what could be a state-sponsored russian attack on the soil of one of his nation 's closest allies
the administration waited until wednesday evening to blame russia for the attack
trump often leaps to conclusions about islamist terrorist attacks before all the facts are known
his relative caution in this case is conspicuous to european observers and another indication of a larger , more troubling rift
trumps mixture of hostility and indifference to the european project , its trading power and its liberal , democratic values , is hardly news , wrote natalie nougayrde , the former editor of french daily le monde
but with the early signs of a trade war , and the growing evidence of the presidents disdain for britains predicament just when transatlantic empathy was expected , we see his estrangement from historical norms in sharp focus
