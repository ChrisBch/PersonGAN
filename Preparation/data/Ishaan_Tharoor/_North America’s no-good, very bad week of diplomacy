last week was not a great one in the annals of north american diplomacy
on tuesday , president trump and mexican president enrique pea nieto held a fraught phone call
their conversation inevitably circled around trump 's campaign pledge to force mexico to pay for a wall along the u.s. southern border , a demand considered deeply offensive by many mexicans
ahead of a planned trip to the white house , pea nieto was looking for assurances that trump would not use the occasion to grandstand on the wall
trump was reportedly unwilling to offer his mexican counterpart any such guarantees
speaking by phone on tuesday , pea nieto and trump devoted a considerable portion of their roughly 50 minute conversation to the wall , and neither man would compromise his position , wrote my colleagues , citing both u.s. and mexican diplomatic sources
one mexican official said trump 'lost his temper
but u.s. officials described him instead as being frustrated and exasperated , saying trump believed it was unreasonable for pea nieto to expect him to back off his crowd-pleasing campaign promise of forcing mexico to pay for the wall
in the wake of the testy exchange , pea nieto 's visit was called off
later that week , trump regaled a right-wing conference outside washington with promises to build the wall and crack down on immigration
on the other side of the world , canadian prime minister justin trudeau was enduring a different set of challenges
on an eight-day trip to india , trudeau 's usual charm campaign collapsed to sometimes hilarious effect
indians on social media mocked the trudeau family 's insistence on wearing overly formal indian attire to every occasion
indian prime minister narendra modi , meanwhile , trotted out a series of minor officials to deal with trudeau before finally meeting him on friday
is it just me or is this choreographed cuteness all just a bit much now
also fyi we indians dont dress like this every day sir , not even in bollywood
but there was genuine tension surrounding the trip
trudeau and his liberal party have an awkward association with elements of the sikh diaspora that supported the khalistan movement , a militant sikh separatist cause that sparked violence and terror attacks in the 1980s
pro-khalistan sentiments still exist among some in canada 's sikh community , which rankles many indians
the appearance of jaspal atwal , a sikh canadian extremist convicted for a 1986 assassination attempt on an indian official , at a mumbai reception in trudeau 's honor set off a media firestorm that canadian officials struggled to subdue
such mistakes overshadowed whatever positive message the canadian prime minister intended to convey to the world 's largest democracy
jaspal atwal was found guilty of attempted murder in 1986 after shooting a punjab state minister who was visiting vancouver island
atwal lives in canada , but travelled to india and attended a government function last night
here he is with sophie trudeau
that facade has crumbled.
the three north american leaders all have some work to do to repair their faltering reputations and agendas
in light of just how poorly this whole thing went , it might be a good time to consider whether trudeau has flown too close to the sun on the wings of his own celebrity star-power , suggested vice canada 's drew brown
even a good shtick gets old if thats all youve got , he added
meanwhile , trump is clinging even tighter to the routine that brought him to power , even if it makes diplomatic outreach with mexico all the more difficult
more than a year into his presidency , trump has neither received his mexican counterpart at the white house nor paid a visit to his southern neighbor
to be sure , pea nieto is a diminished president whose ruling party remains saddled with allegations of mismanagement and graft
trump 's talk of the wall exasperates the mexican public , but also focuses the spotlight on their president who critics say has been too weak in the face of u.s. bullying
mexicans will choose a new president in july , and andrs manuel lpez obrador , the leftist front-runner , made clear his intent to stand up to trump
if he insists on building the wall , were going to turn to the united nations to defend the rights of mexicans , lpez obrador said last week.
i 'm conscious of my historic responsibility
meanwhile , negotiations among the united states , mexico and canada over the north american free trade agreement resumed sunday
trump reviles nafta , as the tripartite pact is known , and wants to radically overhaul it
but several rounds of talks among the three countries have yielded little substantive progress , and early reports suggest it 's unlikely that this latest iteration will be any different
major stumbling blocks to the negotiations still remain , including u.s. demands to significantly change rules on automobile imports as well the imposition of a clause that could automatically kill nafta after five years
trudeau himself talked tough earlier this month , warning that canada is willing to walk away from nafta if the united states proposes a bad deal
... we are not going to take any old deal
at a time of tough optics and even tougher deliberations , there wo n't be an easy path for any of north america 's increasingly embattled leaders
