the week began with president trump lashing out after another rancorous trip to europe
but it ended with trumps deputy assuming a more poised role in asia
vice president pence spent the week touring the asia-pacific region , meeting with numerous leaders and dignitaries
after swinging through japan , pence went to singapore for the annual confab of the association of southeast nations ( asean )
that included an awkward meeting with myanmars de facto leader , aung san suu kyi , during which pence pressed suu kyi on her governments role in last years massacres of rohingya muslims and the imprisonment of two reuters journalists who covered them
pence now heads to the asia-pacific economic cooperation summit this weekend in port moresby , the capital of papua new guinea
hell be joined by canadian prime minister justin trudeau , chinese president xi jinping and other statesmen from around the pacific rim
conspicuously absent here is trump
he declined the opportunity to make the trip , a move some analysts saw as a worrying sign for washingtons asian agenda
russian president vladimir putin made a first-ever state visit to singapore this week in a bid to boost moscows clout in the region
starting in 2011 , trumps predecessor , barack obama , made a habit of attending asean meetings he missed only one , in 2013 , when washington was in the middle of a government shutdown
trump who , according to one account , has retreated into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment over the mueller investigation and his partys midterm election losses chose to buck the trend
thats not likely to go down well across the pacific
honored to address the 6th us-asean summit
our most cherished principles accountable & responsive government , the rule of law & individual rights - are bulwarks of sovereignty & building blocks of progress
we support their spread across the wider indo-pacific vpinasia asean
but perhaps , given trumps recent overseas performances , his no-show isnt such a bad thing
according to my colleagues , trump was infuriated by french president emmanuel macrons rebuke of his nationalist politics as the two leaders shared a stage in paris over the weekend
the angry tweets he later aimed at macron prompted a french government official to accuse the american president of lacking common decency.
presidential historian douglas brinkley said to the post
but pence cuts a more circumspect figure , even while hes enacting trumps agenda
in tokyo , he offered standard washington talking points.
authoritarianism and aggression have no place in the indo-pacific
and i know this vision is shared by the united states and japan
in an interview with the posts josh rogin , pence talked tough on china and said that beijing must significantly change its behavior on multiple fronts
the looming trade war between the worlds two largest economies probably will dominate headlines ahead of the group of 20 summit in buenos aires at the end of this month , when trump and xi are expected to meet
in port moresby , pence is expected to deliver a speech signaling new american efforts to rival chinas ambitious belt and road initiative , which has seen beijing pour billions of dollars into infrastructure projects around the world
it has also led to allegations of graft by local officials and provoked accusations that china is simply a new kind of neocolonial power , locking other developing nations into cycles of debt
a u.s. official told reporters in asia that pences plan will be a private-sector-driven mode rather than the dangerous debt diplomacy china has been engaging in the region.
like an ocean , the chinese economy has been nurturing and benefiting smaller economies such as papua new guinea , said an apec coordination official xiplomacy
many countries in southeast asia , accustomed to balancing great-power rivalries , will welcome american efforts
but for all of pences bravado , the trump administration still has plenty of doubters in the region
if so we are not comfortable.
its also unlikely china will make many or any of the concessions pence demanded
an offer beijing put forward on thursday to kick-start moribund trade talks looks unlikely to break the current impasse , according to reports
