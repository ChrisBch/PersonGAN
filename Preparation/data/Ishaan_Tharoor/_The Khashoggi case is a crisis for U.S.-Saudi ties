this could be the moment that saudi arabia finally loses washington
over the weekend , turkish officials told my colleagues that veteran saudi journalist jamal khashoggi , who vanished after entering the saudi consulate in istanbul last week , was murdered by a 15-member saudi team dispatched to kill him
according to a u.s. official briefed by turkish counterparts , khashoggis body was likely dismembered , removed in boxes and flown out of the country
the grisly claims sent a jolt through the u.s. capital , which is traditionally friendly territory for riyadh
khashoggi , 59 , had recently moved to the united states in self-imposed exile
he wrote columns for the washington posts opinions section and counted many american intellectuals and journalists among his friends
if his killing is confirmed , it could prompt a decisive change in how the united states deals with saudi arabia
leading republican and democratic lawmakers issued notes of alarm over the reports of khashoggis death and threatened repercussions if they are true
i pray saudi journalist jamal khashoggi is alive
but if this deeply disturbing news report is confirmed , the united states & the civilized world must respond strongly , and i will review all options in senate
if this is true - that the saudis lured a u.s. resident into their consulate and murdered him - it should represent a fundamental break in our relationship with saudi arabia
saudi authorities have vehemently denied the claims as baseless allegations and said a team of saudi investigators had arrived in istanbul to assist the turkish inquiry into khashoggis disappearance
saudi officials in istanbul took a team of journalists inside the consulate in a bid to prove their innocence
meanwhile , reports in saudi media attempted to discredit the accounts of khashoggis fiancee , who first reported that he was missing on tuesday
no turkish official has yet publicly confirmed that khashoggi is dead
in remarks made sunday , president recep tayyip erdogan said only that the mystery was very , very upsetting and he was chasing the matter
but many turkish officials seemed confident in the assessment that the saudis carried out murder.
there is concrete information it will not remain an unsolved case , said yasin aktay , an adviser to erdogans justice and development party , in a sunday interview with cnn turk
at the time of writing , the trump administration had not responded to the allegations
secretary of state mike pompeo , as well as state department spokeswoman heather nauert , spent the weekend on a mission to the korean peninsula
president trump issued no tweets on khashoggi
thats not surprising while trump and his lieutenants routinely point to the malign actions of iran in the middle east , they have both enabled and ignored abuses carried out by the saudis
since becoming the heir to the throne last year , crown prince mohammed bin salman , or mbs , has touted his reform plans , promising to liberalize his country and earning plaudits from a host of american commentators
but mbss de facto reign has also seen him terrorize rivals and arrest numerous feminists and civil-society activists , including some who now face the death penalty
analysts argue its part of mbss need to further consolidate power
trump is not bothered by monarchical excesses in riyadh
on a visit there in 2017 , trump celebrated the saudis as stalwart friends who would partner with the white house in its bid to confront iran
he has also repeatedly hailed the saudis willingness to lavish tens of billions of dollars on american military hardware
but in congress , there is growing disquiet over the apparent carte blanche the white house has given the saudis , particularly as the united states continues to back the bloody saudi-led intervention in yemen , which has seen mounting civilian casualties
if khashoggis alleged murder is confirmed , that political scrutiny will only deepen
and while the american public may not be bothered by the disappearance of an outspoken saudi journalist , khashoggis case is likely to shadow all discussions of u.s.-saudi ties in washington
american commentators who conducted lengthy interviews with the crown prince as part of riyadhs pr push earlier this year have already sounded off , demanding action
president trump must ask saudis to give full and credible account of what happened to jamal khashoggi inside their istanbul consulate
and tell us what he knows too
if my friend jamal khashoggis death is confirmed , it is a monstrous outrage
those responsible will pay a severe price
we loved jamals honesty we wont forgive those who tried to silence him
the brazenness of khashoggis apparent assassination sends a chilling message to other arab dissidents in the middle east
though turkey has its own atrocious record of detaining journalists , istanbul has become a sanctuary for exiled opponents of regimes across the region
the disappearance of khashoggi who , in his columns for the post , was a thoughtful , constructive critic of the saudi leadership suggests that other critics may not be as comfortable as they think
