were entering the run-up to perhaps the most important election in the western hemisphere this year
next month , brazilians will elect new governors and legislatures in each of the countrys 27 states all 513 members of the lower house of congress some two-thirds of the senate and , most importantly , a new president
the first round of the presidential election will be held on oct. 7
for now , theres only one politician who most expect to qualify for the two-candidate runoff on oct. 28 63-year-old jair bolsonaro , a far-right nationalist whose ascent echoes the rise of right-wing populists across the west , including that of president trump
brazil has been wracked by years of tumult a vast corruption scandal has caused presidential impeachments and rolling political feuds
economic havoc has led to a recession and millions of brazilians are backsliding into poverty
meanwhile , crime rates have soared
despite the mounting public anger and waves of mass protests that have hit the countrys major cities , little has fundamentally changed
while some establishment politicians are now in jail , dozens of others implicated in allegations of graft may win reelection to their seats in congress
a poll last year found that only 13 percent of brazilians were satisfied with their democracy
that backdrop has given bolsonaro , a former army captain who eked out most of his career on the fringes of politics , his moment to shine
like trump , bolsonaro has marshaled widespread disaffection to build a viral , anti-establishment movement
he , too , promises sweeping , bludgeoning reform including the privatization of major state-owned companies while pandering to a socially conservative base of voters , particularly an increasingly influential bloc of evangelical christians
his campaign has , at least informally , sought the counsel of former trump adviser stephen k. bannon
and bolsonaro himself has welcomed comparisons to the u.s. president , whom he hails for challenging political correctness and the rotten media elite
bolsonaros supporters see him as a messiah who will make brazil great again
others are not so convinced
a new cover story in the economist branded the populist front-runner as latin americas latest menace
brazil is in desperate need of reform , but jair bolsonaro would make a disastrous president
our cover this week
two weeks ago , bolsonaro survived a near-fatal stabbing attack while on the campaign trail
the ordeal added to his sense of epochal purpose
whats at stake
its not my future , said the wounded candidate , speaking from his so paolo hospital bed
we live in a time when the future of more than 200 million brazilians is at stake
meanwhile , bolsonaros critics and there are many point to the rather unseemly side of his politics
he also talked about the weight of those slave descendants using a measure that brazilian farmers apply to animals
bolsonaro does still have to go to court over accusations of slander and incitement to rape , dating back to a 2014 incident when he attacked a left-leaning congresswoman , saying he would not rape her because she was ugly and didnt deserve it
hes also well-known for his disparagement of lgbt brazilians bolsonaro has said he would prefer a dead son to a gay one and has likened the right of gay couples to adopt to pedophilia
he has attacked immigrants as scum and has proposed selling off the lands of indigenous brazilians
unsurprisingly , bolsonaros backers have framed his grossly offensive rhetoric as plain-speaking banter meant to cut through the platitudes of the corrupt and out-of-touch political class
agradeo a todos que esto demonstrando apoio das mais variadas formas
surpreendente a fora que isso nos d para seguir em frente ( com carlosbolsonaro )
arrayed against bolsonaro is a cast of centrist and center-left challengers
one potential opponent in the second round is fernando haddad , a former mayor of sao paolo and a key figure within the left-leaning workers party
haddad was tapped to run by popular former president luiz incio lula da silva , who languishes behind bars on a corruption conviction his supporters insist is politically motivated
a bolsonaro vs. haddad showdown raises the prospect of a bitter left vs. right clash
to the alarm of his opponents , bolsonaro has spoken admiringly of brazils brutal military dictatorship , which ruled for multiple decades and disappeared and tortured countless leftist dissidents
his running mate , retired army general hamilton mouro , has even floated the idea of a coup against the judiciary and rewriting brazils constitution to constrain civil liberties
bolsonaro represents a new brand of populism in latin america , one that returns to its fascist origins across the world , wrote federico finchelstein , a historian at the new school
bolsonaros rise should serve as a reminder that we are experiencing a worldwide crisis of democracy , one not limited to trumpism or the rise of the extreme right in europe
if brazil falls , if brazil goes authoritarian , i would worry a lot about the rest of the region , harvard political scientist steven levitsky said to huffpost
people in latin america militaries in latin america , demagogues and democrats in latin america will be paying close attention to brazil
it would have devastating regional consequences
like far-right leaders in europe , bolsonaro could still stumble at the final hurdle , with a critical mass uniting against him in the second round
the outsider option seems particularly attractive to many citizens
in brazil , the outsider candidate will probably make it to the second round , noted felipe krause and andre borges in the posts monkey cage blog , before pointing to centrist french leaders who beat back far-right challenges
but the nations constraints on extremists suggest whoever else reaches that round will be brazils jacques chirac or emmanuel macron
still , in an era of virulent nationalist rage , it would be naive to count bolsonaro out
