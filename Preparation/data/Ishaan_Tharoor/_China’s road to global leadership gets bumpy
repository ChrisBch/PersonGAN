on sunday , an annual meeting of pacific rim countries ended with a clash between two behemoths
the asia pacific economic cooperation summit , held in port moresby , papua new guinea , saw chinese and american representatives continue their countries battles over trade
for the first time in the blocs history , there was no joint communique issued at the summits end
the impasse echoed the rancor at the group of seven summit in quebec this summer , where a spat with canadian prime minister justin trudeau prompted president trump to reject a joint statement agreed to by key u.s. allies
but this time , it wasnt the white house that was blamed for the breakdown
citing an official from the american delegation , the wall street journal reported china balked at a single proposed sentence in the communique we agreed to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices.
beijing has refused to acknowledge one of washingtons main grievances its alleged coercing of u.s. companies to transfer technology to chinese counterparts and believed the proposed wording was too direct a jab at china
the xi show by the sea shore
hundreds of red flags , china aid signs and even a purpose-built pagoda driving around the papua new guinea capital , you could be forgiven for thinking the chinese president is hosting this week 's apec
noted the journal.
other apec members favored including the language in the final communiqu , the official said
officials at the meeting from several nations said the fight wasnt only between the u.s. and china
other apec members also lined up against beijing
papua new guinea prime minister peter oneill said to reporters
the journal reported , citing two senior officials from the host country
chinese officials denied the report , but they couldnt dispel the dark clouds looming over the proceedings
for president xi jinping , the apec summit was supposed to highlight chinas friendly face to the world
instead , he faced off against vice president pence , who used the forum to decry chinas global development projects as opaque schemes that saddle weaker countries with staggering debt.
the united states launched a rival infrastructure initiative , backed by australia , new zealand and japan
the showdown illustrated a deepening political reality in asia many countries are far more wary of an increasingly assertive china than the united states , the old guarantor of security in the pacific
every nation gathered here at apec has a place in potus vision for a free and open indo-pacific
our vision excludes no one
we only ask that nations respect their neighbors sovereignty , embrace free , fair , and reciprocal trade , and uphold individual rights
that said , washington cant rest on its laurels
many governments in asia are as perturbed by trumps penchant for protectionism as they are by chinas growing clout on the world stage
beijing , for example , has made significant overtures to japan , hoping to mend fences and capitalize on trumps unpopularity
to both a rising china and the waning pax americana
xi may not be quite as prepared for that game as it may seem
in a rare and provocative riposte to the countrys central leadership , beijings former chief trade negotiator recently commented that china wasnt thinking deeply enough during its current confrontation with washington
