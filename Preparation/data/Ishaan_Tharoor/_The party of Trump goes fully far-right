in the run-up to tuesdays midterms , rep. steve king ( r-iowa ) faced mounting condemnation over his openly white-supremacist politics
king has a long record of demonizing minorities , fulminating over the decline of white civilization and courting extremists who peddle racist conspiracy theories about the replacement of white europeans by nonwhite immigrants
there are many republicans who would bristle at kings contention , but they are a waning force
president trump has been the catalyst of a dramatic realignment or a repolarization of politics , as my colleagues michael scherer and josh dawsey put it that branded the gop as the faction of white nationalist rage
salvini trump sconfitto alle elezioni di midterm
ha mantenuto la maggioranza al senato , gli stati uniti crescono al 4 % , la disoccupazione ai minimi
averne battute di arresto come lui ... ottoemezzo
the reaction to the midterms in europe reflected the continents own divisions
frans timmermans , the european commissions first vice president , saw the democrats taking control of the house of representatives as encouragement for europes own liberal establishment , which is preparing for a far-right assault in next years elections for the european union parliament
timmermans wrote in a twitter post.
they stood up for their values
and so will we.
but italian far-right leader matteo salvini hailed the senate gains made by republicans , who picked off a number of vulnerable democrats in trump-friendly states
said salvini , nursing the grievance and resentment that fuels far-right politics on both sides of the atlantic
trump pushed the same fearful message about immigration that has defined his agenda since he ran for president
he shirked the counsel of hill insiders and establishment republican politicians , including outgoing speaker of the house paul d. ryan ( wis. ) , that he focus on the strong economy and other positive stories
the president became upset when his campaign produced an ad that focused on economic gains through the eyes of a mother hoping her daughter would succeed , surprising his own political advisers , reported the washington posts scherer and dawsey
trump , they wrote , wanted to talk immigration.
he conjured a fictional migrant invasion out of reports that a bedraggled caravan of asylum seekers was slowly making its way toward the united states
he ostentatiously deployed active-duty troops to the u.s.-mexico border and attacked democrats and immigrants with a tv ad so nakedly racist that even fox news pulled it from the airwaves
on wednesday , trump showed no contrition for the toxic effect of his rhetoric , which critics say fueled a spate of recent right-wing terrorist attacks
indeed , he took credit for republican victories and mocked republicans who lost their elections because they refused his embrace.
white house aides also cheered trumps ability to mobilize votes in largely white areas , which helped fuel the gains in the senate and high-profile wins in the ohio and florida governors races
those that worked with me in this incredible midterm election , embracing certain policies and principles , did very well
those that did not , say goodbye
yesterday was such a very big win , and all under the pressure of a nasty and hostile media
for trump , as for europes far right , the game is polarization a galvanized minority of voters is preferable to an apathetic majority
but unlike in europe , where parliamentary politics usually keep the far right out of government , the nature of the u.s. political system means that a far-right gop can still wield huge amounts of power
and with trump having staved off the worst of the democratic wave in 2018 using racial animus , there are justifiable fears that the president and his allies will turn even more extreme in 2020
so we may hear more of the racist robo-calls that florida voters received mocking andrew gillum , the black democratic candidate for governor
there may be more candidates like trump-endorsed ron desantis , gillums victorious opponent , who warned voters not to monkey this up by voting for gillum
there could be another wave of anti-semitic campaign ads featuring jewish candidates clutching bunches of cash
and there will certainly be more attempts to tighten voting laws in ways that hurt minority groups more than anyone else
but that presidential platform does matter
trump has taken the culture-war tactics of europes far right into the american mainstream , something republican leaders in recent decades might only furtively have attempted
and trump may be no aberration
