before a friendly audience of more than 18,000 people in washington on tuesday , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu delivered an all-too-familiar speech
he bashed iran , a rogue actor bringing darkness ... on our region.
he extolled the tremendous advances of israeli science and technology
and he lauded the cherished alliance between his country and the united states , particularly the close friendship that he shares with president trump
netanyahu concluded , to rapturous applause
there are few places beyond the annual conference of the american israel public affairs committee , the influential washington lobbying group , where netanyahu is more in his element
he received a hero 's welcome and offered a father figure 's oration
we love you , bibi , a woman in the crowd shouted at one point
that 's very kind of you , he said.
i love you , too.
wrote david horovitz , the founding editor of the times of israel , referring to the thousands in attendance
when that is the demand , there 's no better seller than netanyahu
thank you , aipac
the problem for the israeli leader is that there is a world beyond aipac
later this week , he will go home , where the situation is far less agreeable
there netanyahu faces the possibility of being indicted on charges of corruption and bribery
while he was abroad , news broke that a third former aide has agreed to cooperate with the police and turn over recordings of the prime minister and his wife
while his allies believe he may withstand the legal trouble , his critics are certainly hoping this was the last time he addresses aipac as the head of israel 's government
if it was , trump will not be happy
he gave netanyahu a warm reception at the white house , perhaps empathizing with his counterpart 's plight
like trump , netanyahu has been quick to identify witch hunts against him and inveigh against supposed enemies in the media and state bureaucracy
netanyahu 's cuddly relationship with trump shone through in the latter 's decision last year to unilaterally recognize jerusalem as israel 's undivided capital
the move infuriated palestinians as well as much of the international community , while sending the moribund peace process further into its death spiral
but despite all evidence to the contrary , trump declared that peace is in sight
the contours of trump 's long-mooted plan remain utterly indistinct even senior israeli officials admitted to not knowing much about it
all signs point to an active disinterest in the two-state solution from both netanyahu and the trump administration
this may not be a problem for netanyahu domestically , where the israeli electorate has moved rightward and has few qualms with the status quo
but it 's harmful in the long run to american jewish support for israel
this year , the pew research center published a new poll that showed partisan splits between republicans and democrats over israel as well as netanyahu himself at their highest level in nearly four decades
that is certainly exacerbated by the israeli leader 's enthusiastic support for trump , a profoundly polarizing figure in the united states
but there are other issues at work , including ultra-orthodox resistance to public pluralism in israel and netanyahu 's widely decried plan to deport thousands of african asylum seekers
above all there 's the matter of what to do about the ongoing military occupation of the palestinian territories
at a meeting on the sidelines of the aipac conference , influential ministers in netanyahu 's cabinet made it clear they have no interest in an independent palestinian state and they expect their interlocutors in the west to eventually live with that reality
the partisan divide in middle east sympathies , for israel or the palestinians , is now wider than at any point since 1978
