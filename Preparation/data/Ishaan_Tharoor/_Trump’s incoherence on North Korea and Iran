at the end of his visit to the united states last week , french president emmanuel macron offered a bit of candor
despite his entreaties , macron suspected that president trump would choose to eventually pull out of the nuclear deal with iran
the move , said the french president , would have little to do with middle east geopolitics
macron told reporters , while cautioning that jettisoning the agreement would be insane in the medium to long-term.
macron 's conclusion that trump is mostly driven to fulfill his campaign promises ( and systematically unravel the legacy of his predecessor ) is hardly a novel insight
but it 's still apt , especially as trump champions the cause of diplomacy with north korea while decrying diplomatic efforts toward iran
korean war to end
the united states , and all of its great people , should be very proud of what is now taking place in korea
trump hails his administration 's campaign of maximum pressure on north korea , which he claims formed the backdrop to friday 's historic meeting between north korean despot kim jong un and south korean president moon jae-in
the summit , which took place on the south korean side of the dmz , has led to positive noises about the denuclearization of the peninsula and optimism about trump 's own planned meeting with kim
but if trump 's stated agenda with north korea comes to fruition , it may not look that different from the nuclear pact he seems intent on scrapping
the deal forged between iran and a group of world powers in 2015 followed not just months of concerted negotiations , but years of wider diplomacy to squeeze tehran and bring it to the table
even though the pact has effectively curbed tehran 's nuclear program , its critics in the trump administration say it granted iran economic relief while doing nothing to curtail its wider role in the middle east 's various conflicts
yet , at the same time , the white house is possibly creating a scenario in which kim can win similar concessions for north korea without doing much to reform his tyrannical rule
there 's a fair dose of speculation now on what may follow with the north koreans
pyongyang made a few goodwill gestures over the weekend , including a promise to dismantle its key nuclear-test site
but a host of analysts remain skeptical of the potential for a genuine breakthrough
there have been other false dawns with north korea in recent history , they point out , and there 's still a wide gulf in how both sides envision denuclearization taking place
just had a long and very good talk with president moon of south korea
things are going very well , time and location of meeting with north korea is being set
also spoke to prime minister abe of japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations
still , it 's curious that while the united states is now preparing to extend an olive branch to the north koreans , it has placed itself on a collision course with tehran
iran may be a human-rights abuser at home and a destabilizing presence in the middle east , but it is more open and tethered to the international system than the totalitarian , pariah regime in pyongyang
and unlike north korea , it has submitted to thorough international inspections and does n't actually possess nuclear weapons
trump himself has shown little ideological consistency here long before he was president , he told cnn in 2011 that talks with the iranian leadership would be preferable to killing millions of people.
the iran nuclear deal is a terrible one for the united states and the world
it does nothing but make iran rich and will lead to catastrophe
perhaps the trump administration wants this atmosphere of confrontation
both pompeo and trump 's national security adviser , john bolton , have called for regime change in iran
neither are placing much faith in a nuclear deal with north korea
on sunday , bolton said the administration was pursuing the libya model with pyongyang , referring to a process started in 2003 that pressured then-libyan dictator moammar gaddafi to give up his nuclear , chemical and long-range missile program
it was a curious analogy , given that the north koreans point to gaddafi 's death at the hands of a nato-backed rebellion as justification for maintaining their own nuclear arsenal
wrote arms control expert jeffrey lewis
that may allow trump another potshot at barack obama , the president who was ever wary of aggressive solutions.
but critics are right to be worrying about its profound risks
