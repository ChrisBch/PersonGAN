this week , the leaders of the two koreas made progress toward rapprochement , concluding a dramatic summit in pyongyang
though president trump was not in attendance , he sought to take credit for the latest diplomatic gains
in remarks to reporters wednesday morning , the president suggested that , before his arrival on the political scene , war on the korean peninsula was inevitable.
by the afternoon , secretary of state mike pompeo indicated that the united states was ready to immediately restart direct talks with north korea over its nuclear program
kim jong un has agreed to allow nuclear inspections , subject to final negotiations , and to permanently dismantle a test site and launch pad in the presence of international experts
in the meantime there will be no rocket or nuclear testing
hero remains to continue being ... ... ..
... .returned home to the united states
also , north and south korea will file a joint bid to host the 2032 olympics
the mood seems a world apart from the tensions of a year ago , when trump and north korean leader kim jong un rattled sabers at each other amid missile tests , atomic explosions and the conspicuous deployments of aircraft carriers
trump threatened north korea with fire and fury and mobilized an international campaign of maximum pressure , including stringent new sanctions
trump has repeatedly insisted that the maximum pressure campaign compelled kim to come to the table and paved the way for a potentially historic peace
but skeptics point to the dizzying , confused trajectory of white house strategy which alternated threats and flattery , and insists on a complete denuclearization few have faith will ever come to pass as a sign of an administration without a real plan
now , trump appears to be losing what leverage he had
on wednesday , kim and south korean president moon jae-in stood side-by-side , hailing their hope for an era of peace and prosperity on the peninsula
the latest round of diplomacy between the two countries had been spurred by moons desire to keep the momentum going following the airy agreements made in singapore
wrote richard sokolsky , a nonresident fellow of the carnegie endowment for international peace
the next big step may include a visit by kim to seoul , another historic first
but the specter of kims nuclear arsenal will still hover over proceedings
noted jung pak of the brookings institution
the scholarly consensus is that kim has little intention of wholly surrendering the stockpile of weapons that brought him face-to-face with the leader of the worlds sole superpower in singapore
many analysts also point to previous false dawns with pyongyang , warning that even its current concessions hardly set it on the path to giving up its weapons
can we step back and appreciate ( or lament )
that the six-party talks joint statement , in which nk committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs was issued exactly 13 years ago today , as we parse these meager morsels from kju
said melissa hanham , a senior research associate at the middlebury institute of international studies at monterey , to my colleagues
mit arms control researcher vipin narang told npr , referring to the politicking over the tongchang-ri facility
whats unique about this moment , argue some experts , is trumps personal zeal to score a geopolitical win
kim has shifted focus to talks about economic engagement and nonnuclear matters , even as pyongyang shirks committing to a clear timeline over denuclearization or accepting proper verification of its nuclear capabilities
this suits moon , for whom diplomacy with north korea is about much more than nuclear weapons
trump , too , seems happy to go down the current path
said harry kazianis , of the center for the national interest , to the south china morning post
i think we can say the maximum pressure is over.
