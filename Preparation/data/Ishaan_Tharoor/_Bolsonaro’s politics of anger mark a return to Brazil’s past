the new leader of latin americas biggest democracy and economy doesnt care about your feelings
that is , unless you share his rage at leftists , apparent scorn for women , homosexuals and vulnerable minorities , and zeal for blowing up his countrys sclerotic status quo
on sunday , 63-year-old jair bolsonaro won the second round in brazils presidential election at a canter , coming comfortably ahead of his leftist challenger , fernando haddad
his victory capped a bewildering ascent for more than two decades , the former army captain existed on the political fringes as a congressman in brasilia , a figure of buffoonery and contrived controversy , the butt of jokes
now , buoyed by a decisive electoral mandate and significant parliamentary support , he may be poised to radically reshape brazil and its democratic institutions
from afar , bolsonaros success can be seen as the latest and perhaps most emphatic victory of right-wing populism in the west
he and his allies consciously linked their campaign to president trump and maintained regular contact with former trump adviser stephen k. bannon
they harped on the supposed threat posed by the cultural marxism of their opponents , vowed a ruthless war on crime , promised to drain the swamp of a corrupt establishment , and wrapped themselves in the flag of the nation
had a very good conversation with the newly elected president of brazil , jair bolsonaro , who won his race by a substantial margin
we agreed that brazil and the united states will work closely together on trade , military and everything else
excellent call , wished him congrats
voters opted for bolsonaros hard-line pitch in reaction to the countrys faltering economy , soaring crime rates and mounting frustration with a political class exposed by a mammoth corruption scandal
though a seven-term lawmaker in brasilia , bolsonaro successfully spun himself as a maverick outsider on a mission to revamp the nation
a new generation of lawmakers that includes voluble youtube celebrities will join bolsonaro in brasilia
the president-elect is reported to have benefited from widespread misinformation campaigns that spread through social media platforms such as whatsapp and facebook
looking beyond the past three decades of democratic consolidation , bolsonaro harks back to the dark period of brazils military dictatorship which held sway between 1964 and 1985 , a not-too-distant episode in the countrys history and sees inspiration
when he cast a vote in 2016 to impeach the leftist president dilma rousseff , he did so in the name of the military commander who had presided over her torture in 1970
he and his allies have cheered the juntas grisly program that saw countless leftist activists disappeared , brutalized , raped and murdered
but bolsonaro is set to let loose a stridently ideological agenda one that could have a major impact on brazil , the region and the world
he is bent on reversing or canceling protections that brazils democracy had afforded to indigenous peoples and other disadvantaged minorities
pandering to evangelical voters , he could reshape the school curriculum in favor of traditional values , while curbing teachers ability to express political views
the man predicted to be his education minister is a retired general who has defended the militarys right to intervene in politics
backed by powerful agribusiness interests , he wants to roll back environmental laws that thwart logging and the expansion of farms in the amazon basin
he also seeks to vanquish influential leftist workers movements that support landless farmers and the homeless in big cities
the markets have warmed to his privatization plans environmentalists , though , warn that his proposed unraveling of brazils climate policies would be a disaster for the planet
my colleagues reported
surely booth countries will work together and we will also change the culture that try to keep brazil away from us approaching us to the bolivarians , marxists and gramsciists
this public congratulation from the us is a sign of new times , times of prosperity , unity and meritocracy
more broadly , theres still confidence that brazils institutions and civil society can withstand bolsonaros demagogic influence , and that the military , a neutral entity removed from politics , will remain so
but bolsonaros victory has brought to the surface painful hatreds and divisions , especially those of class and race
when the newly elected governor of rio de janeiro , who campaigned with bolsonaros son , was asked what he would do with all the suspected criminals from the favelas arrested on his watch , he quipped monday that he would dig more graves.
wrote brazilian columnist marcelo paiva , whose mother and teenage sister were detained by the military dictatorship and whose father , a socialist politician , was disappeared and killed
bolsonaro could make them remember
