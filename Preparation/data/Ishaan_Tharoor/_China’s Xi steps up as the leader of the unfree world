on sunday , the chinese communist party made an unexpected announcement the party will propose scrapping the line in china 's constitution that limits presidents to no more than two consecutive terms.
that means president xi jinping , who just started his second five-year term , probably will rule well beyond 2023
when xi came to power half a decade ago , some commentators in the west imagined him leading his nation down the road of economic and political change
instead , as we 've discussed before , xi ushered in a stiffening authoritarianism , purging thousands of political opponents , squeezing the already narrow space for civil society and presiding over the creation of a cutting-edge 21st- century surveillance state
the latest news only confirms his desire to bring china firmly under his grasp
my colleague emily rauhala noted
jerome cohen , a noted chinese legal expert at new york university , wrote in a blog post
find the thing you love and stick with it
cute , creative and devastatingly clever criticism of xi jumping and his government 's move to eliminate presidential term limits in china
the signs of a deepening dictatorship under xi have been present for quite some time
human rights activists have been jailed , internal party debate subdued and censorship ratcheted up including against memes on social media that mocked xi 's budding imperial rule
in recent years , beijing has also taken dramatic steps to rein in the special administrative region of hong kong
once considered an incubator of liberal values that could help spread democracy and liberalism to the chinese mainland , the former british colony is now increasingly at risk of losing its cherished freedoms
in the near term , xi may have little to fear when it comes to internal challenges
but chinas economic growth is slackening , and some critics point to looming structural crises on the horizon that could further shock the system and possibly give momentum to potential rivals among the various cliques and power centers within china 's high leadership
xis move should also be seen in a broader global context
for years , chinese officials and state media have rolled their eyes at western lectures about china 's undemocratic political system
they pointed to the dysfunction gripping democracies elsewhere , contrasting it to the economic and diplomatic successes achieved under one-party rule
and now , they are casting xi 's tightening grip as the right system for an uncertain geopolitical moment
the value system floated here is n't wholly unique to china
xi propagates a muscular brand of chinese nationalism , steeped in appeals to a rosy imperial past and visions of a triumphant future not unlike other illiberal autocrats elsewhere
speaking to denyer , willy lam , a professor at the chinese university of hong kong , invoked russian president vladimir putin , who has also challenged the western-led status quo while playing the part of the indispensable father of his nation
if xi is issuing a new challenge , it has yet to provoke much of a response
michael a. mcfaul , a political scientist and former u.s. ambassador to moscow , told the new york times.
nobody is making that argument today.
