speaking to the washington post last week , a senior administration official offered a concise version of president trump 's ideal national-security strategy
trump 's dream would be to have a strong military that protects our homeland , the official told my colleague greg jaffe
wed wall ourselves off and strike at our discretion and then retreat to defending our homeland
trump is no isolationist instead , he often invokes an image of a muscular america bending opponents to its will around the world
but he is singularly disinterested in shouldering the burdens that come with being a global hegemon
the white house is pursuing cuts to the state department and international aid programs
it has downplayed rhetoric surrounding human rights , democracy and the rule of law
and even as it expresses concerns for the humanitarian suffering of the syrian people , the trump administration has gone out of its way to stigmatize and punish syrian refugees
according to new state department figures , the united states has only admitted 44 syrian refugees since last october
it resettled only 3,024 in all of 2017 , far below the 45,000 annual cap on syrian refugees now set by the state department
in 2016 , the last year of the obama presidency , 15,479 syrian refugees were resettled in the united states a figure that a whole swathe of activists and ngos believed was insufficient
now that seems like a golden age
the trump administration has cast syrian refugees as threats to national security and stemmed the flow in the name of extreme vetting
yet , as a new number-crunching analysis by the libertarian cato institute shows , the risk posed by vetted refugees in the united states is tiny
since 9/11 , the annual risk of death from a vetting failure was 1 in 328 million annually , noted a cato statement
for comparison , americans faced a 1 in 20,000 chance of dying in a non-terrorist homicide during the same period
syria headlines this week 1 ) a functional end to acceptance of syrian refugees 2 ) more air strikes.if trump really cared about the syrian people , america would n't bomb them
we would rescue them
administration officials also argue , with some justification , that syrians do n't want to leave their country
not one of the many that i talked to ever said we want to go to america , nikki haley , trump 's ambassador to the united nations , said to fox news.
they want to stay as close to syria as they can.
she added that the united states had spent more than $ 6 billion on the syrian conflict , including significant contributions to alleviate the plight of the millions displaced by the war.
i will tell you , from a humanitarian standpoint , the u.s. has been a massive donor to this situation , haley said
but also when i talk to the refugees , they want to go home
but the syrian war is hardly about to stop , and millions of syrians remain in limbo in cities and camps in turkey , lebanon and jordan
the massive influx over the years of these refugees has strained resources and raised the hackles of local governments and populations
the mood in turkey , whose leadership once championed its role in giving sanctuary and support to almost four million syrian refugees , has soured
local hostility to the syrians is on the rise , and so is anti-refugee violence in major turkish cities , reported my colleague erin cunningham earlier this month
many turks think syrians receive preferential access to public services and assistance ...
ethnic and religious minorities are also worried that the influx of syrians will upset the demographic balance and cause sectarian strife
turkish president recep tayyip erdogan at one point flirted with the idea of giving turkish citizenship to hundreds of thousands of syrians
now he and his government want our refugee brothers and sisters to return to their country , as he said in february
but to where
one potential plan would have ankara transplanting some 350,000 syrians to afrin , the enclave in northwestern syria that was recently captured by turkey and its rebel allies
gareth jenkins , a senior fellow at the central asia-caucasus institute , said to cunningham
for them , syria may never truly be home again
syria 's catastrophic war unraveled its society , and stitching it back together again will be no easy feat
that challenge is compounded by the total absence of collective international action to bring the war to an end
instead , syria remains the chessboard of a regional great game , with foreign powers waging proxy wars across its ravaged provinces
in its defense of the syrian regime , iran has deployed thousands of shiite fighters recruited from neighboring countries like afghanistan and pakistan
along with detachments of russian personnel , they form yet another foreign legion running roughshod over the war-torn country
meanwhile , the trump administration now seems keen on drafting other sunni arab states in the middle east to continue its mission in syria
according to the wall street journal , the white house is seeking to assemble an arab force to replace the u.s. military contingent in syria and help stabilize the northeastern part of the country after the defeat of islamic state
saudi arabia , qatar and the u.a.e
have all been approached with respect to financial support and more broadly to contribute , an administration official told the journal , while egypt is being cajoled to send its own troops to the country
erik prince , the u.s. businessman who failed to convince the white house to let him build a mercenary army for afghanistan , is now making a similar pitch for syria
the entirety of u.s. mission in syria can be outsourced at zero cost to the u.s. taxpayer and zero risk to american service personnel , prince told the journal 's dion nissenbaum
but the risks to syrians , and the price their country continues to pay for a war with no end , remain unconscionably steep
