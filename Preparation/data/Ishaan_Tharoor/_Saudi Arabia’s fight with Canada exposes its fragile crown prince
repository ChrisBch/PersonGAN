a few months ago , saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman seemed the toast of every major western capital
mbs the ubiquitous shorthand for the ambitious 32-year-old royal had embarked on an extensive global tour , calling on politicians , business elites and celebrities as part of a broader push to sell his vision of reforms for the oil-rich kingdom
at a march meeting with reporters and editors of the washington post , he said he wanted to pioneer an economic transformation that would make the middle east the next europe.
his message brimmed with liberal optimism and prompted rosy columns from leading american commentators
but an explosive diplomatic spat this week shows how fragile the crown princes narrative may be
on monday , riyadh announced it would suspend trade with canada and ordered the expulsion of the canadian ambassador
it also withdrew its own envoy in ottawa
the reason for the dramatic move
last week , canada complained about the arrests of a number of saudi civil-society figures , including samar badawi , the sister of jailed blogger raif badawi
( his wife and three children now live in quebec and became canadian citizens last year )
tweets from canadas foreign minister , chrystia freeland , and the foreign ministry itself championed human rights and the rights of female activists recently rounded up
very alarmed to learn that samar badawi , raif badawis sister , has been imprisoned in saudi arabia
canada stands together with the badawi family in this difficult time , and we continue to strongly call for the release of both raif and samar badawi
canada is gravely concerned about additional arrests of civil society and womens rights activists in saudiarabia , including samar badawi
we urge the saudi authorities to immediately release them and all other peaceful humanrights activists
reported the globe and mail
the affair took a turn for the absurd on monday , when a prominent twitter account linked to the saudi government shared an image of an airplane careening toward the toronto skyline
the tweet was deleted , but not before casting the wholly unwelcome shadow of 9/11 over proceedings and forcing an apology from a saudi embassy official in washington
meanwhile , an entire ecosystem of saudi social-media accounts continued a trolling offensive , offering their virtual support for indigenous rights in canada as well as quebecois separatism
now deleted , here a screenshot of the threatening saudi infographic featuring an airliner headed for the toronto skyline
officials in ottawa defended their stance.
canada will always stand up for the protection of human rights , including womens rights , and freedom of expression around the world , marie-pier baril , a spokeswoman for the canadian foreign ministry , said in a statement
but looming over the spat is the matter of a controversial and unfinished $ 12 billion arms deal between the two countries
the deal , inked in 2014 by a since-defeated conservative government , was upheld by liberal prime minister justin trudeau in the face of significant media criticism at home
ali shihabi , the founder of the arabia foundation , a washington-based think tank close to riyadh , told todays worldview that the crown prince has to react to western posturing as he seeks to liberalize his own country.
mbs sees himself as managing an unprecedented and delicate reform process and doesnt want outside criticism making it more difficult , let alone from allies who are beneficiaries of saudi business , he said
mbs is also increasingly seen as the steward of an incoherent and largely unsuccessful foreign policy that includes the stalemate over qatar , the ruinous war in yemen and a botched attempt to collaborate with the trump administration on the israeli-palestinian peace process
on the last matter , mbs has voiced support for the white houses vague peace plans
but there is growing disquiet in the middle east , including in riyadh , over the trump administrations near-total embrace of israeli interests over palestinian concerns
it prompted the saudi king to issue a statement last week reiterating his support for palestinian claims to jerusalem as well as refugees rights of return , a clear rebuke to trump and perhaps to the crown princes willingness to play ball with israel
