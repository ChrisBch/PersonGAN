as you have certainly heard by now , secretary of state rex tillerson was unceremoniously fired via president trump 's twitter account tuesday morning
you could argue that his departure was long in the works
there were whispers as early as last summer that the former exxonmobil ceo was on the way out
he had clashed with trump on numerous matters of policy and even reportedly once growled to colleagues that the president was a moron.
now , he 's the first u.s. secretary of state to be fired in the post-world war ii era
trump apparently wanted to drop the guillotine while tillerson was on a mission to africa over the weekend the washington post , in breaking the story , first reported that tillerson was told about his sacking on friday
but it now that appears trump spoke to tillerson only in the hours after the tweet
steve goldstein , a top state department official under tillerson , told reporters that his boss learned of his firing through social media and was unaware of the reason he was forced out
goldstein was terminated by the white house soon thereafter
in place of the oft-maligned secretary of state , trump named cia director mike pompeo for the job
mike pompeo , director of the cia , will become our new secretary of state
he will do a fantastic job
thank you to rex tillerson for his service
gina haspel will become the new director of the cia , and the first woman so chosen
congratulations to all
later tuesday , a visibly tired tillerson delivered a short set of remarks at the state department , thanking career diplomats for their honesty and integrity and praising the kindness of the american people
he said his formal departure would come at the end of the month
he did n't mention trump 's name once
that 's not surprising
the president had steadily undermined tillerson 's credibility by publicly contradicting him on north korea and the tense diplomatic standoff in the persian gulf
news reports made clear that trump resented tillerson 's support for international pacts such as the iran nuclear deal and the paris climate accords
the secretary of state also pushed back against trump 's instincts to withdraw from afghanistan and move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem
as trump put it tuesday , we were not really thinking the same.
tillerson 's detractors believe he will go down as one of the ineffectual secretaries of state in the history of american diplomacy
they see him as an aloof business titan who alienated and demoralized a huge segment of the foreign service corps while acceding to potentially crippling budget cuts and hiring freezes
and , some reports suggested , he simply was n't that good at his job
but u.s. allies are still concerned by tillerson 's removal
many shared the opinion of sen. bob corker ( r-tenn. ) , who declared in october that the secretary of state was one of a few officials who help separate our country from chaos.
tillerson 's firing came as british officials looked for concrete u.s. support after of an alleged russian chemical attack carried out on english soil
the departing secretary of state , unlike the u.s. president , had been vocal in his criticism of moscow and steadier in his spoken commitments to the united states traditional allies

contrast that with pompeo , the cia director who has forged a genuinely close relationship with trump.
weve had a very good chemistry right from the beginning , trump said after discussing his disagreements with tillerson
some washington insiders believe that bond will make pompeo more effective in office , but it has others concerned
pompeo is a vociferous hawk on iran and counts among his allies some of the most well-known islamophobes in the united states
( trump 's designated successor to pompeo 's vacated post , meanwhile , is deeply linked to a controversial cia torture program under the george w. bush administration )
earlier , pompeo was a leader of the republican house effort to hold the obama administration responsible for the killings of four americans in benghazi , libya , in 2012 , and questioned the wisdom of traditional multilateralism.
