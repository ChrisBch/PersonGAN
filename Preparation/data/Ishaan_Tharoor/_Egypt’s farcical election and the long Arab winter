egyptians will have one last chance to head to the polls on wednesday , the last of three days of balloting in the country 's presidential election
however long it takes to tabulate the result , the winner is not in doubt
president abdel fatah al-sissi will secure a fresh mandate after his government detained , intimidated or otherwise sidelined any real challengers ahead of the vote
by doing so , sissi has extinguished the last glimmers of the democratic hope unleashed by mass protests in 2011
under his watch , some analysts argue , egypt is backsliding to a state of autocracy even worse than the rule of former president hosni mubarak , whose three-decade dictatorship was brought to an end by those protests
sissis expected victory appears likely to tighten his grip on the government , politics and society , making him perhaps the most controlling leader in egypts modern history , my colleagues sudarsan raghavan and heba farouk mahfouz reported from cairo
but it will also raise the expectations of egypts more than 100 million people , most of them living in poverty
while the economy is showing signs of a rebound , severe austerity measures , rising prices and lowered subsidies have worsened the lives of a majority of egyptians , including the middle class
egypt 's presidential election is going on now
here 's our quick synopsis of how serious challengers to current president abdel fattah al-sisi were forced out of the race
much like russia 's vladimir putin , sissi cares greatly about turnout
in the wake of the 2013 military coup that brought him to power , sissi successfully styled himself as the savior of the nation , the steady hand who would bring stability back to the country while ruthlessly quashing islamist dissent
but in recent years , as terror threats persisted and the economy still struggled , his mystique has worn thin
a strong showing at the polls would help buttress his legitimacy
said timothy kaldas , a cairo-based analyst with the tahrir institute for middle east policy , to the wall street journal
instead , he said , the government turned to mubarak-era infrastructure to get people to the polls.
that included rather tactless forms of coercion
the regional government plans to build a new playground , nursery or event hall in the top three districts , the state news agency said
similar promises were proffered in other parts of the country
but even as sissi sought to mobilize public support , his regime has presided over a far-reaching clampdown on civil society and opposition
over the past year , the repression has deepened , my colleagues reported
hundreds of websites viewed as critical of the regime have been blocked , and travel bans and other repressive measures have been imposed on activists
numerous opponents have been jailed or 'forcibly disappeared , while extrajudicial killings are increasing , human rights groups say
the human rights community in egypt and abroad has long tracked the role of military intelligence in state killings , torture and disappearances , wrote analyst mona el-ghobashy
the broader public remains in the dark , cowed or captive to the official creed that the state protects the population
still , criticism from the international community is muted at best
the egyptian president has vociferous backing from the royal houses of the persian gulf the saudis and emiratis reviled the upheavals that allowed populist islamists such as the muslim brotherhood to win power and have helped shore up sissi 's position
president trump has also been a conspicuous cheerleader for sissi , praising him for his tough view on extremists while eschewing the pro-democracy or rule-of-law rhetoric of his predecessors
in short , things could n't be further removed from the 2011 arab spring , which began with protests in tunisia but turned into an epochal event when anti-mubarak demonstrators took over cairo 's tahrir square
even sissi 's main opponent condemns the revolution
the 'arab spring has resulted in a catastrophe in the region , said moussa mostafa moussa , an obscure political figure who supported sissi before agreeing to run against him , in an interview with russia 's state-sponsored sputnik news
for good measure , he blamed the uprising on washington this huge u.s. project was implemented by the team of former secretary of state condoleezza rice
its aim was to overthrow the leadership of all the arab countries and to divide the states into smaller countries
after the election , sissi may tighten his grip even further
the vote , wrote michael wahid hanna , a senior fellow at the century foundation , is a procedural hurdle to clear before the much more consequential effort of constitutional change
amending the constitution to formalize egypts autocracy has previously been suggested by parliamentarians and allies of the regime
but that may prove to be a more difficult challenge for sissi than winning reelection
debate over constitutional changes also represents perhaps the only opportunity to organize domestic and international opposition to the sissi regimes increasingly aggressive efforts to concentrate power in the president , hanna wrote
in egypt , there is no democracy , said abdelrahman , a cairene taxi driver , to my colleagues.
democracy in egypt only comes with the gun
