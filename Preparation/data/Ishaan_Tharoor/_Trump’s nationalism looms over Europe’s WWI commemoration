president trump will join a group of more than 60 world leaders in france this weekend to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of world war i
the war lives on in the western imagination as a hideous ( and arguably needless ) conflict that killed millions , turned the fields of europe into moonscapes , collapsed empires and prefigured an even bloodier war a generation later
its memory and legacy still offer profound lessons for the present
in hosting the ceremonies , french president emmanuel macron hopes to score a political point
world war i was a clash of violent nationalist passions , fueled by a coterie of power-hungry elites
now theres a rising tide of nationalism in europe , with far-right leaders in western europe and illiberal statesmen in countries such as hungary challenging the liberal ideals of the european union and the cooperation and multilateralism that once guaranteed its prosperity
he said recently
today president emmanuelmacron visits the notre-dame-de-lorette national cemetery to visit the anneau de la mmoire , or the memory ring , to honor the wwicentennial and the 100s of thousands of soldiers from 40 different nations who perished in nord-pas-de-calais during wwi
that message is unlikely to get through to trump
his treaty busting and ally bullying have strained trans-atlantic ties and encouraged europes anti-establishment forces
his overt nationalism and embrace of protectionism , critics say , have undermined american leadership and called into question the future of the international order constructed by the united states after world war ii
that is , a decision to eschew the internationalism of then-president woodrow wilson for the isolationism of his interwar successors
trumps america first agenda also harks back to that historic withdrawal , when skepticism about foreign entanglements and fear of immigrants defined national policy at home and abroad
this circling of the wagons had significant geopolitical consequences
in 1919 and 1920 , the u.s. senate rejected signing the treaty of versailles and joining the league of nations , the new international organization intended to stave off future bloody catastrophes
the american absence possibly doomed the project at its birth
video 72,396 shrouded figures , part of the installation shrouds of the somme by british artist rob heard , are laid out in london to represent commonwealth servicemen in wwi who died at the somme and have no known grave
but this view gets it precisely backward , daalder argued
it was the effects of american disengagement after world war i that convinced the next generation of u.s. strategists to build the international institutions and security pacts that defined the latter half of the 20th century and brought lasting peace to europe
