last december , nikki haley , the u.s. ambassador to the united nations , held a news conference highlighting what she described as proof of irans role in supplying illicit weapons to yemens houthi rebels
a ballistic missile fired at riyadh by the houthis the month before a failed attempt to hit a major airport there apparently carried components manufactured by an iranian firm
this , haley argued , was devastating evidence of iranian perfidy
others diplomats werent so sure
they suggested the american envoy was overstating the conclusions drawn by u.n. investigators and possibly seeking to divert attention away from the trump administrations controversial moves elsewhere in the middle east
its worth considering haleys adamant stance in light of what has happened since
the failed houthi missile strike caused no casualties , but it prompted saudi arabia and its persian gulf allies to tighten their blockade on yemen and intensify the war against the houthis
since then , the countrys epochal humanitarian crisis has only worsened , and airstrikes carried out by the saudi-led coalition have killed dozens of civilians
the most glaring incident happened less than two weeks ago , when a missile struck a bus in northern yemen
according to local health officials , 54 people were killed , 44 of whom were children traveling on a rare school outing
bloodied schoolbags belonging to children who never came home after an airstrike by the saudi-led coalition yemen
at least 33 children were killed
where does saudi arabia get most of its arms
from britain and the us
the bbcs orla guerin , reporting from the scene days later , described the agony of parents finding their dead children among piles of corpses she spoke to young boys helping dig small graves for their classmates
meanwhile , saudi officials said the bus was a legitimate military target , pointing to allegations that the houthis are training child soldiers
the united states , as weve detailed in the past , has abetted the saudi-led war in yemen , helping refuel aircraft and supplying intelligence and munitions to the coalition
but while trump administration officials leap to conclusions about the iranian hand in yemens ruinous war , they are far more coy about their own
when pressed about the american role in the deadly strike , a senior u.s. official expressed apathy
over the weekend , cnn concluded that it was an american bomb manufactured by lockheed martin , an influential defense contractor that sent dozens of yemeni children to their deaths
the report cited munition experts and shrapnel evidence from the scene of the strike
while the trump administration may wave away its actions in yemen , theres a growing uproar in washington about the horrors of the war
haleys performance last year did not silence critics , who are unconvinced by trumps arguments about checking iranian influence
and while the saudis and their u.s. allies have a point when it comes to pinning the blame on the houthis , argued frank giustra and robert malley of the international crisis group , its not a strong one
as my colleague missy ryan reported , lawmakers in congress are citing the catalogue of civilian casualties as grounds to establish greater oversight over the war
rep. ted lieu ( d-calif. ) wrote in a letter to the pentagons inspector general
sen. elizabeth warren ( d-mass )
sought clarification from gen. joseph votel , the head of u.s. central command , over how the u.s. military helps support and oversee saudi and emirati bombing missions in yemen
the violence in yemen and the mounting evidence of american complicity in atrocities is fueling a broader conversation about the white houses ability to wage war
the trump administration is following the obama administrations tacit support of the saudi-led campaign , but has likely emboldened riyadh with its vehement grandstanding over iran and the houthis
elsewhere , president trump has also prioritized strength of arms over diplomacy
in syria , trump celebrated his militarys ruthless bombing campaign against the islamic state , which helped drive out the militants from the city of raqqa
but now , after laying waste to the city , trump wants to cut the u.s. funds set aside to help its recovery and reconstruction a paltry $ 230 million compared to the $ 716 billion defense spending bill trump signed last week
the united states has ended the ridiculous 230 million dollar yearly development payment to syria
saudi arabia and other rich countries in the middle east will start making payments instead of the u.s
i want to develop the u.s. , our military and countries that help us
trump insists that u.s. allies , including the saudis , can foot the bill to clean up the mess in syria
but critics say the white house needs to get tough on its friends in the gulf rather than simply eyeing their purse strings
