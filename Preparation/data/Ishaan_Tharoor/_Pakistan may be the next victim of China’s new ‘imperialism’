its been barely more than two weeks since imran khans electoral victory in pakistan , but the countrys next prime minister is already facing a geopolitical crisis
pakistans account deficit is perilously high , its foreign-currency reserves perilously low
its external debt has ballooned after accepting some $ 62 billion in chinese financing , part of an ambitious regional infrastructure project that has yet to boost pakistans economy
khans first major act as prime minister may be asking the international monetary fund for a new bailout
but thats where the trouble begins
critics at home lament pakistans addiction to the fund it has spent 22 of the past 30 years laboring under the terms of more than a dozen successive imf bailouts
the austerity measures the imf demands , they argue , have shackled growth and prevented pakistan from making substantive reforms
pakistan could instead turn to china for fresh loans , but that could make islamabad even more beholden to beijing than it already is
in that regard , pakistan is becoming the latest testing ground of a key plank in chinas global strategy
its sweeping belt and road initiative a vast $ 1 trillion infrastructure and development plan that has led to chinese companies investing in bridges , airports , dams , railroads and other ventures in dozens of countries is beijings signature global project
but it has prompted accusations that it fuels corruption and autocratic behavior in vulnerable countries
from malaysia to colombia , the opacity surrounding chinese-backed endeavors has led to allegations of graft , mismanagement and , in the case of at least one mega-dam project , possibly triggered a devastating landslide
moreover , the initiative has pushed some countries into a morass of debt
the starkest example so far has been sri lanka , whose government was unable to repay $ 6 billion in loans used to build an expensive chinese-led port and airport project in hambantota , a once-sleepy but strategically located backwater
as a result , sri lankan authorities ceded control of the port and some 15,000 acres of land around it to beijing on a 99-year lease
the move led to accusations that china is engaging in a 21st-century style of creditor imperialism.
at a tuesday panel in washington , christine fair , a south asia expert at georgetown university , quipped that the chinese-pakistan economic corridor the formal name for a complex $ 62 billion infrastructure-development plan actually should be called colonizing pakistan to enrich china.
both chinese and pakistani officials argue that charges of colonialism are overblown
the two countries share a historic friendship , largely framed by their mutual antipathy toward india
noted an editorial in chinas state-run global times , urging beijing officials to ignore the noise and step up its investment in pakistan.
khan , meanwhile , is a fiery nationalist and economic populist
he has repeatedly gestured to the china model as something pakistan should emulate
but its not yet clear what any of that means in practice , and the enthusiasm for his rhetoric may simply reflect widespread frustration with pakistans systemic corruption and long-standing habit of turning to the imf and accepting its diktats
2/2 i will visit china in june
keen to learn how they brought 500 m ppl out of poverty & raised gdp from $ 30b to $ 10 trillion within 30 yrs
as tensions flare between china and the united states over trade , that hawkish outlook is only gaining support
in washington , lawmakers are increasingly wary about chinas opportunistic maneuvering across asia , africa and latin america
for pakistan , caught between chinas ambition and washingtons concern , there are few good choices
these are our two masters , turab hussain , an economics professor at lahore university of management sciences , told the new york times.
how do you serve both
