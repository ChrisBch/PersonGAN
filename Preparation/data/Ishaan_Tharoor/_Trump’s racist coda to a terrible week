even if it was intended as a distraction from the legal madness of the week , president trumps latest race-baiting message shouldnt be ignored
the president tweeted a bizarre non sequitur on wednesday , warning of the supposed perils facing white farmers in south africa
trump said he had asked secretary of state mike pompeo to closely study the large scale killing of white farmers in south africa and the expropriation of their land
trumps concern was apparently prompted like so much of his commentary on social media by something he saw on fox news , in this case a segment on tucker carlsons evening show
carlson , who has used his prime-time spot to broadcast fringe talking points from white nationalists , anti-feminists and far-right xenophobes , alleged that the state department was standing aside as south african authorities carried out a campaign to dispossess whites
i have asked secretary of state secpompeo to closely study the south africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers.
south african government is now seizing land from white farmers.
in fact , the data shows that slayings of south african farmers are at a two-decade low
moreover , carlson ignored the context in which these expropriations which have yet to take place are being discussed
the redistribution of land is a fundamental part of dismantling south africas apartheid state , which was built on the legal dispossession of blacks
since the end of apartheid in 1994 , efforts toward redistribution have been piecemeal and inadequate , with a minority of whites still owning a huge majority of the countrys agricultural land
my colleagues reported
land reform is now the subject of heated political debate in south africa and may overshadow elections next year
south african president cyril ramaphosa wants to accelerate redistribution as a way to cope with the entrenched inequities within south african society
one measure under consideration is a constitutional amendment that would permit expropriation of land without compensation , a move its proponents believe is just in light of south africas history of colonial plunder and racist domination
noted a statement from the anti-defamation league.
we would hope that the president would try to understand the facts and realities of the situation in south africa , rather than repeat disturbing , racially divisive talking points used most frequently by white supremacists
patrick gaspard , a former u.s. ambassador to south africa , saw trumps tweet as a cynical gambit by a president who has shown no actual interest in africa
and , in a tweet , the south african government rejected trumps comments
south africa totally rejects this narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past
but the western far right , including former ku klux klan leader david duke , hailed trumps message
for many , south africa is ground zero for the mythic white genocide , in which liberals and nonwhites are building a world where miscegenation and immigration threaten the future of the white race
activism by an afrikaner nationalist organization representing white farmers encouraged far-right voices elsewhere to give that fever dream a glimmer of plausibility
meanwhile , the far right has a conspicuous nostalgia for the racist colonial regimes that once ruled southern africa
dylann roof , the white-nationalist gunman who murdered nine black churchgoers in charleston in 2015 , maintained a blog called the last rhodesian , a reference to the white settler state that once ran what is now zimbabwe
analysts tracking hate groups in the united states have seen a surge in pro-rhodesian messaging that extends well beyond roof
online stores have emerged to hawk memorabilia echoing the slogans of the brutal rhodesian paramilitaries of the 1970s and 1980s
such arguments may still be on the margins of the american political conversation , but figures such as carlson are increasingly bringing them into living rooms each night
and , as my colleagues report , trumps parroting of carlsons agenda is part of the white houses own strategy to play on white grievance and fear of immigration ahead of this years midterm elections
that dog whistle is now as loud as a siren
