president trumps reintroduction of sanctions on iran isnt going over well with the international community
on wednesday , the united nations highest court ordered the united states to remove any restrictions on the export of humanitarian goods and services to iran
the court didnt give iran the sweeping ruling against all sanctions that it hoped , but enough to claim a moral victory
but the icj doesnt have the power to enforce its rulings , and the trump administration wasnt about to let foreign judges constrain its actions
secretary of state mike pompeo quickly announced that the united states was withdrawing from the treaty of amity
iran , he said , had been violating it for an awfully long time , anyway
then , at a white house briefing , national security adviser john bolton announced that the administration was reviewing all agreements that could subject the united states to future rulings by the court
but other governments still do
during meetings at the united nations last week , trump , pompeo and bolton railed against iran and berated various other member states and u.n. bodies for not bending to american interests
their approach elicited an icy reaction
at a security council session chaired by president trump , every other member of the u.n. 's most powerful body scolded washington for its rejection of the nuclear deal , an agreement the council had endorsed
un top court rules that us must comply with obligations violated by re-imposing sanctions on iranian people when exiting jcpoa
another failure for sanctions-addicted usg and victory for rule of law
imperative for intl community to collectively counter malign us unilateralism
us abrogated jcpoa -a multilateral accord enshrined in unsc resolution 2231- arguing that it seeks a bilateral treaty with iran
today us withdrew from an actual us-iran treaty after the icj ordered it to stop violating that treaty in sanctioning iranian people
irans political leadership is enjoying its moment of international solidarity
after the icj ruling , foreign minister javad zarif termed the united states an outlaw regime in pursuit of a malign agenda , parroting u.s. attacks on tehran
meanwhile , iranian president hassan rouhani welcomed a european proposal to create a barter system in which companies could trade with iran without money changing hands , thus skirting u.s. sanctions.
europe has taken a big step , he said
wrote anna holligan , the bbcs correspondent in the hague
away from the chambers of u.n. organizations , however , the picture is a bit gloomier for tehran
irans financial sector has long been a mess
its currency , the rial , has lost about 70 percent of its value since may
one analysis by a group of economists forecasts that the countrys economy could contract close to 4 percent in 2019 a collapse driven largely by the reimposition of oil sanctions , which will come into place next month
said patrick clawson , director of research at the washington institute for near east policy , speaking at a panel on iran held by the center for the national interest in washington
trump and the anti-iran ideologues in his administration have cited the difficulties faced by the regime as well as the economic protests that have flared up in various parts of the country as evidence of a nation ready for real political change
they believe the sanctions will galvanize the iranian opposition and force the countrys leaders to curb their support for their armed proxies across the middle east
but some analysts fear the sanctions will have the opposite effect
figures such as rouhani and zarif have drawn popular ire over the countrys economic mismanagement , but they dont make the final decisions on irans military footprint abroad
the theocratic regimes hardliners , particularly among its revolutionary guard corps , control that portfolio
and with recent polling suggesting that iranians still largely support their countrys foreign policy , the mullahs have little incentive to change course
said barbara slavin of the atlantic council , speaking at the same event
she pointed to the surging popularity of qassem soleimani , a key leader within the irgc , whose foreign proxies are engaged in conflicts in iraq , syria and yemen
todays cij_icj ruling was a defeat for iran , which has hypocritically and groundlessly abused the court as a forum for attacking the u.s
in light of this , i am announcing that the u.s. is terminating the treaty of amity w/ iran -- this is a decision that is 39 years overdue
slavin said , referring to the hopes of many people who backed the nuclear deal.
now the military will become stronger.
key u.s. allies also fear the dangers of trumps path
speaking with reporters in washington on wednesday , ahmed mahjoub , iraqs chief foreign-affairs spokesman , warned that sanctions will hurt ordinary iraqis , who are vulnerable to economic chaos next door
