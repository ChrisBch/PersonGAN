saudi authorities have spent almost two months obfuscating what happened to slain journalist jamal khashoggi
all the while , the white house has played along , seeking to tamp down the outrage over khashoggis murder at the saudi consulate in istanbul and shield mohammed bin salman , the saudi crown prince linked to khashoggis death
after first denying any hand in khashoggis disappearance , riyadh eventually admitted to presiding over his death in what the saudis said was a botched operation carried out by rogue agents
last week , a saudi prosecutor announced charges against 11 participants in the plot against khashoggi , five of whom could face the death penalty
the prosecutor , as well as other prominent saudi officials , emphasized that the crown prince had nothing to do with the crime
but that claim took a sharp blow over the weekend , when the washington post revealed that the cia has concluded mohammed himself ordered khashoggis assassination
the cia says with high confidence that mbs ordered khashoggis killing.trump will anybody really know
all right , will anybody really know
as a european intelligence official told the guardian , the cias analysis is highly damaging to the kingdoms official narrative.
the agency believes it is unlikely such an operation would have been carried out without the knowledge of mbs , as the crown prince is often called
scrutiny of audio recordings from inside the consulate in istanbul as well as intercepted phone calls by saudi officials including at least one between a member of the hit squad and a close aide to the crown prince further cemented their conclusion
said heather nauert , the state departments spokeswoman.
there remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of mr. khashoggi
the state department will continue to seek all relevant facts
earlier in the week , white house national security adviser john bolton insisted that the intelligence he had seen did not implicate mbs
trump , when pressed by reporters again saturday , said little information had been assessed and that his administration would make its position clear on tuesday
as my colleagues at the posts editorial page argued , part of trumps reticence may be due to his congenital unwillingness to admit that he was wrong in this case , in placing such a big bet on mbs as a staunch u.s. ally
this is a situation where everyone basically knows what happened , said a trump adviser who spoke to my colleagues on the condition of anonymity , indicating that trump privately seemed to also believe that the crown prince was behind the murder
the right-wing government of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu also has publicly come to the defense of the crown prince , who shares netanyahus antipathy toward iran and reportedly harbors great admiration for israels economic success
in trump , both the saudis and israelis have found an american leader eager to endorse their visions for the middle east
mohammeds reckless behavior was already the subject of widespread scrutiny
critics place blame on him for both the ruinous war in yemen and a sweeping purge of rivals within the royal family and the saudi business elite
but the death of khashoggi , a virginia resident with many influential friends in washington , has focused attention on how the administrations own policies have further enabled that recklessness
on capitol hill , though , its a different story
lawmakers from both parties are preparing to raise the pressure on riyadh
