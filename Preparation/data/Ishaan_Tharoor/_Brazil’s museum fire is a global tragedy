there have been no injuries reported after an enormous fire gutted rio de janeiro 's national museum on sunday , but the toll was still immense
officials suggested as much as 90 percent of the museum 's collection encompassing about 20 million objects was destroyed by the blaze
some of the museum 's treasures may have survived , including the remains of luzia , an 11,500-year-old fossil believed to be the oldest human skeleton unearthed in the americas
their graceful images of peacocks and coiled dragons withstood the eruption of mount vesuvius two millennia ago , but they may now be lost
firefighters in brazil think they found the skull of luzia , an 11,500-year-old skeleton that was the star attraction at its burned national museum
about 90 % of its collection is believed to be destroyed
curators and academics are struggling to come to terms with the scale of the disaster
for some , it meant the disintegration of a career.
in terms of my life-long research agenda , i 'm pretty much lost , said marcus guidoti , a brazilian entomologist , to national geographic
the museum 's collection of lace bugs the world 's largest and the rest of its 5 million arthropod specimens were all probably destroyed
according to my colleague alex horton , gomes likened the event to the burning of the great library in alexandria , egypt , in 48 b.c
a timeless metaphor for the catastrophic disappearance of human knowledge
museum director alexander kellner told the guardian.
the collection of the museum is not for the history of rio de janeiro or brazil , it is fundamental to world history
the national museum , the largest of its kind in latin america , is an artifact of history itself
the 19th-century palace that was its main building was once home to the portuguese royal family and a short-lived brazilian imperial dynasty
it was the site of the signing of the country 's independence decree in 1822 and the birthplace of one of its emperors
and , as was the case with many of the great museums in the 19th century , it built its priceless collections through at times violent and brutal means
this year , the museum was preparing to celebrate the 200th anniversary of its founding
now university students in rio are collecting photos taken by visitors to build a mournful virtual memorial to the objects once housed there
it 's still unclear what caused the fire
authorities speculated that a paper balloon carrying a small flame may have landed on the museum 's roof
according to the new york times , investigators are also looking into whether a short circuit in one of the institution 's laboratories could have triggered the fire
tragically , the preponderance of printed material , rare books and documents in the museum 's archives may have fed the blaze
people are wrapping the museum in a symbolic embrace
but while the flames have been subdued , they stoked brazilians ire
protesters clashed with police in rio , linking the ruin of the national museum to wider austerity measures and spending cuts that have left the country 's infrastructure in woeful disrepair
reports point out that the building 's sprinkler system was not functioning properly firefighters had to dredge water from a nearby pond because the hydrants by the museum did not work
brazilian president michel temer who has faced numerous allegations of graft since coming to power in 2016 promised to raise private and public funds to help restore the museum and rebuild its collections
but museum officials point to a long legacy of budget cuts and neglect
the building itself was not insured
earlier this year , the museum had to use a crowdfunding website to help raise $ 7,000 to deal with a termite infestation that had forced the closure of an exhibit
brazilian author paulo coelho lamented in the guardian.
poor people in brazil do not go to school , let alone to museums
rich people go to museums but in london , new york or paris , not in rio or so paulo
others are clinging to thin reeds of optimism
as workers searched the wreckage of the museums , they discovered that another iconic treasure , an ancient iron meteorite discovered by an 18th-century brazilian cattle herder , had survived the flames
we still do not know what , but i have hope
