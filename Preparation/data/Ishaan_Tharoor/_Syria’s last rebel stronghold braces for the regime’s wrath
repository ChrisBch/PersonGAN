after seven brutal years of war , all signs are pointing to a final showdown in syria
the regime of president bashar al-assad , buoyed by support from russia and iran , has systematically reclaimed territories once in the hands of insurgents
now it is preparing an offensive against the last rebel enclave idlib , a largely rural province that abuts the countrys northwestern border with turkey
international observers are warning of a potential humanitarian catastrophe
there is a perfect storm coming up in front of our eyes , said staffan de mistura , the united nations envoy to syria
roughly 3 million people live in idlib , more than half of whom are syrians displaced from other parts of the country
as rebel bastions fell to assad 's forces in other parts of the country , tens of thousands of civilians trapped in those areas agreed to be evacuated to idlib as part of cease-fire deals brokered with the regime
the province became a hotbed of the syrian opposition , including a number of islamist militant factions that dominate the enclave
the most powerful is hayat tahrir al-sham ( hts ) , an islamist militant group formerly affiliated with al-qaeda that has participated in terrorist attacks and the killing of civilians
idlib is also home to vast camps of displaced people and endemic poverty as many 1.6 million people in the province rely on food assistance , according to the world health organization
with turkey leery of welcoming a new wave of refugees the country already hosts more than 3 million syrians there are growing fears that civilians in idlib may be cornered
over the years , hundreds of civilians have been killed there in airstrikes by regime and russian warplanes
on thursday , de mistura urged the creation of a humanitarian corridor and suggested that civilians consider fleeing back to regime-controlled territory , a proposal representatives of the opposition said was regrettable
but such pleas echo the desperate appeals made by the united nations in the past , entreaties that went largely unheeded as the syrian regime quashed resistance in homs , aleppo , damascus and elsewhere
assad and his allies seem in no mood for compromise this time , either
the regime is talking up the liberation of idlib from thousands of terrorists , and my colleague louisa loveluck reported thursday that the syrian army has been dropping leaflets urging rebels and their supporters to surrender
until when will you and your families live in fear and anxiety
how long will your children remain without hope or future
russia is equally unyielding
on wednesday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov described the province 's militants as festering abscesses that should be liquidated
the russian navy will begin a major exercise in the mediterranean on saturday , probably in preparation for an offensive by syrian government forces
according to reuters , the drills appear aimed at deterring the west from carrying out strikes on syrian government forces
sergey lavrov & foreign minister of syria walid muallem have met in moscow today
washington is struggling to influence events on the ground
the trump administration seems more immediately preoccupied with the prospect of islamist fighters scattering farther afield , and it has urged turkey to fortify its small presence of outposts in idlib to help defeat islamist militant groups , al-monitor reported
on thursday , turkish president recep tayyip erdogan said he was in talks with russian and iranian counterparts in a bid to head off the crisis and maintain a cease-fire
erdogan 's position has shifted markedly since earlier stages of the war , when ankara loudly clamored for assad 's ouster and supported a number of rebel factions
analysts say he made a losing bet in backing assads downfall and now is coming around to the scenario that he sought to prevent
though turkey retains influence over the rebels in idlib , it has increasingly found common cause with assad 's patrons
moscow wants ankara to reconcile with the assad regime , wrote joost hiltermann of the international crisis group
turkeys reliance on russia to protect itself from the kurdish separatists and prevent a new surge of refugees , this time from idlib , may therefore force it into an accommodation with damascus that it has successfully resisted until now
as my colleague reported , ankara could isolate idlib 's hard-line factions , such as hts , by persuading other rebel groups there to accept a negotiated settlement with the assad government
idlibs fate now rests with turkey and russia , loveluck wrote
although on opposite sides of the conflict ankara supports the rebels and moscow is one of assads major allies the two powers share an interest in averting a humanitarian catastrophe
their diplomacy on the matter is likely to culminate sept. 7 when they meet in the kazakh capital , astana , along with iran
whatever this diplomatic process yields , the picture for syrians remains bleak
outside idlib , with the war largely won , the assad government is calling for the millions of refugees living in limbo abroad to come home
but foreign governments and international rights groups warn that conditions are hardly right for return
many refugees fear reprisal attacks from government loyalists
we cant go back because of the risk of neighbors petty revenge , a syrian refugee in lebanon told the guardian
they snitch on you and call you a traitor and the next thing you know youre languishing in prison , for nothing
my town is filled with regime forces and thugs
how do they expect me to return
millions in idlib now are bracing for this final push
