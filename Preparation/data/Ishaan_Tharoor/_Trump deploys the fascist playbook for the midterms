president trumps message is as clear as it is ugly fearmongering about illegal immigration will deliver his party the votes it needs to retain control of congress
and so , in the final stretch before next weeks midterm election , the president and his allies have launched a blitzkrieg of misinformation
in a move unprecedented in modern american history , trump ordered thousands of active-duty troops to the border to intercept a caravan of central american migrants , casting them as a menacing invasion of unknown middle easterners and other shadowy elements
his allies at right-wing media outlets spread lurid conspiracy theories about liberals enabling disease-bearing foreigners to infiltrate the country
even as attention shifted to a spate of right-wing violence , including the slaughter of 11 people at a pittsburgh synagogue that critics linked to the presidents rhetoric , trump barreled on , undaunted
on thursday , he gave a speech at the white house where he warned that u.s. troops would shoot violent migrants at the border
he also shared an ad that sought to connect the democratic party to murders carried out by a man twice deported to mexico , and then to link the mans murderous behavior to the supposed threat posed by all migrants

this overt turn toward white nationalism is perhaps the dominant theme of trumps time in office
and while it may be a cynical electoral gimmick for trump himself , there are senior advisers in the white house who harbor sweeping , anti-immigrant visions for america and are arguably as focused on curtailing legal immigration as they are illegal crossings
observed bosnian-american author aleksandar hemon in an essay this week
but that isnt quite the point
to link trump to fascism is not to assume that hes the second coming of hitler it is to point to worrying currents swirling through american democracy and the treacherous path down which the president is leading the nation
in a new book , yale philosopher jason stanley connected trumps demagogic instincts to earlier authoritarian moments
he observed how trumps stated mission to defeat washington corruption drain the swamp echoed the anti-corruption politics of 20th century fascists , who rode anti-establishment feeling to power only to engage in widespread graft of their own
( indeed , the trump administration , embroiled in myriad ethical scandals involving key officials , is an archetypical swamp creature )
trumps pitch is aimed precisely at voters who believe the traditional order is being subverted , those who yearn for the restoration of a mythical american grandeur
his critics have argued that he panders to such divisive , ultranationalist sentiment because his party is fighting a losing battle on key issues such as health care and taxes
a fascist culture war presents their greatest hope
this may be the most desperate and vile ad since willie horton
trump and republicans do n't want to talk about the fact that they plan to repeal the aca , gut social security , medicare , & medicaid , and cut taxes even further for their donors , so they 've resorted to fearmongering
but no front-page headline or tv network in the united states would outright label a president , party or segment of the electorate as fascist.
indeed , right-wing boosters of trump have sought to turn the table , framing criticism of the president in the mainstream media as an extension of a supposedly fascist-leftist cabal
wrote historian timothy snyder , an expert on the atrocities carried out both by the third reich and stalins soviet union
voters may add to trumps pain next week
