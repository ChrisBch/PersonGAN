president trump seems to be digging in for a full-fledged trade war with china
on monday , the white house announced that it will impose tariffs on an additional $ 200 billion worth of chinese goods , a move that follows the apparent failure of recent talks between u.s. and chinese officials
the new salvo will overshadow or perhaps wholly undermine a recent invitation from treasury secretary steven mnuchin to beijing to rekindle negotiations
earlier in the day , trump displayed his appetite for a fight in a series of tweets hailing his protectionist maneuvers , which he claims have significantly boosted the u.s. economy
white house officials later told my colleagues that trump will further add to the new slate of tariffs on china should beijing retaliate , as it is expected to do
tariffs have put the u.s. in a very strong bargaining position , with billions of dollars , and jobs , flowing into our country - and yet cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable
if countries will not make fair deals with us , they will be tariffed
will hurt americans more
the new tariffs are part of a greater effort by trump to confront beijing
after his administration imposed import duties on chinese goods this summer , china responded with tit-for-tat measures its officials argued were gestures of restraint
now , rather than cooling tensions , trump is opting for escalation , seeing a potential trade war as a winning political strategy at home ahead of the november midterms and his own 2020 reelection bid
this goes against the instincts of many senior wall street executives and even some white house advisers , who , though happy with trumps tax cuts , are less thrilled by his willingness to unleash chaos upon the global economy
on sunday , a group of leading american financiers met their counterparts in beijing for a meeting on u.s.-china business ties that seemed to underscore their diminished clout
u.s. farmers are already feeling the pain of retaliatory tariffs enacted by china , the european union and other countries targeted by the trump administrations trade actions
future reprisals from beijing could raise costs even further for u.s. manufacturers
at the financiers forum in beijing on sunday , lou jiwei , a former chinese finance minister , suggested that china could target the supply chains of prominent u.s. companies , such as apple , that are dependent on chinese manufacturing
though alarming to many american executives , such rhetoric would gladden some of the trade hawks within the trump administration , who would love to further decouple the u.s. and chinese economies
thats something analysts in both countries would have deemed unthinkable before trumps ascension
but now , as some trump allies hope to foster a split , chinese president xi jinping is also actively pushing for his countrys independence from u.s.-made technology
the trump administration plans to announce a large tax increase on american consumers this evening
tariff is just a fancy word for tax
james zimmerman , a former chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china , said to my colleague danielle paquette.
xi has no choice but to stand firm and stand tall.
as paquette reported , chinas middle class , oft animated by nationalist currents , wants to see beijing take a tough line against trump
