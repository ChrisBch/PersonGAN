the trump administration 's messaging around syria has only gotten more confusing in recent days
as some of the war 's biggest outside players jockeyed in ankara , reports indicated that the united states is building two new military bases in northern syria
about 2,000 u.s. troops are stationed there in support of kurdish and arab militias allied with washington
the islamic state is in retreat , driven from the vast majority of the territory it once commanded , but military commanders and government officials speak of staying the course and stabilizing areas once controlled by the militants
a suspect measurement of the cost of the u.s. war effort in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere
trump , of course , is liable to change his mind at any time or simply not follow through on his proclamations
after all , he has bemoaned the seemingly endless ( and fruitless ) american involvement in afghanistan , yet presided over a troop increase there last year
trump 's transactional view of things also tends to dominate his thinking
he reiterated this week that arab countries such as saudi arabia should compensate the united states for its military presence in the region , as if u.s. troops were almost mercenaries for hire
on wednesday , though , it seemed that trump had made a clear decision after a meeting with top officials in his administration
a white house statement confirmed that the military mission
in syria is coming to a rapid end , with isis being almost completely destroyed.
it added that the united states and its allies would remain committed to eliminating the small isis presence in syria that our forces have not already eradicated.
but it left the matter of building peace in the country in the hands of other actors we expect countries in the region and beyond , plus the united nations , to work toward peace and ensure that isis never re-emerge.
adding that there is a military role in this.
these difficult issues include the dizzying complexity of bringing the broader war in syria to an end
on wednesday , the leaders of turkey , russia and iran met in ankara in the latest round of talks over syria 's future
turkey , once a vociferous opponent of syrian president bashar al-assad , has seen the tide of the war tilt against its interests and is trying to find common cause with assad 's chief patrons
the turks are also furious over continued u.s. support to syrian kurdish factions operating along their border
given the tough realities of the syrian war , trump ca n't be blamed for wanting to extract the united states from the country once the islamic state has been pronounced dead
but a host of trump allies including the cast of the morning news show fox and friends and the saudi crown prince have urged trump to be patient and resolute
the washington foreign-policy establishment is also wary of quitting the fight too soon
bloomberg view 's neoconservative columnist eli lake echoed that fear over ceding further ground to iran but added that the best reason to stay in syria was humanitarian.
but trump is unlikely to be moved by such considerations
last week , his administration reportedly froze about $ 200 million in recovery funds earmarked for syria , money that is desperately needed
in raqqa , the former de facto capital of the islamic state , about 80 percent of the city lies in ruins thanks largely to a relentless bombing campaign authorized by the white house
the full extent of the civilian death toll is not yet known , but aid workers talk of the smell of decomposing corpses rising from the rubble
they pulled out more than 300 bodies between february and march , but there are worries of the spread of disease as summer draws near
