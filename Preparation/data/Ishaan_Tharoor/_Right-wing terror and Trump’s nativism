at what point can an ideology be blamed for violence
after a horrific mass shooting at a pittsburgh synagogue on saturday , president trumps supporters seemed to say never
they denied any link between the white houses persistent , polarizing rhetoric and the slaughter that took place
they scoffed at claims that trumps demagoguery replete with white-nationalist themes that critics have long cited as anti-semitic in effect , if not intent played a role in what was the most deadly act of anti-semitic violence in american history
the gunman in pittsburgh , suspected to be 46-year-old robert d. bowers , was apparently driven by an intense hatred of jews and what he believed was their supposed role in destroying american society
his last message on a website popular among the far right accused liberal jews of enabling caravans of migrant invaders to enter the united states.
i cant sit by and watch my people get slaughtered , bowers is believed to have written just hours before he allegedly went on his murderous rampage

the issue that allegedly drove bowers to mass murder is one that trump has turned into national news
trump , his party and their allies in right-wing media framed a caravan of central american migrants as an invading army
though the group is weeks away from the u.s. border and unlikely to actually cross it it was cast as the most urgent threat to american security
trump said the group was providing cover for dangerous middle easterners , scapegoating two sets of minorities at once
right-wing commentators accused liberals , including jewish american financier george soros , of funding the enterprise to flood the country with illegal voters the same multilayered , ultranationalist fever dream that terrified bowers
cecillia wang , deputy legal director at the american civil liberties union , told the washington post
set against this illiberal international are political parties and civil society groups that defend the values of a pluralist , inclusive society , including a number of influential jewish american organizations
in his alleged social media post , bowers singled out hias an organization that for decades helped resettle jewish refugees and now advocates for non-jewish refugees as a menace
three years ago , as trumps campaign picked up steam on a platform to bar syrian refugees from the united states , hias organized a petition signed by more than 1,000 american rabbis standing up for refugee rights
it is that belief in a common humanity that trump and his allies seem to reject
