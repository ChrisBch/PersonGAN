then he came for the steel and aluminum
president trumps pledge to slap new tariffs on the vital manufacturing commodities roiled global markets and u.s. politics this week
it led to the resignation of his top economic adviser , gary cohn , and prompted frantic appeals to reconsider from within the ranks of the presidents own party
but the president was hellbent on following through on one of his major campaign promises
and at a white house photo op thursday , alongside senior administration officials and a coterie of steel and aluminum workers , trump officially enacted a 10 percent tariff on aluminum and 25 percent tariff on steel imported into the united states
he framed the move as essential to restoring american national security and industry and bringing new jobs and factories to the united states although many economists arent so sure thats what will happen
trump also gave a temporary exemptions to canada and mexico , hoping not to rock the boat while the white house continues negotiations over amending the north american free trade agreement
what follows is going to be messy
the tariffs take effect in two weeks , and members of congress may try to block them before then
across the pond , top european union officials have threatened to retaliate with tariffs on u.s. goods ranging from steel to blue jeans , targeting products that will create maximum discomfort in washington
europe must show its power and sovereignty , french foreign minister jean-yves le drian told a french broadcaster
tariffs might be attractive for the united states now , but in the long term it will have detrimental effects on americans worldwide influence
we will defend our interests if necessary , e.u
foreign policy chief federica mogherini said in brussels
protectionism is not a good idea for the u.s. economy
many republicans in washington , long accustomed to championing free trade , concurred
some frantically tried to deter trump ahead of his thursday announcement
i have been placing calls over to the white house , sen. joni ernst ( r-iowa ) said in a radio interview
i was able to visit with some folks in the vice presidents office wednesday night
so i have not been able to speak directly to the president
i think theres a lot of calls going to him right now from a number of congressmen , senators , that are displeased about the policy
this needs to be well thought through , and i think it just came out of the blue
but trumps move shouldnt be much of a surprise
trump has touted protectionist economic measures for decades , and his campaign-trail diatribes were loaded with attacks against free trade and the false song of globalism
that word globalism became a political bugbear for trump , a catchall term to describe the perils of interdependence and immigration
his ultranationalist lieutenants , including departed chief strategist stephen k. bannon and others still within the administration , routinely labeled opponents as globalists
after news of cohns upcoming resignation broke this week , his rivals in the white house texted reporters gleeful messages using a globe emoji as shorthand for the former goldman sachs banker
a text from a wh official rip
another text from another wh official
even as the white house lavished parting praise on cohn , globalist appeared again and again
hes been terrific , trump said at a cabinet meeting thursday morning
he may be a globalist , but i still like him
mick mulvaney , director of both the white house 's office of management and budget and the consumer financial protection bureau , tweeted a similar remark earlier in the week
thanks to its frequent invocation by trump , his officials and his allies , the epithet has even crept largely unchallenged into the mainstream media as a kind of shorthand
.mickmulvaneyomb 's statement on the departure of gary cohn
of course , cohn does not self-identify as a globalist nor , really , does anyone else
the term is arguably an anti-semitic dog whistle , recently made popular by far-right media outlets such as breitbart news but harking back to days when some in europe spoke of jews as rootless cosmopolitans and enemies of the national interest
nevertheless , trumps embrace of such messaging has played out well among his populist base
anti-globalism is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the right , brian levin , director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university , said to the new york times in 2016
globalism is the defining folklore and narrative for the racist right , he added , and it has become a convenient boogeyman to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be in
trump 's embrace of that narrative also marks a fascinating rupture with the establishment wing of his own party
while mainstream gop officials seemed to tolerate other occasions when trump waved the flag of the far right from his demonization of muslim immigrants to his apparent coddling of neo-nazis the tariffs could prove a red line
house speaker paul d. ryan ( r-wis. ) urged trump to narrow the scope of punitive measures even further
sen. jeff flake ( r.-ariz. ) , an outspoken trump critic , promised to draft legislation to nullify the tariffs
but as cohn exits , power is flowing to protectionists like trump trade adviser peter navarro , a once-fringe trade-war advocate drafted into the white house after the presidents son-in-law encountered his anti-china writing on amazon
navarro and the president may be biting off more they can chew or at least more than what the rest of the world and washington may be willing to swallow
an editorial in the financial times laid out what may come next there is good reason to worry that this is merely an opening salvo and that next in line is china
mr trump has already threatened to penalize beijing for the alleged theft of us intellectual property rights , and is due to receive the results of a related investigation soon
mr trump has legitimate complaints about chinas trade policies
but he has given little cause for us to believe his response will be proportionate and effective
