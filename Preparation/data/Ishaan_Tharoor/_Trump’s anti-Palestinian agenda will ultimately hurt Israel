relief and works agency , or unrwa , has tended to the needs of palestinian refugees for nearly seven decades
but if president trump has his way , it will soon be out of business
on friday , his administration said it would cease funding the u.n. agency , which was launched in 1949 to provide for more than 700,000 palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes in what is now israel
relying on volunteer donors of which washington has been the largest unrwa has had its mandate renewed repeatedly by the u.n. general assembly as the israeli-palestinian conflict has dragged on
over the decades , the population of palestinian refugees in the occupied territories and now-semi-permanent camps in jordan , syria and lebanon has ballooned to around 5 million , encompassing the descendants of the original exiles
the white house , along with israel 's right wing , argues that the rolls of recognized refugees should be limited to those alive in 1949 a move at odds with other u.n. operations that also confer refugee status upon the descendants of the displaced
at a conference in washington last week , nikki haley , trump 's envoy to the united nations , bemoaned the endless number of refugees that continue to get assistance and how the palestinians continue to bash america
i welcome the us decision to stop funding unrwa
aside from providing cover to terror , unrwa is responsible for the fact that the 750,000 people they registered originally ( most of whom have since died ) became 5.5 million fake refugees
unrwa lost sight of its purpose long ago
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and many other leading israeli politicians cheered trump 's decision
meanwhile , unrwa officials are scrambling to raise funds from the european union and arab countries , adamant that their mission is necessary until a meaningful peace is achieved
pierre krhenbhl , unrwa 's commissioner general , said to the washington post 's ruth eglash
the move against unrwa is only the latest blow to palestinians delivered by trump
the trump administration 's approach has alienated the already enfeebled palestinian authority , led by mahmoud abbas , who is the key interlocutor in any peace deal with israel
according to reports , abbas claimed that trump envoys have even floated the prospect of a joint palestinian-jordanian confederation rather than palestinian independence
this may have disastrous short-term consequences for palestinians dependent on unrwa assistance
trump 's move surprised israels security establishment , which fears a humanitarian crisis
those concerns are shared by many in washington
further impoverishing palestinians only empowers extremists , undermines the p.a
and harms israels security
completely cutting off funding to unrwa is inhumane and undermines our own interests in the region
but there are long-term dangers for israel as well
netanyahu has embraced an ever more strident nationalism , pushing through a controversial national-identity law that undercuts minority rights
abroad , he flirts with authoritarian leaders willing to back israel in international forums even if they have track records of anti-semitism
he has , moreover , assiduously sought to shift focus away from peace with the palestinians to the threat of iran
in that project , he has presided over a warming in relations with arab countries such as egypt , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates
all of this has made netanyahu dominant in israeli politics , but it has fueled growing anger abroad
as trump and netanyahu seemingly pile more dirt on the coffin of the two-state solution , comparisons to apartheid-era south africa have become more common
the boycott , divestment and sanctions movement , which urges foreign governments and corporations to boycott israel as long as it maintains its occupation over palestinians , has become an increasingly important factor in the politics of peace
and as bipartisan support for israel fades in the united states , netanyahu 's right-wing stances leave israel more vulnerable to censure
the alliance between israels allies and ultra-nationalists in europe and the us has become a central theme of the bds campaigns messages
in this respect , the trump era has been good for the movement , nathan thrall , an expert on israeli-palestinian politics , wrote in the guardian.
so has the netanyahu government , whose attacks on bds have been among the greatest drivers of publicity and recruitment for the campaign
the weak crumble , are slaughtered and are erased from history while the strong , for good or for ill , survive
the strong are respected , and alliances are made with the strong , and in the end peace is made with the strong
if this worries the israeli prime minister , he is n't showing it
in a speech last week , netanyahu eschewed his countrys ostensibly liberal values and offered a chilling argument that might makes right
in the middle east , he said , there is no place for the weak.
and the palestinians , it can be inferred , ought to know their place
