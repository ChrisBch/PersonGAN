on sunday , turkish president recep tayyip erdogan crowed that turkish troops and their rebel allies had liberated the northern syrian city of afrin and were in total control of its environs
after two months of grinding warfare , they had driven out fighters belonging to the ypg , a faction of syrian kurds loathed by ankara because of its links to an outlawed terrorist group operating on turkish soil
but the fall of afrin does offer a particularly gloomy snapshot of washington 's confused role in the syrian war
both the trump and obama administrations courted the ypg and backed their fight against the islamic state much to the chagrin of turkey
the ypg is the most important fighting force within a coalition known as the syrian democratic forces , or sdf , which led the anti-jihadist fight in eastern and northeastern syria and helped drive the islamic state from its de facto capital , raqqa
the group has won bipartisan sympathy on capitol hill and is celebrated by some columnists and public intellectuals in the west as a secular , liberal outfit operating in a world of reactionaries and extremists
( critics point to the ypg 's own alleged abuses and crimes )
meanwhile , turkey views such moves as tacit support for a de facto kurdish state on its borders , and that disagreement has helped fuel the decline of u.s.-turkey relations over the past half-decade
when operation olive branch turkey 's orwellian name for its campaign in afrin got underway , the united states had little influence to wield with ankara in trying to stop it
the entreaties from president trump urging turkey to de-escalate went unheeded
turkey , once violently at odds with russia , even won moscow 's cooperation before launching its offensive
so when the going got tough , the kurds in afrin like their ethnic brethren at other moments in the history of the middle east realized they were alone
reports suggested that even as trump denounced the turkish offensive , administration officials were indicating to ankara that the united states would be reconsidering its support for the ypg
nicholas heras of the washington-based center for a new american security said to my colleague liz sly in late january.
this is shoot-from-the-hip policymaking.
hassan hassan , a senior fellow at the tahrir institute for middle east policy , said to today 's worldview
hassan argued that the united states could have headed off this latest crisis by more delicately handling turkish grievances
but that would require a deftness and coherence of vision that the white house demonstrably lacks , particularly when it comes to syria
as my colleagues reported , there are vast divides within the trump administration over the american commitment to the war effort
the washington post 's paul sonne and karen deyoung wrote.
a second senior administration official , however , completely rejected the notion that assad is winning , saying the regime is 'weaker than it has ever been , certainly in this half of the civil war
