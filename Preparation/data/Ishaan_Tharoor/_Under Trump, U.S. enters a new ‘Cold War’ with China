the trump administration is throwing down the gauntlet in front of china
it has already launched the first major salvos of a trade war
it approved a $ 330 million arms sale to taiwan last month
and now its top officials are taking part in a rhetorical offensive against beijing that shows few signs of abating
in a speech last week at a conservative think tank , vice president pence called for a reset in u.s.-china ties
he attacked china for its alleged hacking and espionage attempts within the united states , its theft of u.s. technological secrets , its supposedly unfair trade practices , its bullying diplomacy abroad and its crackdown on the rights of ethnic and religious minorities at home
pence argued that the white house now sees beijing as a rival in an age of great power competition a marked departure from previous administrations , which hoped to accommodate a rising china as a responsible stakeholder in the international system
my colleague josh rogin observed
this new china policy , which marries economic nationalism with brute hawkishness , would have been unthinkable coming from the obama administration , he wrote
vp pence on beijings increasing religious persecution
read his delivered remarks
my colleagues reported
zhang baohui , professor of international relations at lingnan university in hong kong , told the new york times
indeed , beijing has reacted frostily so far
after swinging through the korean peninsula over the weekend , secretary of state mike pompeo had a brief , combative stay in the chinese capital.
we demand the u.s. stop such misguided actions , chinese foreign minister wang yi said at a news conference , referring to washingtons harsh words as well as to the trade tensions that have cast a shadow over relations
apple ceo tim cook tried to pay for the ferry ticket using his apple watch 4 in shanghai , but failed multiple times - by placing the apple watch on the scanner for wechat qr codes
prominent members of the american business community including apple ceo tim cook , who visited china this week lament the tense climate
but they do not have many sympathizers in the administration , which seems enthused by the prospect of an epic clash with a geopolitical adversary
