as we reported this week , a dispute over turkeys continued detention of an american clergyman has spiraled into the worst crisis between the two countries in more than four decades
president trump has exultantly slapped tariffs on turkish imports , an act that sent the countrys currency into a tailspin over the weekend
now turkey has retaliated , announcing on wednesday that it would levy its own tariffs on a slate of u.s. products
the increasingly nasty fight between two nato allies is bad enough , but a potentially bigger crisis looms in neighboring iraq , which is feeling the effects of trumps attempts to squeeze iran
iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi reluctantly admitted last week that iraq had no choice but to abide by the terms of renewed sanctions imposed on iran by the trump administration
reports suggest that the united states would sanction any iraqi bank that runs afoul of american prohibitions on doing business with the islamic republic
we dont sympathize with the sanctions , we dont think they are appropriate but we are committed to protect our people , abadi said
but a two-pronged backlash not only were some iraqis angered , but the iranians apparently canceled a meeting with the iraqi prime minister scheduled for this week prompted abadi to change tack
one could say trumps iran policy is already working
tension between iran & iraq is the highest in over a decade , due to baghdads compliance with the re-imposed sanctions
iran accuses iraq of betrayal
iraqi pm cancels trip to tehran
add anti-iran chants at southern protests
abadi is at the helm of a caretaker government , with iraqi politicians still grappling over the makeup of a new ruling coalition for the country
he is in an unenviably delicate position though he is liked in washington , he is also beholden to irans interests and influence inside his country and its constellation of political parties
he can afford neither a rupture with the united states , a critical security partner , nor a real fight with tehran , with which it does some $ 12 billion worth of annual trade and shares myriad other connections
things may get even trickier in november , when a tougher round of u.s. sanctions on irans oil industry is slated to take effect
nabil jafar , a professor of economics at the university of basra , told al-monitor that iraq might be denied exporting its oil if baghdad doesnt comply with those measures
but genevieve abdo , a resident scholar of the arabia foundation in washington , argued in politico that iraq has no choice but to violate the sanctions
if iraq adhered to the trump administrations demands , iran could cut off desperately needed resources to its neighbor
iraqs chronic electricity shortages would become exponentially worse if its supplies of iranian natural gas dried up its droughts would be far more severe if iran diverted flows of water into away from rivers
for trump and his allies , though , thats iraqs problem
the white house is bent on pushing back iranian influence across the middle east and hobbling the theocratic regime in tehran
critics argue its an overzealous mission that both obscures potential avenues for cooperation not least in iraq , where both iran and the united states worked to defeat the islamic state and overstates the scale of the iranian threat
tehrans military budget is smaller than those of israel , the united arab emirates and saudi arabia three traditional u.s. allies in the region who are vehement foes of iran
iran is playing with fire - they do n't appreciate how kind president obama was to them
meanwhile , ordinary people are suffering while foreign powers play their games
the precipitous decline of the iranian rial , sparked by trumps unraveling of the nuclear deal , has had unintended consequences in countries nearby
and as my colleagues reported , countless iraqis who had invested their savings in schemes offered by iranian banks are seeing their money rapidly dwindle
these investments were mostly made a few years ago , when the situation across the border seemed far more stable than in iraq , where the islamic state was overrunning whole cities
now , what seemed a safer bet has turned into a new source of misery
hussain al-kaabi , a 41-year-old real estate investor who spoke to my colleagues , estimated that the current turmoil has set him back a decade
