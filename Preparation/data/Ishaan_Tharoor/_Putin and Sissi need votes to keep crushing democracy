ahead of presidential elections in russia and egypt this month russias on sunday , egypts in two weeks its tough to choose which will be more of a farce
theres no doubt over either outcome the incumbent leaders of both countries president vladimir putin of russia and president abdel fatah al-sissi of egypt will win
they both rule as autocratic strongmen , styling themselves as fathers of the nation
both have seized upon their races as platforms for their legitimacy but have ensured theres no possible way they could lose
their allies boast of their soaring popularity even as their critics remain largely muzzled , imprisoned , exiled or otherwise subdued
any genuine opponents who could challenge sissi have been sidelined , detained or disqualified from running
mousa moustafa mousa , the token rival candidate , was reportedly collecting signatures supporting sissis reelection up until january
and the field squaring off against putin includes loyalists , hard line nationalists and even a youthful reality-tv host who is rumored to be putins own goddaughter
but in both these nominal democracies , the show must go on
both leaders see these votes as affirmations of their popularity and therefore hope for high turnouts in their favor
at an event in january , with opponents calling for boycotts , sissi even cast those who refused to vote as potential threats to national security
so putin has invested much effort in at least playing the part of a candidate , attending rallies across the country with the support of patriotic pop stars and flag-waving crowds
in some areas of russia , voters are being enticed to come to the polls sunday with promotions offering everything from free cancer screenings to contests to win new iphones
indeed , both putin and sissi seem bent on tightening their already white-knuckled grip on power
in a 2013 military coup , sissi toppled his countrys only democratically elected president , the muslim brotherhoods mohamed morsi
sissi then won 97 percent of the vote in a 2014 election staged after the brutal suppression of the brotherhood and other dissidents
meanwhile , the 2012 election that returned putin to the presidency was shrouded in allegations of voter fraud and irregularities , though the protests they sparked in moscow did not stick
sissi , who has been in power for far less time than putin , has much to fear if turnout is low
like other countries in the middle east , egypt is struggling to reckon with stuttering economic growth and soaring youth unemployment
some analysts warn of an inevitable social explosion
and so sissis government has taken extraordinary measures to crack down on opposition voices in the run-up to the vote , taking prominent tv journalists off the air and working to stifle criticism on social media
this week , egyptian authorities published a series of phone numbers to which citizens could report on media outlets believed to be circulating supposed fake news or harming the national interest
