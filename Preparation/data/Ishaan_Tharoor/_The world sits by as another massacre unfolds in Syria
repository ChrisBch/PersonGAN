death is raining down on eastern ghouta
the suburban district outside damascus is one of the last remaining rebel enclaves near the syrian capital
it 's been under siege for half a decade , battered by bombs and stalked by starvation
the last humanitarian convoy to arrive was in november
and now it is under relentless attack
as my colleagues reported , airstrikes carried out by the syrian regime and its russian allies have pummeled eastern ghouta since sunday , with circling squadrons of jets , drones and helicopters hitting hospitals , schools and residential buildings
many of the approximately 400,000 people still trapped in the rebel-held area are cowering in basements
numerous medical facilities were destroyed , with doctors telling media that they now are resorting to using expired drugs to treat the many wounded
according to human rights monitors and aid agencies , the strikes have killed more than 300 people in the space of a few days and injured hundreds more
eastern ghouta , it should not be forgotten , was hit in 2013 by a regime chemical-weapons strike that allegedly killed hundreds
but the current moment is potentially even more terrifying
a hospital director in eastern ghouta told cnn.
but we have never seen anything like this escalation.
( on wednesday , a new round of airstrikes killed at least 45 people , according to local activists )
the violence has elicited the usual international denunciations and fits of hand-wringing
western columnists likened the killings to the war crimes at srebrenica editorials lamented the chronic impotence of institutions such as the united nations
guterres said , adding , i believe eastern ghouta can not wait.
but it certainly will
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov shrugged off calls for a truce wednesday , saying that the fight against terrorism can not be restricted by anything.
authorities in damascus played down the suffering of their countrymen , claiming that rebel groups were using civilians as human shields.
indeed , this may be only the beginning of a more intense onslaught against east ghouta as the regime of president bashar al-assad prepares a final offensive
in the past week , ground reinforcements have been massing along the outskirts of the suburb under the command of one of assad 's top generals
the regime views the islamist rebel groups occupying the enclave as terrorists
sana , the syrian state news agency , said dozens of rockets and mortar rounds fired in the past two days by these factions hit various neighborhoods in damascus , killing more than a dozen people
the scenario is similar to the regime 's slow , destructive reconquest in 2016 of rebel-held areas in aleppo
at the time , both syrian and russian officials hailed the liberation of the city from islamist radicals and trumpeted their efforts to evacuate civilians and deliver humanitarian aid
but then , as now , footage and photos from inside the besieged areas told a different story of neighborhoods laid to waste , whole families wiped out , and wounded children , rescued from the rubble , sitting mute and alone
osama nasser , a veteran anti-government activist , asked my colleagues
for now , the focus remains on the desperate struggle for survival of those caught in the crossfire
even that anxiety alone can have devastating effects
aid groups point to spiraling rates of depression and even suicide among children and young adults trapped in the area
