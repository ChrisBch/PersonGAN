it 's an end of an era in havana
on wednesday , cuba 's national assembly convened a session that will culminate in president ral castro stepping down from his post in favor of his first vice president , miguel diaz-canel
the move sets the stage for a startling reality diaz-canel will become the first non-castro to lead the caribbean nation since marxist revolutionaries swept to power almost six decades ago
castro , 86 , will remain head of the country 's communist party , although he is in the twilight of his career
his brother fidel castro , architect of the regime that has withstood decades of american blockade , stepped down in his favor in 2008 and died two years ago
and while the ascension of diaz-canel a handpicked successor plucked from the ranks of the communist leadership has been telegraphed for months , it still presents a dramatic inflection point
that 's a line of argument shared by many republicans in washington and hawks in the trump administration
in the space of a year , president trump has set about reversing the landmark steps toward normalization with cuba that president barack obama had set in motion
obama had visited cuba in 2016 and delivered a speech watched by millions
he was followed by myriad u.s. politicians , fashion icons , wall street ceos and business executives , and thousands of tourists whose arrival all buoyed cuba 's fledgling private sector
but after a mysterious set of health attacks on u.s. diplomats , trump moved to expel cuban diplomats and withdraw the bulk of u.s. staff in havana
his administration has also stemmed the flow of american tourists heading to cuba , limited american investment there and intensified rhetoric against the regime
what hopeful talk there had been of a new chapter in u.s.-cuba relations was snuffed out as trump who only a few years prior seemed interested in expanding his businesses to cuba pandered to a vocal but small constituency within his own party
the cuba skeptics claim that obama 's opening did little to change the behavior of the oppressive cuban regime , but their critics argue that progress would be slow and fitful and that the u.s. hawks cling to an anachronistic cold war mind-set
after all , the united states has few qualms building economic and political ties with vietnam , another communist-ruled one-party state that squeezes civil society and jails dissidents
diaz-canel , 57 , is from a generation of cuban politicos who never manned the guerrilla front lines alongside fidel , che guevara or other figures from the halcyon days of revolution
instead , he cut his political teeth in the 1990s as cuba reckoned with the economic catastrophe that followed the collapse of the soviet union
he is seen as something of a pragmatist and a proponent of new technology
but his assumption of the presidency is also a mark of his closeness to the prevailing order
diaz-canel faces pressure to bolster cuba 's flagging economy , which can no longer count on being buttressed by venezuela 's petro-wealth
he may have to spearhead monetary reform and push for further foreign investment , calibrating the imperative for loosening up against the fears of the communist establishment
other foreign powers most notably china and russia have stepped in , restructuring or forgiving tens of billions of dollars in cuban debt , while investing in various sectors of the cuban economy
china is cuba 's biggest trading partner , accounting for $ 1.8 billion in exports to the island in 2017 , according to jimenez
in the same year , russian exports to cuba , including shipments of oil , increased by 81 percent
