for many observers in brussels and washington , the political news from eastern and central europe is now often a source of worry
in hungary and poland , illiberal nationalist governments are in firm control of the levers of power , steadily eroding democratic norms and squeezing civil society
in austria , the far right is the junior partner in a ruling coalition
in the czech republic and slovakia , populist nationalism has carried the day , with politicians in both countries scaremongering over islam and refugees
but developments in slovakia over the past month offer a rare bit of optimism
in recent weeks , the country has witnessed its largest protests since the velvet revolution of 1989 when mass demonstrations throughout what was once czechoslovakia led to the fall of its communist regime , and the resignation of its prime minister
on feb. 25 , authorities found the bodies of jan kuciak , an investigative journalist , and his fiancee , martina kusnirova , a trained archaeologist
both were 27 years old with a wedding scheduled for may and promising futures ahead of them
though no one has yet been charged with the murders , government prosecutors believe it was a contract killing
attention immediately fell on kuciak 's work
he had been digging into the connections between italian mafia organizations and slovak oligarchs and government officials
the latter included prime minister robert fico , who had served three terms in power since 2006
though the public has long been accustomed to graft and cronyism among slovakia 's political elites , news of kuciak 's deaths sparked a fire
jan kuciak murder slovak pm makes cash reward appeal posing next to a million euros in cash , robert fico asked for information about jan kuciak 's murder
people felt that criminal elements in slovak society were now able to operate with impunity , wrote nicolette makovicky , a lecturer at oxford university
their ire was deepened by an unseemly response from fico , who dodged questions about kuciak 's reporting and offered a literal stack of cash worth $ 1.2 million as a reward for information into the murder
then , as public anger grew , he embraced the regional custom of blaming everything on jewish american financier george soros
mass protests soon sprung up , widening the divisions within fico 's ruling coalition
he eventually stepped down on march 15 , bowing to a dramatic display of people power
from china to russia to turkey and , president trumps critics would say , even in the united states political currents have swung toward consolidated power , nationalist messaging and intolerance for competing voices
said juraj seliga , a 27-year-old law student who was among the protest organizers.
fico was so strong
now hes weak.
but fico remains the head of his party , and the new prime minister is his former deputy
this week , the ruling coalition survived a confidence vote in parliament and is still holding firm despite calls for fresh elections
fico could still end up in a situation where he is ensconced in power as the hand behind the throne
but even elections may not deliver the results the slovakia 's liberals desire
even if slovaks were to successfully force the early fall of the current governing coalition , they face a stark choice , wrote makovicky
the liberal political opposition is small and fragmented
the latest opinion polls also show that the crisis has pushed more voters towards support for parties with strong nationalist , right-wing orientations
in the past , fico has declared that islam has no place in slovakia , said multiculturalism is a fiction and decried the political correctness supposedly insulating his country 's roma minority
yet , ironically , he has served as a moderate social-democratic bulwark against the more radical politicians to his right
while his ouster may have been a victory for those campaigning against corruption and for accountability , experts warn that slovakia now could drift in the direction of poland or hungary
it is worth remembering that the center collapsed in hungary and poland after scandals that now seem relatively minor , especially when compared with the czech and slovak news stories of colossal conflicts of interest and mafia connections
unless political classes in both countries change their ways and do so very quickly the time will soon be ripe for an ugly , illiberal turn in the heart of europe
but seliga , one of the protest organizers , specifically told witte that slovaks did not want to end up like hungary
said jozef batora , a political-science professor in bratislava , told the christian science monitor.
it is time to be a normal society.
