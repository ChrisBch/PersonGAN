anthony mele had just finished his dinner at a seaside california restaurant when a stranger walked toward the table he was sharing with his family
as meles 5-year-old daughter sat on her fathers lap , the stranger , for reasons still unknown , stabbed mele in the neck , the ventura police department said
the girl was not injured , but mele died the next day
several 911 calls about the stabbing just before 9:30 p.m. wednesday sent police officers to aloha steakhouse in ventura , northwest of los angeles
a group of people had chased the suspect , a homeless man , out of the restaurant and toward the beach by the time officers arrived , police said
jamal jackson , 49 , was arrested and charged with murder
mele , 35 , was removed from life support about 6:30 p.m. thursday

police said the two men did not know each other , and the motive for what appeared to be an unprovoked attack is under investigation
jackson had been in the area near the restaurant hours before the stabbing
police said a bystander had called 911 about a man , later identified as jackson , yelling and being disruptive
but patrol officers were unavailable to respond at that time , so staffers at the police departments command center watched jacksons movements through the piers security camera
several minutes later , the command center staff determined that jackson was not disturbing or threatening anyone , police said

a 30-minute surveillance video shows jackson sitting on a guardrail
halfway through the video , he waved at two people , a man and a woman , and asked them for cigarettes
the man gave jackson a cigarette and handed him a lighter , and the three appeared to speak briefly while jackson smoked
at one point , the two asked jackson to take a picture of them
they left after about two minutes
police said investigators want to speak with the people who had interacted with jackson
investigators did not say what type of weapon was used to stab mele , or where and how jackson may have obtained it
aloha steakhouse is near ventura promenade , an oceanfront trail that runs parallel to the beach
police said they have increased patrols along the promenade
onlookers stood outside the restaurant , where a memorial of candles , flowers and pictures had been created
a gofundme page to help meles family had raised more than $ 75,000 as of sunday morning

meles death is venturas first homicide this year , police cmdr
tom higgins told the ventura county star
jackson is being held on a $ 1.05 million bond , with a court hearing scheduled next week
it was not immediately clear whether he has an attorney
