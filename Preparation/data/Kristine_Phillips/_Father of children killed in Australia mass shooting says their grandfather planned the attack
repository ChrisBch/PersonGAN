the deadly incident was australias worst mass shooting since the 1996 port arthur massacre , when a gunman opened fire in a cafe in tasmania and then hunted down more victims in his vehicle , killing 35 and injuring many
soon after the 1996 incident , john howard , who was elected as australias prime minister that year , enacted strict gun control
known as the 1996 national firearms agreement ( nfa ) , the law banned the possession , manufacture and sale of all semiautomatic firearms and pump-action shotguns other than in exceptional circumstances , such as military and police use
its just horrifying seven killed in australias deadliest mass shooting in 22 years
the nfa , one of the most stringent gun laws in the world , also mandated that applicants wait 28 days from the time they obtain a permit to the time they buy a weapon
applicants are also required to undergo firearms training , and weapons and ammunition must be stored separately , according to the law
in 2016 , a research published in the journal of the american medical association showed that australia had not had a mass shooting since the changes and that suicide rates in the country had been on the decline , the posts christopher ingraham reported
ingraham noted , however , that there were no significant changes in gun-related homicides
a 2016 investigation by the age , an australian newspaper , found that gun-related crimes in melbourne had doubled over the past five years
mark mcgowan , the premier of western australia , called the deaths of the seven people one of the worst tragedies that part of the country has been confronted with
mcgowan told reporters that he does not believe the government should take action on gun control after the shooting
he said , the australian broadcasting corp. reported
he said officials will wait for the coroners report to determine what legislative steps , if any , should be taken
