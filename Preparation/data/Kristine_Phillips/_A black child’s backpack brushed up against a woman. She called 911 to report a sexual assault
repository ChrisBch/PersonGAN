a new york woman became the subject of ridicule and hatred on social media after she falsely accused a boy of groping her while she was shopping inside a deli
teresa klein , who is white , created a commotion earlier last week outside the sahara deli market in brooklyns flatbush neighborhood as she appeared to tell a 911 dispatcher that the boy , who is black , assaulted her
the spectacle was captured in a now-viral video , and klein , a 53-year-old brooklyn resident , has been nicknamed cornerstorecaroline
no , i want the cops here right now , klein said as she held her phone to her ear and a crowd of angry onlookers began to gather around
the boy , wearing a tucked-in green shirt and carrying a backpack , began to cry as the woman in aviator glasses and knee-high boots accused him of grabbing her
the crowd grew angrier , screaming at klein , who had covered her other ear as she continued to talk to the 911 operator
i just was sexually assaulted by a child , klein said
are you seriously calling the police
a woman can be heard saying
a black lawmaker was canvassing door to door in her district
a constituent called 911
new york resident jason littlejohn recorded the wednesday incident and shared it on facebook , where it has since been viewed millions of times
the incident comes amid several controversies involving black or brown people who have found themselves the subjects of 911 calls
such false-alarm emergency calls over non-emergency incidents , many of which have been captured on video , have raised questions about whether these calls had less to do with what someone was doing than with the persons race
on friday , klein went back to the store , where reporters surrounded her
later , klein , the reporters and several onlookers , many with phones held up , crowded inside the small deli , where surveillance footage of the alleged grabbing was being played on a screen mounted on a wall
the video showed klein standing at the register as the boy walked past behind her with his blue backpack and a plastic bag in his right hand
as the boys bag appeared to brush against klein , she looked behind her , seeming startled
another facebook video , also uploaded by littlejohn , showed klein watching the surveillance footage
onlookers screamed at klein and called her a liar after the footage revealed she was wrong
but klein seemed oblivious and spoke only to the reporters , who asked her what she thought after watching the footage
the child accidentally brushed against me , she acknowledged
looking into one of the tv cameras , she apologized to the boy.
young man , i dont know your name , but im sorry.
you know why the lady called the police black people face 911 calls for innocuous acts
the washington post was unable to reach klein
a number she was heard giving to the dispatcher during her 911 call is no longer in service
she told fox affiliate wnyw that she is not racist , and that she called 911 because the boys mother had become aggressive toward her
new york police said the department did not receive any complaints or 911 calls coming from the delis address
on monday , the boy identified as 9-year-old jeremiah harvey attended a community meeting hosted by the brooklyn borough president , wabc reported
the station said the child rejected kleins earlier apology
i dont forgive this woman at all , and she needs help , said jeremiah
the boys mother said , according to wabc
there have been several incidents in the past year involving black people whose ordinary activities were viewed with suspicious lenses -- leading to the hashtag livingwhileblack
for a 12-year-old black boy in ohio , it was mowing the lawn
for an 8-year-old girl in california , it was selling water outside the apartment building where she lives
and for a pair of young black men in philadelphia , it was sitting inside a starbucks waiting for a person they were supposed to meet
for a black lawmaker in oregon , it was canvassing in her district
for a yale university graduate student , it was napping in one of the schools common rooms
for a group of black sorority girls in pennsylvania , it was picking up trash on a highway as part of a community-service effort
for former obama white house staffer darren martin , it was moving into his new manhattan apartment
martin is one of a group of black people who wrote to the house and senate judiciary committees last summer , asking for a hearing on racial profiling , the washington posts cleve r. wootson jr. reported
in september , new york state sen. jesse hamilton ( d-brooklyn ) held a town hall meeting called living while black
hamilton also had introduced legislation that would make falsely reporting an incident a hate crime
the bill remains in committee
