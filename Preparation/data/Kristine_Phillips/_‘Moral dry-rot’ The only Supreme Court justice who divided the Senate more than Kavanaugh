a harpers weekly cartoon shows a plump , middle-aged man sitting on one side of the supreme court bench , tipping its balance
with his right hand , he proudly holds a paper that says , by one vote a reference to the narrow margin by which he was installed to the high court
before brett m. kavanaugh , there was stanley matthews , whose confirmation was so fraught and divisive that it took a second nomination to cement his place on the supreme court
president rutherford b. hayes , matthewss old friend from his home state of ohio , selected him in 1881 , but his nomination languished in the senate judiciary committee without a vote
newly elected president james a. garfield promptly renominated matthews , and the senate confirmed him on a 24-23 vote the narrowest margin in the supreme courts history
one-hundred and thirty-seven years later , another divided senate would confirm kavanaugh on a 50-48 vote
the parallelism between the two judges contentious confirmation battles was first reported by the national constitution center , a philadelphia-based nonprofit museum about the constitution
the may 17 , 1881 , article said
matthewss career was deeply tangled in politics and the judiciary
born in lexington , ky. , he studied law in cincinnati and was admitted to the bar before he was 20
as a young lawyer , he espoused anti-slavery principles
but as a u.s. attorney 15 years later , he prosecuted a newspaper editor for helping runaway slaves
as a private attorney , he represented railroad tycoons and corporate interests
as a lieutenant colonel of the 23rd ohio volunteer infantry , he served under hayes , a college friend and future president with whom he was related by marriage
and as a friend to hayes , matthews was instrumental in his election to the presidency a win so highly disputed that the elements of the press dubbed hayes rutherfraud and his fraudulency.
these entanglements all complicated matthewss rise to the supreme court
defiant republicans hope kavanaugh fight will stoke their voters next month
critics said he was an opportunist who abandoned his anti-slavery principles for the sake of political expediency
they saw him as beholden to the railroad magnates who paid him handsomely as their lawyer
one of his former clients was jay gould , who controlled the largest railroad company in the country , according to the national constitution center
but perhaps matthewss most complicated entanglement was his personal and professional connection to hayes
the election of 1876 was one of the most contentious in history
hayess democratic opponent , new york gov
samuel tilden , won the popular vote by 250,000 and was one electoral college vote short of victory
but the results from three southern states florida , louisiana and south carolina were disputed , with both parties claiming to have won all three
congress created a bipartisan , 15-member electoral commission to resolve the dispute
and hayes tapped matthews to be one of the attorneys to argue on his behalf before the commission
the commission voted 8-to-7 to award the disputed 20 electoral college votes to hayes

federal troops were withdrawn , as promised , allowing the three southern states to control their own affairs , wrote nicholas e. hollis , who was director of the james wormley recognition project
this marked the end of reconstruction and paved the way for racial segregation and disenfranchisement of black voters in the south
that matthews , who once opposed slavery , was instrumental in this chain of events was noted by critics
toward the end of his term in 1881 , hayes nominated matthews for the supreme court , an action widely seen as improper patronage or even nepotism , according to the national constitution center
democrats , many of whom never stopped questioning the legitimacy of hayess presidency , were frustrated that republicans had been in control of the white house since the civil war
and hayes had already installed two supreme court justices
the senate judiciary committee refused to hear matthewss nomination
garfield , who succeeded hayes , resubmitted it and was sharply criticized
the paper said
with kavanaugh confirmed , impeachment could follow
the senate confirmed matthews on may 12 after a fierce debate
he was sworn in five days later
those who supported matthews southern senators described him as very accomplished and scholarly and argued he would be fair and honest in deciding political cases , according to the post article
matthews was regarded as one of the more progressive justices on the bench
in one of his most notable opinions , yick wo v. hopkins ( 1886 ) , matthews found that a san francisco ordinance regulating licensing of laundries discriminated against chinese laundry workers
he died of an illness in 1888 after serving for only seven years on the supreme court
