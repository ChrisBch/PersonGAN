kim reynolds on friday signed a bill that would prohibit abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected
it is one of the most restrictive laws of its kind in the united states and one that republicans hope will pave the way for a showdown at the u.s. supreme court
the heartbeat bill , which would ban abortions as early as six weeks around the time women generally feel early signs of pregnancy and before many realize they are pregnant was passed tuesday by the iowa house , 51-46
the state senate passed the bill 29-17 early wednesday , sending it to reynolds ( r ) , who has said abortion is equivalent to murder.
the law requires women seeking an abortion to first have an ultrasound , at which time a physician would detect whether there is a heartbeat
it also would prohibit someone from acquiring , providing , receiving , transferring or using a fetal body part in iowa
