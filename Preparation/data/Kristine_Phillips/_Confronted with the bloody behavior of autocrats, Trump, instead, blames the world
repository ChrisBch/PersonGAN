in fielding questions from reporters about the killing of washington post contributing columnist jamal khashoggi , president trump avoided blaming mohammed bin salman , despite the cias findings that the saudi crown prince had ordered the assassination
who should be held accountable
a reporter asked trump thursday
sitting inside his mar-a-lago resort in florida , the president took a deep breath , seemingly mulling his response
this line of thinking is not new for trump
when confronted with questions about allegations of murderous acts and abuse of power lodged against autocratic leaders , he has often brushed them aside , even in the face of overwhelming evidence
trump deflects by blaming other countries for also committing atrocious acts , or the united states for having a lot of killers.
he condemns the world , but not the powerful people accused of making it vicious in the first place
last year , former fox news host bill oreilly pressed trump about vladimir putin and accusations that the russian president and his associates have killed journalists and dissidents in russia
trump brushes aside cia assertion that crown prince ordered killing , defends him and saudi arabia
putin is a killer , oreilly said
but trump , who has refused to condemn putin despite findings by u.s. intelligence officials that russia interfered in the 2016 presidential elections , seemed unfazed
trump had a similar exchange with joe scarborough in 2015
he kills journalists that dont agree with him , the morning joe host said of putin
at least 34 journalists have been killed in russia since 2000 , according to politifact , which combined data from two nonprofits that chronicle such incidents
nina ognianova of the committee to protect journalistss europe and central asia program told politifact that journalists can be slain with impunity in putins russia , where killers feel emboldened to act by an administration that marginalizes journalists
she acknowledged that there has been no evidence linking putin to the deaths
harley balzer , a georgetown university professor who specializes in russian and eastern european studies , said that putin did not need to personally sign off on assassinations of kremlin critics
in his comments about khashoggis killing thursday , trump seemed to defer to what he described as mohammeds vehement denials of his involvement and contradicted the cias assessment that the direct order came from the crown prince himself
he also seemed to suggest that all u.s. allies were guilty of the same behavior
if others were held to the same standard to which critics are holding saudi arabia , we wouldnt be able to have anyone for an ally , trump told reporters
trump treasures being an ally of saudi arabia because of the countrys role in fighting iran , forging israeli-palestinian peace , defeating islamist terrorism and , as the president has said repeatedly , the economic growth this partnership promises
trumps dangerous message to tyrants flash money and get away with murder
he said last year , using another name for the islamic state
to put this all simply there may have been atrocious acts , but however much blood has been spilled , it is not worth sacrificing the partnership for
trump has praised other autocratic leaders , including north korean dictator kim jong un , whom the president declared to have developed a very special bond with after a summit in june
about a year before that , in april 2017 , trump told philippine president rodrigo duterte that hes doing an unbelievable job ridding the southeast asian country of its long-standing drug problem
thousands of filipinos have been killed since duterte launched his bloody war against drugs
