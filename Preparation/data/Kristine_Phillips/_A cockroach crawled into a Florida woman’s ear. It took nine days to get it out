katie holley was jolted awake by a cold thing what she had initially thought was a small piece of ice that somehow slid down her left ear
disoriented , she rushed to the bathroom , grabbed a cotton swab and slowly stuck it inside her ear
and then holley felt something move
it was like a rhythmic movement , she recalled , as if whatever that thing was was trying to burrow deeper into her ear canal
she pulled out the cotton swab and saw small , dark brown pieces that looked like legs
cockroaches have been a nuisance in the holley household since she and her husband , jordan , bought their first home last year , she wrote in self magazine this week
they thrive in warm and damp places , and that includes florida , where the young couple live and where cockroaches called palmetto bugs are most common
households in warm cities , such as new orleans , houston and atlanta , report more problems with cockroaches than much of the country
a few weeks earlier , an exterminator sprayed every room inside the couples house in melbourne , fla. , and holley felt what turned out to be a very temporary sense of relief
that morning of april 14 , around 1:45 a.m. , jordan holley rushed to the bathroom to help his panicking wife , grabbed a flashlight and looked inside her ear
and there it was , a small part still visible from the outside as it stayed there , lodged in the middle of the ear canal
jordan holley managed to pull out a couple of legs using a pair of tweezers , but the intrepid bug had crawled too deep
the young couple drove to the emergency room just a few miles away
a man sitting behind a desk near the hospitals entrance saw the look of panic in katie holleys face and asked whether she was in pain
she felt a crawling sensation
doctors found a live cockroach in her skull
holley said she told him
she was given a wristband and taken to a room , where she lay on her side on a gurney , whimpering
a nurse injected the bug with the anesthetic lidocaine to try to kill it
holley said she felt the roach move , twitching and wriggling further into her ear as it tried to avoid death
two minutes later , it stopped moving
it took the doctor about 20 seconds to pull out chunks of the dead roach , and holley saw what she thought was the remains of a small insect
she left the hospital nearly two hours later with a prescription for antibiotics and ear drops , relieved that it was all over
she and her husband vowed to never let the experience happen again , stopping by a walmart to buy earplugs
about a week passed , but holleys ear still didnt feel normal
it was still numb , she said , and she felt some discomfort every time she yawned
her medicine drops also had begun to leak out , leading her to think that perhaps earwax had built up inside
she went to her physician for her regularly scheduled appointment and asked the doctor whether she could check her ear
her doctor and a physician assistant flushed her ear four times
using an otoscope , they peeked inside , and there it was another leg
holleys doctor pulled out six pieces of the roachs remains but feared there was still more left
her physician arranged for her to see a doctor who specializes in treating ears , nose and throat ( ent ) later that day , holley said
white house occupants complain about stuck doors , roaches , mice and ants
while at home waiting for her appointment , she tried to remember how much of the roach was taken out at the emergency room more than a week earlier
the ent doctor placed what looked like a microscope next to holleys face
a few minutes later , she felt something bigger was getting extracted out of her ear canal
and then she saw it
not a teensy leg or two.
not the remains of a baby roach
but a head , a torso , limbs and long antennae of what looked like a fully grown palmetto bug
for nine days , much of the dead roach had sat in holleys ear
holley declined to name the hospital she first went to in april
luckily for her , palmetto bugs generally dont bite , and if they do , their bites arent harmful
holley said she didnt have any permanent damage or infection
cockroaches have been known to burrow into peoples ears
a south african hospital , for example , pulled two dozen critters out of peoples ears over a period of two years , according to a national geographic article published last year
but , as holley said it was still a roach
in my ear.
