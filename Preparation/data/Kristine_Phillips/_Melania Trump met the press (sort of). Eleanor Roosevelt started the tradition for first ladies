carrying a tin box of candied oranges , eleanor roosevelt walked toward the white house red room to greet the group of 35 journalists , all female
the women , dressed as if they were attending an afternoon tea , sat down , some on chairs and some on the floor

watching from the doorway was a group of male white house reporters , unhappy that such an event was taking place , displeased that they were excluded , and laughing at the group of docile news hens sitting at roosevelts feet
these gatherings wouldnt last six months , the manager of the associated press concluded
on march 6 , 1933 , the new first lady held the first on-the-record news conference by the wife of a president , as recounted by author and speaker robin gerber in her book , leadership the eleanor roosevelt way.
it was a bold move for roosevelt to make at that time , just two days after becoming first lady and three days ahead of her husbands first news conference as president
roosevelt , heeding the advice of her friend lorena hickok , a reporter , invited only female journalists because only male journalists were allowed at presidential news conferences
as gerber explained , white house press secretary stephen early did not like the idea , but roosevelt moved forward
she told the reporters that she would get together with them once a week
the march 6 news conference would be the first of many she would host during the entire length of her husbands 12-year presidency
her decision to counter presidential press gatherings with her own paved the way for future first ladies to become more than just symbolic public figures , according to the white house historical association
modern-day first ladies have used their platforms to focus on specific issues
michelle obama started an initiative for children to exercise and eat healthier
laura bush advocated for education and literacy and used her foreign trips to talk about hiv/aids
trumps fake news awards nothing like the first white house press conference
first lady melania trump announced her initiative at her white house rose garden debut monday
trump said her be best awareness campaign will focus on challenges that children face , including opioid abuse and bullying on social media
trump , unlike roosevelt , did not take any questions
roosevelts news conferences also changed the lives and careers of many female journalists , who relished the chance to report on the white house , a job delegated exclusively to male journalists in the past
some , as roosevelt said , wouldve been laid off from their jobs during the periods economic crisis
roosevelt told the reporters on that first day
she began each gathering by talking about her daily schedules
she talked about the prints on the white house walls
she shared low-cost menus for depression-era households , according to the national womens history museum
she answered questions about her wardrobe and family life
roosevelts newfound platform would soon prove to be an indispensable window into the workings of the white house
on march 22 , 1933 , president franklin d. roosevelt signed into law a measure that amended the national prohibition act
selling 3.2 percent beer was no longer illegal , and the president was asked if he would allow beer to be served at the white house
why melania trump , michelle obama and hillary clinton attended barbara bushs funeral
ask eleanor , the president said , according to gerbers book
ruby black of the united press international then rushed to the airport to catch the first lady
will you allow beer to be served at the white house
she deferred to her husband , prompting the reporter to tell her that her husband had passed on the question to her
roosevelt laughed and promised to give her answer at her next news conference
that following monday , according to gerber , male reporters begged their female colleagues to fill them in
roosevelt soon broadened the scope of her news conferences as reporters pressed her to talk about public policy
she advocated for low-cost housing , equal pay for equal work , pensions and a minimum wage , according to black
she also brought guests , such as foreign dignitaries who were visiting the white house and female members of the administration
in march 1934 , she visited puerto rico and invited some of the female reporters to join her
she also talked about her trips to foreign countries and shared her thoughts about the war
she said on nov. 18 , 1942 , shortly after her trip to britain , a united states ally during world war ii
roosevelt held her last and 348th news conference on april 12 , 1945 , a few hours before her husband died in warm springs , ga
