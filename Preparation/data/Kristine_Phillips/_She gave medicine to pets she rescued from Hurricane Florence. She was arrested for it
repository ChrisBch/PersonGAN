as hurricane florence barreled toward the north carolina coast , tammie hedges decided to open a warehouse she had been remodeling to house pets displaced by the storm
many of the animals were sick , injured and neglected
some cats were covered with so many fleas that volunteers had to scrub their play pen with bleach twice
one cat had a bleeding cut on its neck , and hedges treated the wound with an ointment she bought from a dollar tree store , davidson said
twenty-seven animals 17 cats and 10 dogs were in hedgess care as the storm pummeled the state
but while many saw her actions as an act of goodwill to help animals during a natural disaster , county officials saw a violation of the law
they arrested and charged hedges a decision that immediately spun into a controversy in the community about 60 miles southeast of raleigh
hedges is facing a dozen misdemeanor charges and accused of practicing veterinary medicine without a license
specifically , she is charged with administering medications such as amoxicillin and a topical antibiotic ointment to the animals , according to the nonprofits facebook page
the group said she is also facing one count of solicitation of a schedule iv controlled substance for asking for a donation of tramadol , a prescription pain medication used for animals

hedges , who founded the nonprofit crazys claws n paws to help low-income families with veterinary bills and pet supplies , said in a statement that she and volunteers did what they had to do to help animals displaced by the storm
she and others turned the warehouse into a temporary shelter , equipped it with crates , kennels , litter boxes and blankets , and asked for donations through social media
she said they had been remodeling the warehouse to turn it into a state-approved shelter

on sept. 17 , three days after florence made landfall on the north carolina coast , an official from wayne county animal services went to the warehouse at the request of the state department of agriculture , which oversees veterinary services
the official , according to a statement from the county , developed serious concerns that hedges was practicing veterinary medicine without a license
hedges has surrendered the animals to the countys animal services department , which is reuniting them with their owners , officials said
hedges was arrested friday , and many have since rallied behind her
a gofundme page has raised more than $ 20,000 to help with her legal fees
after florence , thousands of dead fish wash ashore onto a highway
davidson said that the animals had nowhere else to go and that veterinary offices had closed ahead of the storm
there was an emergency veterinary clinic in another county , but she said it was impossible to transport 27 animals in the middle of a storm
the countys shelter had enough room for displaced animals , said wayne county spokesman joel gillie , though it could not accept pets that owners wanted to surrender
hedges has since been released on a $ 10,000 bond , her nonprofit said
she has no attorney yet , though davidson said hedges will consult with a lawyer tuesday
hedges founded crazys claws n paws in 2013
the group relies solely on donations and volunteers , davidson said
