fact-checking president trump has become its own exhausting endeavor for reporters and media organizations
some , including the washington post , have created databases , because writing about every single false or misleading claim many of which are repetitive has simply become impractical
others have struggled with questions about how to challenge the presidents dubious statements when theyre made in rapid succession on live television , or when he is sitting in front of you , willing to spar , deflect , deny and meander
daily bombardments of false claims and false equivalences have forced reporters to challenge the president in real time and sometimes , to his face
cbs news correspondent paula reid did just that monday when trump talked to reporters on his way from the oval office to marine one
the president repeated a false claim that he and the obama administration had the same policy of separating migrant children from their parents
obama had a separation policy we all had the same policy , trump said , answering a question from reid who corrected him on the spot
reid you did not
trump i tried to do it differently , but obama had a separation policy
trump but people dont like to talk about that
reid sir , it was different
you decided to prosecute everyone at the border
that was me , micahgrimes
more to come tonight on cbseveningnews
the president ignored reids follow-up comments , but she was praised for pointing out to the president that what he said was wrong
kudos to cbs correspondent paula reid , cnn chief media correspondent brian stelter wrote in his daily newsletter
really good on paulareidcbs here , tweeted daniel dale , a canadian journalist who fact-checks trumps speeches and tweets
this happens way too infrequently
reids question was prompted by a presidential tweet a day earlier
trump on sunday attacked 60 minutes for airing what he called a phony story about the family separation crisis and claimed that the policy did not start with his administration
barack obama and george w. bush both separated migrant children from their parents because that is the policy and law , he tweeted
that claim is false and was debunked by the posts fact checker in june and again on tuesday
the justice department under former attorney general jeff sessions rolled out a zero tolerance policy of apprehending and prosecuting adults who were caught crossing the border illegally
thousands of children , who cant be detained or prosecuted , were separated from their parents
in 649 days , president trump has made 6,420 false or misleading claims
and as the post reported in june , the idea of ramping up prosecutions of adults who enter the country illegally was conceived during the migrant crisis of 2014
but officials in the obama administration and the department of homeland security considered the policy too extreme
the trump administration was willing to try it
cbs news declined an interview request for reid
a spokeswoman said the reporters questions and follow-up comments spoke for themselves
reporters and media organizations have found ways to fact-check the presidents daily streams of usually repetitive falsehoods
the posts fact checker , for example , has a searchable database of false or misleading claims trump has made since assuming office 6,420 as of oct. 30 about 10 a day
the database can be filtered by topic , and shows which false claims trump has repeated the most and when he repeated them
trumps false claim that obama had the same family separation policy
listen to this president long enough , and you can almost sense when a lie is coming
if trump tells a story in which an unnamed person calls him sir , its probably invented
if trump claims he has set a record , he probably hasnt
if trump cites any number at all , the real number is usually smaller , dale wrote
dale also has created a database of the presidents false claims , filtered by topic and by source
he has noted 3,800 false claims since trump took office
( the posts database is more robust because it includes misleading claims in addition to false ones )
fact-checking trump on live television can be more difficult
as the posts erik wemple wrote , rebutting falsehoods as theyre uttered wouldnt keep the attention of a live audience , especially when rapid-fire misstatements are blurted out at campaign rallies
morning joe co-host joe scarborough tried to do so during trumps nato news conference in july
during the show , scarborough listened to trump and interrupted every time the president said something false
the show aired the news conference and scarboroughs real-time fact check side by side
and reporters who interview trump during news conferences or in gaggles , as reid did outside the white house on monday , may find themselves in a verbal showdown with the president
just ask cnn chief white house correspondent jim acosta , whose white house press pass was suspended ( and later restored ) after he engaged in a testy exchange with trump
its not just me a lot of us do this we push back on these falsehoods on a daily basis , acosta said in august on the late show with stephen colbert
