a d.c.-area doctor was sentenced to three years in prison for slipping an abortion pill into his pregnant ex-girlfriends drink , causing her to miscarry
sikander imran , a former doctor at medstar georgetown university hospital in washington , was sentenced friday after his former girlfriend , brook fiske , asked a judge for a more lenient punishment , abc affiliate wjla reported
imran was charged last june with premeditated killing of a fetus of another and illegally causing abortion or miscarriage
online records show he was also charged in november with assault and altering food , drink and drugs
he pleaded guilty earlier this year to fetal homicide , the associated press reported
imran and fiske both lived in new york and had dated on and off for three years
around the time that imran left rochester , n.y. , and moved to the d.c. region for a new job , fiske found out she was pregnant
but imran didnt want to have a baby and tried to persuade fiske to have an abortion , she told wroc
in may 2017 , fiske , who lives in farmington , n.y. , said she went to arlington to talk to imran about raising their child
unbeknown to her , imran slipped a pill into her drink , she said
fiske told wroc last year
fiske began having contractions a few hours later and was rushed to virginia hospital center in arlington , where miscarried
she was 17 weeks pregnant
fiske said imran gave her 800 milligrams of the pill misoprostol , which is used to start labor , cause miscarriage and prevent stomach ulcers
a nurse at the hospital told her 200 milligrams is enough to induce labor , fiske told wroc
the incident , she said , left her feeling betrayed and devastated.
imran cried that night and admitted what he had done , she said
during imrans sentencing hearing friday , his attorney argued that hes dealing with mental-health issues , according to wjla
the washington post was unable to reach fiske saturday , but wjla reported that she didnt want her ex-boyfriend to serve a long prison sentence
fetal homicide , a class 2 felony , is punishable by up to 40 years in prison
a judge sentenced him to 20 years , with 17 years suspended
online jail records show imran is being held at arlington county detention center
