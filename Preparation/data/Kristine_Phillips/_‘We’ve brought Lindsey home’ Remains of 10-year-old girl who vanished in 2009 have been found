somewhere in the four blocks between her house and her friends house in rural washington state , a 10-year-old girl disappeared in 2009 and was never heard from again
hundreds of officers , volunteers and cadaver dogs repeatedly combed through the small town of fewer than 2,000 people in search of lindsey baum , a brown-haired , brown-eyed girl who loved harry potter and twilight.
thousands of dollars in reward money produced countless tips , but nothing led to the girl , who vanished in mccleary , wash. , on june 26 , 2009 less than two weeks before her 11th birthday
melissa baum said , according to a 2009 article by the daily world newspaper in aberdeen , wash
nearly 10 years later , the search for lindsey ended
a new one this time , for the person responsible for her death began
last september , hunters found human remains in a remote part of eastern washington
the remains were brought to an fbi lab in virginia for dna analysis
several months later , grays harbor county sheriff rick scott , who has been involved in the investigation since 2009 , announced that they were lindseys remains
investigators believe the girl was kidnapped after she left her friends home that night and was later killed
scott declined to share the location where her remains were found , only saying that its seasonally visited by hunters
he also declined to answer questions about what led investigators to believe that she had been killed
the sheriffs office in kittitas county , more than 100 miles from mccleary , said saturday that the remains were found there , in a steep , heavily timbered area with large cliffs and deep ravines
searchers combed the area over the weekend looking for evidence in connection to the girls death
a girl was found dead in a landfill 49 years ago
she has finally been identified
lindsey was last seen around 9:15 p.m. on june 26 , 2009 , when she was supposed to walk the four blocks to her home
her mother reported her missing later that night
the girls family immediately dismissed notions that she might have run away or was hiding
melissa baum told the daily world newspaper shortly after her daughter disappeared.
she cant hide that long she loves to talk.
lindsey was also afraid of the dark and wouldnt have just wandered around she was superstitious about it
to her , midnight to 1 a.m. was the witching hour , her family told the daily world
her father , scott baum , pleaded for her return as he faced a deployment to iraq without knowing what had happened to his daughter
in october 2009 , investigators released a search warrant outlining suspicious activity and inconsistent statements that led them to a man living outside mccleary , the daily world reported
the man had been involved in disturbing conversations about lindsey and had previously been accused of sexual assault
but investigators did not find any evidence of wrongdoing in the mans home
a 1-year-old boy died 44 years ago
his accused killer is now going to trial
as the first-year anniversary of lindseys disappearance approached , scott , then the undersheriff , announced that investigators would ramp up their efforts
witnesses would be re-interviewed , and areas in and around mccleary would be searched again , scott announced
nine years into the investigation that has now taken a different turn , scott promised to bring the monster thats responsible for this and hold them accountable.
