a group of black soybean farmers from the south says a company intentionally sold them defective seeds in an elaborate scheme to place them at a disadvantage because of their race
a lawsuit filed by african american farmers from tennessee and mississippi accuses stine seed co. of selling them seeds they were told were of good quality and would bring successful harvests
but despite fertile soil , ample rain , good equipment and adequate farming capabilities , the farmers say , their yields were significantly lower than expected
farmers from a 2,200-acre farm in rome , miss. , say they lost more than $ 1 million after an extremely poor harvest
the lawsuit says that after the farmers complained about the poor harvest , a company employee told them that the farms were having yield problems
said thomas burrell , president of the black farmers and agriculturalists association , a memphis nonprofit group that advocates for black farmers in the south
stine seed has denied allegations that the company targeted black farmers and sold them subpar products
the iowa-based company is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit , filed in april in federal court in tennessee
calling the accusations inflammatory , the company said the farmers were unable to present evidence proving that they were treated unfairly because of their race
a black lawmaker was canvassing door to door in her district
a constituent called 911
the company said in its motion to dismiss , which was filed monday
myron stine , president of the company , said the lawsuit is without merit and factually unsupportable.
he said stine seed has conducted an internal investigation and found no evidence of racial discrimination
a spokeswoman said that the company provides thousands of seeds to customers every planting season and that those products cover millions of acres across the country
the lawsuit says the farmers bought about $ 100,000 worth of soybean seeds from stine seed in the spring of 2017 after attending an annual farm show in memphis
at the show they met a district sales manager who told them the company had soybean varieties suitable for growing conditions in mississippi
at some point after the purchase , the farmers allege , the company switched the certified seeds the farmers thought they were buying with inferior ones
that meant the farmers ultimately paid far more than what the inferior seeds were worth , the lawsuit alleges
a discrimination settlement was so big it skewed mississippis income data
the complaint cites a mississippi state university laboratory test conducted in december that showed the seeds the farmers bought were dormant
a stine seed spokeswoman said the company has no way to verify the result
and because the test was conducted at least six months after the farmers bought the seeds , the company can not verify the samples provided to the lab , she said
some of the farmers said that they usually produce 34 bushels of soybeans per acre each harvest but that last years harvest yielded less than half that number because of the defective seeds
others said their harvest last year was five bushels per acre down from 35 bushels per acre , according to the complaint
asked how much money hed lost , hall only said considerable.
stine seed said the farmers have failed to cite a single incident showing that the defendants showed hateful or discriminatory conduct
in its motion to dismiss , the company said that the farmers did not identify specific racist statements made against them and that theres no evidence that white farmers were treated differently
burrell acknowledged that no stine seed employees made any racist comments against the farmers
the farmers point to what they say is a history of systemic racism against black farmers in the south
the farmers filing the lawsuit , burrell said , are the new victims of an old problem.
in 1997 , two african american farmers sued the agriculture department , claiming they had been systemically discriminated against and wrongfully denied farm loans and assistance because of their race
in 2010 , the federal government announced a $ 1.25 billion settlement in that suit that went to about 18,000 farmers
hispanic and native american farmers have also sued the government since the 1997 lawsuit
in 2010 , the obama administration offered $ 1.3 billion to settle complaints from female and latino farmers who accused the agriculture department of discrimination
the majority of the countrys black farmers live in southern states , such as mississippi , louisiana , south carolina , alabama and georgia
according to government census data from 2012 , the number of black farmers in the country has risen by 12 percent since 2007
the united states has about 44,600 black farmers , making up 1.4 percent of the countrys 3.2 million farmers
