it wasnt the headline that raised eyebrows it was the tiny text below it
its safest not to drink while pregnant , the headline reads , echoing the consensus among public health organizations around the world
but the next text , in much smaller type , left some room for interpretation about whether alcohol is safe for pregnant women
reads the poster , copies of which were distributed by drinkwise , an australian organization founded and funded by the alcohol industry
public health leaders called out the organization over the posters message , which they said was inaccurate and misleading and undermined the body of research showing that alcohol , no matter the amount , is dangerous for pregnant women to consume
drinkwise withdrew 2,400 posters from hospitals and clinics , the sydney morning herald reported , and changed the text into something less ambiguous
the poster now reads
simon strahan , drinkwises chief executive , said the organization fixed the language after receiving a complaint from the australian medical association
he told the sydney morning herald
drinking can cause miscarriage , stillbirth and lifelong disabilities , according to the cdc
michael thorn , chief executive of the foundation of alcohol research and education , or fare , in the australian capital city of canberra , accused drinkwise of engaging in a campaign to stave off the threat of responsible and effective regulation.
thorn told the morning herald
drinkwise , founded in 2005 , is an independent , not-for-profit organization that focuses on bringing about a healthier and safer drinking culture in australia , according to its website
but critics have long questioned the independence of an organization with a board that consists of representatives from beverage and hospitality industries
but the drug and alcohol review described it as an obfuscation that falsely claims only heavy or frequent drinking leads to higher risks of cancer
some research has suggested such a benefit , but the conclusion remains controversial , and u.s. dietary guidelines recommend that people who do not drink alcohol should not start
the study would have cost about $ 100 million and would stretch over 10 years
the times reported that five large alcohol manufacturers anheuser-busch inbev , heineken , diageo , pernod ricard and carlsberg paid for the study
