glenville , w.va. charlotte greenleaf wont be voting on tuesday
neither will anyone else in her family
never have , never will , she says
politicians just think about themselves.
so she tunes them out doesnt read the news , doesnt watch it on tv
and most certainly does not vote
about half the countrys eligible voters dont vote well more than that in most midterms
yet in a situation such as tuesdays election , with the nation divided into relatively equal-size groups of locked-in partisans and control of congress and some state capitals depending on closely contested races , nonvoters in their own way hold great power
in dozens of battlegrounds , especially in politically essential suburban house districts , its the habitual nonvoters who control the margin
for democrats to take control of either chamber of congress , they must activate masses of voters particularly young people and minorities who in the past have not bothered to show up
many in the party place blame for the trump presidency on a failure two years ago by hillary clinton to turn out the democratic base in key states such as wisconsin , pennsylvania and michigan
and since republicans , too , need support from people who usually dont vote or vote only in presidential years to maintain their majorities , both parties are spending millions to try to move the uninvolved into the fray , if only just this once
heres why americans are voting or not in the midterms
even if candidates and their consultants view them as an elusive but invaluable bunch , many nonvoters see themselves as powerless pawns , scraping together lives that politicians make only more difficult
when greenleaf wants to catch up on the news , she drops by the go mart convenience shop on main street , or the cornerstone cafe down the block , to take in the chatter.
they know whats going on , she said.
i dont need to read nothing.
gilmer county gop chairman willard wright attributes his countys low turnouts to widespread cynicism about politics , fed by a chronic lack of competitive races.
they arent interested enough to educate themselves a lot of times , he said
in an isolated , rural place such as glenville , 20 minutes from the nearest interstate highway , the golden morning light and splotches of fall color on the dramatic hillsides can mask a lot of loneliness and despair
but nonvoters are by no means limited to remote places
in the last midterms , in 2014 , only 36 percent of eligible blacks , 21 percent of hispanics and 16 percent of people under age 30 turned out to vote , according to the u.s
in election after election , big money and all manner of tactics aimed at getting out the youth and hispanic votes have ended with little change in low turnout numbers
record levels of early voting have offered signs in some places that campaigns are reaching new voters but how many traditional nonvoters will show up tuesday remains unclear
across the country , many interviewed for this report remained committed to avoiding the ballot box
a similar disillusionment keeps edwin martinez away from the polls
he was 18 in 2008 , when he cast his first vote for barack obama
that year , 64 percent of citizens under age 30 voted a number that collapsed to 38 percent in 2012
said martinez , a hardware-store employee in the bronx who chose obama again in 2012 but has not voted since and plans to stay home tuesday
a father of three and son of dominican immigrants , he is turned off by the hyper-partisanship and the trump administrations anti-immigrant rhetoric
im not inspired , martinez said , laughing
the reason some people dont vote is that they cant theyre felons or legal immigrants who are not yet citizens
others are disaffected , doubtful that voting has meaning
or theyre uncertain whether they should trust their own judgment
or theyre just plain overwhelmed
padilla , who is 21 and unemployed , having recently left a job at walmart , didnt cast a ballot in 2016 , either too much drama between trump and hillary.
his financial situation is precarious , but he sees no reason to believe that choosing the right candidate would help stabilize his life
the only way he would vote , padilla said , is if i got $ 100 for doing it.
she has voted before , for obama and then clinton in 2016.
but i dont think my vote mattered , she said
edmonds bottom line her life hasnt gotten better or worse since trump took office im not really affected.
aaron abramson , the owner of a dj company in duluth , wrote off voting years ago , after he cast his ballot for sen. john mccain ( r-ariz. ) for president in 2008
many nonvoters didnt start out disaffected
life made them that way
olen anderson , 67 , once trusted the government and felt duty-bound to his country
from 1966 to 1969 , he served in vietnam as an army medic
but anderson , who is retired and lives in upstate new york near the vermont line , has come to mistrust politicians , no matter their party
he has no interest in voting
the country is headed downhill , he said , and theres nothing he can do about it
he watched as his sister was forced to sell the family home because she couldnt afford the property taxes
hes pressed for years to get dentures but said his veterans health insurance wont cover the cost
and he was saddened to see local officials shut down childrens swimming pools in a budget-cutting move
so i just dont believe in the government no more.
