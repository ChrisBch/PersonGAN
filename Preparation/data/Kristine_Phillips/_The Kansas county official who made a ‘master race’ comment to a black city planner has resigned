a kansas county commissioner who made a master race comment to a black city planner has resigned amid swift backlash over what many officials saw as more than just a poor attempt at a joke
louis klemp insisted in a resignation letter tuesday that his comments were well-meaning , not racially motivated , and misinterpreted
but a chorus of local and state officials disagreed , decrying klemp for invoking the nazi-tinged language and calling for his resignation
klemp wrote in a letter to leavenworth county clerk janet klasinski , adding that he regrets the comment and has apologized to the city planner
klemp did not return calls from the washington post
the comment in question happened a week ago during a leavenworth board of county commissioners meeting
the city planner , triveece penelton , was making a presentation about a development project that klemp did not seem to approve of
were part of the master race white county official under fire over comments to black woman
klemp , who is white , told penelton , as he motioned toward his own teeth
klemp told a local television station that he made the comment in jest
he also explained in his resignation letter that he was trying to identify a similarity between him and penelton a space between their front teeth
in an earlier statement seeking to explain klemps comments , leavenworth county administrator mark loughry said that klemp meant to say that he and the woman are part of a master race because they both have a gap between their teeth
klemp had made such a reference several times in the past about people who have a gap in their teeth
though ill-advised , the comments were not a reference to nazis , loughry said
but penelton , a city planner from kansas city , kan. , said commenting on her appearance and referencing master race were unbelievably inappropriate.

the term master race refers to adolf hitlers belief that blond , blue-eyed and tall aryans were the superior race , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum
it was more than a belief system german scientists began a program of forced sterilizations of people they considered inferior ethnic minorities , the physically disabled , the mentally ill and jews
klemps comments have placed leavenworth county , just outside of kansas city , in an unflattering national spotlight and tainted perceptions of residents , businesses and organizations in the community , officials said
the leavenworth city commission said it unequivocally denounces the use of master race or any other language with historical ties to racism
jeff colyer ( r ) said earlier in a statement calling for klemp to resign
last week , leavenworth mayor mark preisinger called a special meeting during which he denounced klemps comments and urged him to apologize
preisinger said last week , hinting at klemps history of making comments with racist overtones

in december , klemp went on a meandering monologue during a discussion about the holiday schedule and mentioned historical figures who he felt should be honored
robert e. lee , the confederate general , was a wonderful part of history , he said
( washington is honored each year , along with other presidents , on presidents day , which falls on the third monday of february
the federal government calls the holiday washingtons birthday , although it doesnt usually fall on his birthday feb. 22 and its known in many states as presidents day )
klemp also said that his great-great grandfather owned a slave , that some black people dont support president abraham lincoln , and he wondered whether oprah winfrey should have a federal holiday
facing criticism , klemp said his comments about the holiday schedule were disappointing and lacking in clarity.
