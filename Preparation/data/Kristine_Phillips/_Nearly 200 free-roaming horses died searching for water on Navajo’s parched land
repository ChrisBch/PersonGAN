nearly 200 feral horses , besieged by famine and dehydration , were found dead on a dried-up stock pond on navajo land in arizona
the animals went to the pond in gray mountain , an unincorporated community in coconino county in north-central arizona , in search of water
but they somehow found themselves burrowed into the mud and too weak to escape , said jonathan nez , vice president of the navajo nation , the largest native american tribe in the country
most of the navajo live in parts of arizona , new mexico and utah
some of the 191 horses were buried neck-deep in the mud , navajo officials said
some were buried beneath others
pictures show the horses overlapping bodies , arranged roughly in a circle on the parched earth
the mass deaths come as arizona experiences a drought unlike anything it has seen in more than a decade
navajo officials say horses dying near an empty watering pond is not a new but a seasonal issue.
the deaths also underscore an overpopulation of free-roaming horses , a problem entangled in competing interests , scarcity of resources and navajo cultural values
wild horses escape the chopping block in spending bill
about 73,000 horses and burros roam free in the western united states that number has far exceeded what government officials say the land can sustain
with such overpopulation , having herds of free-roaming horses has become expensive
damage the animals cause cost the navajo nation more than $ 200,000 a year
according to the navajo department of agriculture , one horse consumes 18 pounds of forage a day
removing as many as 13 dozen horses would save the navajo nation more than 290,000 gallons of water and 1.1 million pounds of forage a year
but the issue has been a divisive one
the navajo tribe reveres horses , which have become symbols of the american west and are deeply entrenched in the navajo peoples beliefs and traditions
in 1971 , the wild free-roaming horses and burros act gave the animals federal protections while allowing the interior secretary to sell or euthanize older and unadoptable animals
u.s. agency may offer $ 1,000 to people who adopt wild horses
navajo leaders have faced resistance in the past when they tried to find ways to control the population
in 2013 , navajo leaders drafted a letter to federal officials expressing their support for slaughtering horses for export
but former new mexico governor bill richardson , actor robert redford and animal rights groups joined in a federal lawsuit to block the revival of horse slaughtering in the country
last month , congressional leaders rejected a proposal to allow the culling of tens of thousands of horses and burros that roam the west or are held in government-funded corrals and ranches , brulliard reported
supporters of the proposal described it as humane euthanization.
animal advocacy groups applauded congresss decision
the animals that were found dead in the arizona watering pond will be buried on site , navajo officials said
one horse did survive
gracie , only two to three weeks old , was found among the carcasses , according to the coconino humane association
she is recovering in a hospital , but her kidneys are not functioning well
