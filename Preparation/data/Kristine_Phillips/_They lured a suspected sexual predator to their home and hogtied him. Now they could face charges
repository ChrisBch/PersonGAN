the man was lying face down on the floor , his hands and feet tied behind his back while a woman could be heard screaming in the background
the woman said as she filmed the hogtied man on facebook live last week
the woman had previously reported the man to police , accusing him of trying to have sex with her teen daughter
but she claimed that investigators in the canadian city of port alberni on vancouver island took no action , so she took matters into her own hands , ctv news vancouver reported
posing as her daughter , she messaged the man , who police said is an acquaintance of the family , on instagram and invited him to her house
after he arrived , the woman punched him , she told ctv news , and then hogtied him on the floor with the help of her husband and another person
the mother , whom ctv news did not name to avoid identifying her daughter , and the two others are the subject of a criminal investigation because of what authorities described as vigilante action.
amelia hayden of the royal canadian mounted police said they could be charged with assault causing bodily harm and forcible confinement
hayden told reporters on friday
a father gets 60 years in prison for trying to sell his daughter for sex
she was 4
vigilantes are described as members of the public who claim to enforce the law but lack the legal authority to do so
cases in which citizens use violence against criminal suspects have been the subject of debates in canada about whether such acts should be considered a crime or a righteous pursuit of justice to compensate for police shortcomings
in 2009 , for example , a store owner was charged with assault and forcible enforcement after he chased a repeat shoplifter and locked him in his van
the store owner , david chen , was acquitted after a trial , but his case and the publics admiration for those who take matters into their own hands raised questions about whether confidence in police was declining
the incident in port alberni occurred thursday
police said the 28-year-old man was lured to the home and was confronted by the three adults
he was taken to the hospital with injuries
police also said that the man , who was not identified , had been under investigation since march for trying to lure a child
in the interview with ctv news , the woman said she reported the man to police after finding explicit messages sent to her daughter via instagram
she claimed that police had not taken any action even after several weeks
the woman told ctv news
her husband , the teens stepfather , said he should be allowed to take measures to protect his family
hayden said the man who was hogtied was not arrested but is under investigation on suspicion of child luring , which is punishable by three to 18 months in prison
