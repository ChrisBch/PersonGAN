police on monday arrested a man accused of killing four people at a waffle house this weekend , ending a 34-hour , door-to-door manhunt that locked down schools and sent fear rippling across the nashville region
authorities discovered travis reinking , 29 , hiding in the woods behind a construction site about a mile from the restaurant where the shooting occurred in the community of antioch , southeast of downtown nashville
police said reinking immediately lay on the ground and surrendered when an officer approached him with his gun drawn
reinking was taken to a hospital after his arrest and booked later monday at the hill detention center on four counts of criminal homicide
reinking requested a lawyer and refused to answer questions or make a statement , said don aaron , a spokesman for the metropolitan nashville police department
he did not explain how reinking eluded officers , police dogs and search helicopters , and he would not say what drove the suspect to allegedly open fire on apparent strangers early sunday morning
reinkings bond was set at $ 2 million $ 500,000 for each homicide count
he is scheduled to make his first appearance in court wednesday morning
reinking had accumulated a long list of red flags in recent years police said he showed signs of mental instability , had extensive run-ins with authorities , and had his firearms license revoked and his guns taken away by authorities last year
he allegedly carried out the mass shooting with one of the guns police had removed
last summer , reinking was arrested outside the white house after he tried to cross a security barrier , declaring himself a sovereign citizen who wanted to speak with president trump
the incident put reinking under the scrutiny of the secret service and the fbi , as well as state and local police in illinois , where he lived at the time
in august , state and local authorities seized his guns and gave them to his father , jeffrey reinking , who agreed to keep the firearms secure and away from travis , officials said
since sundays shooting , the father has told police that he eventually gave the guns back to his son
federal officials said monday that the transfer was probably illegal and that the older reinking might be charged
a young man answering the door at the reinking familys house in morton , ill. , said the family had no comment
police suspect that travis reinking is the gunman who opened fire at the waffle house in antioch just before 3:30 a.m. on sunday , wearing nothing but a green jacket
the man kept shooting as he walked inside , shattering the restaurants glass windows
at one point , he stopped , presumably to reload

among the victims is 29-year-old taurean c. sanderlin of goodlettsville , tenn. , a restaurant employee who was fatally shot while standing outside
the others killed were customers joe r. perez , 20 , of nashville deebony groves , 21 , of gallatin , tenn. and akilah dasilva , 23 , of antioch
two others shanita waggoner , 21 , of nashville , and sharita henderson , 24 , of antioch remained hospitalized at vanderbilt university medical center in stable condition on monday
after the shooting , police said , reinking was spotted fleeing shirtless into a wooded area behind his apartment
just an hour before arresting reinking , police acknowledged having no confirmed sightings of the suspect
even as authorities expanded their search , with 160 officers scouring surrounding neighborhoods , they said they werent sure if he remained in the area
late sunday , a resident of a nearby county told police he had found an empty laptop bag containing a handwritten id card with reinkings name , aaron said , suggesting that the 29-year-old was in that area the same night the shooting occurred
it remains unclear if the bag was dropped before or after the gunfire , police said
reinkings arrest provided few clues about his activities since the shooting
he was wearing a maroon shirt and had a backpack when taken into custody
inside the backpack , police said , was a loaded handgun , .45-caliber ammunition , a flashlight and a holster
a long list of red flags
beginning in may 2016 , reinking had a number of increasingly fraught encounters with authorities
that month , an emergency response officer found reinking in a cvs parking lot in morton , ill. reinking told police that pop star taylor swift was stalking and harassing him , according to police records
reinking believed that swift had hacked into his netflix account and that his family was involved in the harassment
he told police a bizarre story about a dairy queen meetup with swift that ended with him searching for the singer on the restaurants roof
his parents told officers that he had threatened to kill himself and owned guns at home
eventually , reinking agreed to go to a hospital for evaluation , something he told police he had done before
on june 16 , 2017 , police said , reinking went to a local pool wearing a womans pink housecoat he swam in his underwear , exposed his genitals and tried to pick fights with lifeguards
mass shooting statistics the terrible numbers that grow with each mass shooting
an officer called his father , jeffrey reinking , who was out of state at the time , according to reports from the tazewell county sheriffs office
the father told police that he had taken three rifles and a handgun away from travis because his son was having problems
but he eventually returned the guns to his son
three weeks later , travis reinking traveled to washington and picked a fight with federal authorities
according to a d.c. police report
sovereign citizens are viewed by the fbi as anti-government extremists who believe they are not subject to governmental laws , and law enforcement officials have described them as a major concern
there was so much left for him mourning for the victims of the waffle house shooting
while walking past the security barriers and toward an officer , the police report says
do what you need to do , reinking said , according to the report.
arrest me if you have to.
reinking was charged with unlawful entry , a misdemeanor , officials said
he was ordered to perform 32 hours of community service at cornerstone baptist church in morton , ill. , and to stay away from the white house for four months
he mowed grass , ran a forklift to move pallets of food , and packaged food for distribution to local food banks as well as hygiene packets for hurricane relief , according to court records
a letter signed by the churchs pastor , the rev
e. hauter , says reinking completed 33.5 hours of community service
a woman who answered the phone at the church monday said hauter was not available , and we have no comments.
prosecutors dismissed the case against reinking in november after he completed the terms of the agreement
when a persons foid card is revoked , they have to hand it over to authorities and fill out paperwork confirming that their guns have been transferred to someone who has a valid card , the sheriffs office said
reinking signed his four guns over to his father on aug. 24 , 2017 , according to state records
he was not able to possess or own those weapons.
illinois state police said they could not provide details about when reinking obtained the foid card or whether any red flags arose during his application
it was not immediately clear whether he had been diagnosed with any mental illness
illinois law bars someone who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been a patient at a mental institution from obtaining a firearm license
that is your child
the waffle house shooting is the latest attack to raise questions about the systems intended to prevent such violence systems that have repeatedly broken down
in parkland , fla. , police and the fbi did not act upon explicit warnings that a teenager intended to shoot up a high school in the weeks and months before 17 people were killed there in february
tennessee community experiences second mass shooting in six months
in sutherland springs , tex. , a gunman who killed more than two dozen churchgoers last year was able to buy firearms because his domestic violence conviction had not been entered into a national database that would have flagged it during his background check
the fbi said a breakdown in the background check system also allowed a shooter in charleston , s.c. , to obtain the gun he used to kill nine people in a church there
the waffle house shooting is the second in less than a year to hit the town of antioch , where a masked gunman opened fire at a church last year
last fall , reinking moved to the nashville area and worked in the construction industry , authorities said
he was fired from a job about three weeks ago , police said , and was recently hired by another employer but had not been to work since april 16
a few days before the waffle house shooting , reinking nearly had another run-in with police
on tuesday , authorities say he stole a bmw from a dealership in suburban nashville
police later tracked the car to reinkings apartment complex but did not know who the thief was
after the shooting , a key fob for the bmw was found in reinkings apartment , officials said
employees at the dealership had no idea who the man was who took the vehicle , aaron said , noting that reinking refused to give identification to the dealership
police in brentwood said charges are pending in the case
a neighbor near his familys home in morton , ill. , said reinking worked for a while for his fathers company , j & j cranes
but abede dasilva , who was in the waffle house with his brother , akilah dasilva , when akilah was fatally shot , said he is struggling to understand why reinkings family allowed him to keep his firearms
