the teenager lying in brian varelas bed had snorted a fat line of crushed percocet
she seemed really out of it while varela was having sex with her , he later told police , tilting his head and rolling his eyes to the back of his head to show detectives what he meant by really out of it
afterward , she snorted more percocet , and then varela gave the girl a hit of highly concentrated thc , according to a probable-cause affidavit
she collapsed within seconds and never woke up
varela grabbed his cellphone and did a web search for what to do if someone overdoses on perks
the top search results told him to call 911 , but varela did no such thing instead , he took pictures of the 18-year-old lying unconscious and half-naked in his bed , barely breathing
he sent the photos to his friends in a group chat and bragged that he had sex with her , court records say
she looks dead , one friend said
bro you killed her , the same friend said moments later
varela went on to play video games and then fell asleep
he woke up the next morning to find foam coming out of the girls mouth
blood had dripped out of her nose
her body was cold
varela summoned his roommate and a friend , who checked the teens pulse and felt nothing
call the police , his roommate told varela but again , he didnt
he got dressed , locked his room and went to work in the seattle suburb of lynnwood
two fathers raped their daughters
one got 60 days in jail
1,503 years in prison
alyssa noceda died sometime between that saturday night , feb. 3 , when she came to varelas trailer for a party , and the following morning
varela admitted to a friend that he wasnt sure whether noceda was alive or dead while he was having sex with her , court records say
varela , who was 19 at that time of nocedas death , was charged with first-degree manslaughter , second-degree rape and unlawful disposal of remains
he was sentenced last week after a plea deal and will spend less than three years in prison a punishment that many , including the judge presiding over the case , saw as far too lenient
even some auto theft cases had more serious penalties , snohomish superior court judge linda krese said during the sentencing hearing thursday , according to a court transcript
but , she noted , she was bound by state law to keep the punishment to 34 months the maximum allowed for the crimes to which varela pleaded guilty and for someone without a criminal record
and i certainly can understand why the family and friends of the victim feel surprised and even outraged by the sentence thats provided here
the behavior , mr. varela , you described as foolish , i think that that would be a gross understatement , krese said
the behavior that i see described here is appalling
and i think one of the reasons that the law doesnt really seem to adequately address what happened here is that , frankly , it is so beyond the pale , im not sure that the legislature really contemplated something like this
the young man who watched alyssa noceda overdose will serve less than three years in prison for giving her drugs , raping her and joking about her lifeless body over texts with friends
a seemingly lenient sentence for a violent crime such as rape is not unheard of
punishments are typically lessened as a result of a plea agreement or lack of criminal history
in varelas case , his plea deal lowered the manslaughter charge to a second-degree felony , and the rape charge to a third-degree felony
among the most notorious recent cases is that of stanford university sex offender brock turner , whose six-month jail sentence after a sexual assault conviction prompted nationwide outrage and the recall of the judge who imposed the punishment
a jury had convicted turner of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman on the edge of campus
a jury convicted a doctor of raping a patient at a hospital and sentenced him to probation
sentencing disparities are not unheard of , either , even in cases that involve similar crimes
in 2016 , a montana man who repeatedly raped his 12-year-old daughter was sentenced to 60 days in jail after pleading guilty to one count of incest
that same year , a california man who repeatedly raped his teenage daughter was sentenced to 1,503 years in prison after a jury convicted him of 186 felony charges
toni montgomery , a deputy prosecutor in varelas case , condemned him for his complete disregard for nocedas life
but 34 months is really the only sentence that would be appropriate , given the current sentencing structure , montgomery said in court , the daily herald reported
it sort of is beyond the pale morally , when you think about it , montgomery told the times
you can sit here and watch someone die and do nothing and the law can not hold you criminally liable
paul thompson , varelas attorney , also was not immediately available for comment
he told the times that varela was sentenced to the high end of the crimes for which he was actually convicted
standing next to his lawyer during his sentencing , wearing striped green-and-white prison garb , varela , now 20 , apologized for his foolish actions
whatever i get is what i deserve , he told the judge
a father gets 60 years in prison for trying to sell his daughter for sex
she was 4
sitting behind him were nocedas friends and family members , many of whom wore black t-shirts bearing a picture of noceda between angels wings
the teens mother , gina pierson , called the punishment a joke
usually people who do stuff like this dont get away with a slap on the wrist , she told abc affiliate komo news
on piersons facebook page are several pictures and quotes about her daughter
addiction is a disease , not a parenting error , reads one quote
on another post , she wrote my first love..my first bornrip ali mae ( alyssa noceda ) you were too damn good for this world ...
on feb. 5 , two days after noceda went to varelas trailer , her mother posted on facebook that she had not seen or heard from her daughter since 8 p.m. on feb. 3 , court records say
at that time , her daughters body was still in the trailer
on feb. 4 , after returning home from work at a dairy queen , varela washed noceda to rid her body of his dna and put some of her clothes back on , court records show
he then placed her body in a large plastic crate he had gotten from his mothers house , breaking her leg to fit her in the box , records say
two days later , varela was arrested after a co-worker varela had told about nocedas overdose contacted police
officers found the teens body in the box , still inside the bedroom
varela had planned to bury her that day , he told detectives
pierson and her family told reporters that they plan to challenge the states sentencing laws
ill just keep thinking ill never see her again , she told komo
correction a previous version of this story indicated that snohomish superior court judge linda krese had said she was surprised , even outraged by the sentence
according to the court transcript , krese was talking about how the victims family and friends felt about the penalty
