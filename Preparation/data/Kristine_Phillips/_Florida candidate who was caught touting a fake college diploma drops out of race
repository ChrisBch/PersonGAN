melissa howard , a florida state house candidate who gained notoriety after she was caught touting a fake college diploma , has dropped out of the gop primary election scheduled in two weeks
howard withdrew tuesday , a day after she admitted falsely claiming to be a college graduate but vowed to stay in the race , her campaign treasurer , joe gruters , confirmed to the washington post
howard also told local media outlets , including the sarasota herald-tribune , abc affiliate wzvn-tv and florida politics , that she made a terrible error in judgment and that she is deeply sorry.
she told the media outlets
howard did not respond to calls and text messages from the washington post
a spokeswoman for the florida department of state said the agency has not received a formal notice of withdrawal from howard
the diploma fiasco began early last week , when fla news reported that the 46-year-old small-business owner from lakewood ranch , fla. , does not have the college credentials she said she has
howard , who claimed to have a bachelors degree in marketing from miami university of ohio , sought to prove that the fla news story was false by sharing a picture of her framed college diploma
but her story began to unravel after the university revealed late last week that she never graduated and that the diploma was not real
howard broke her days-long silence monday when she said she made a mistake in falsely claiming she had graduated from college
she apologized to her family and supporters and said she didnt intend to deceive or mislead anyone.
florida candidate tried to prove shes a college graduate
the school says her diploma is fake
but howard has yet to address how or where she obtained the diploma
she also did not explain why she falsely misrepresented her academic credentials even though not having a college degree does not disqualify her from running for public office
howard was seeking the gop nomination for the florida house of representatives 73rd district , near sarasota
county gop officials said earlier that they were not calling on howard to drop out and that they would let voters decide aug. 28
kathleen king , gop chairwoman of manatee county , where howard lives , told the washington post
to prove the fla news story was false , howard flew to ohio to get a copy of her transcript from miami university in oxford , and shared a partial picture of it on facebook
she went to her mothers house , where her college diploma had been in storage , as she told local media , and shared a picture of herself and her mother smiling next to it
and she provided fla news with a photo of her wearing a cap and gown during what appears to be a graduation event

fla news rescinded the story and issued a correction only to rescind said correction shortly thereafter
an email from miami university revealed that howard had not been truthful about what degree she supposedly obtained , what year she supposedly graduated , even what major she supposedly pursued
robin parker , miami universitys general counsel , said that the diploma howard displayed showed her graduating with a bachelors degree in marketing
but the university offers no such degree and has always awarded marketing majors a bachelors degree in business
the diploma also stated that she graduated in december 1996 , but she was not enrolled that year
howard attended the university from 1990 to 1994 without graduating , parker said
howards major at miami university was not marketing it was retailing , parker said
if she had graduated , she would have had a bachelors degree in family and consumer sciences

and one university officials name on the diploma should not have been on there , parker said
the diploma has signatures from james c. garland , university president , and robert c. johnson , dean
although garland was president of miami university in 1996 , johnson was dean of the graduate school and would not have been the official signing an undergraduate diploma
parker also said that the university allows students to walk during ceremonies even if they are not graduating , which might explain the picture of howard in a cap and gown
by saturday , after miami university alerted news outlets of the discrepancies , howard was silent
online photos of her transcript and diploma were deleted , and her campaign facebook page was soon deactivated
howards campaign consultant , anthony pedicini , said saturday that howards husband had suffered a cardiac incident , and she is focusing on her family
despite the revelations , her campaign accused the media of engaging in fake news.
asked why the campaign is using the term fake news , pedicini said he has no further comment
on tuesday , he said he no longer works for howards campaign

miami university spokeswoman claire wagner said that school officials are content with correcting the record and have no plans to pursue claims against howard

fla news , which describes itself as the conservative choice for florida news & politics , first reported on howards academic background aug. 7
citing records from the national student clearinghouse , a nonprofit that verifies enrollment and graduation , fla news reported that howard attended miami university from august 1990 to may 1994 but did not obtain a degree
according to howards campaign website , which seemed to have crashed tuesday , she was born to a blue-collar family in middle america and is the first in her family to attend college.
upon graduation , the website said , howard worked for large and small companies before starting her own marketing business
a campaign profile published by the sarasota herald-tribune says howard is co-owner of immexls and international medical trade show and employs five people
