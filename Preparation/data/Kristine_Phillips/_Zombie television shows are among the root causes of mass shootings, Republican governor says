matt bevin ( r ) has been forthright about what he believes are the root causes of mass shootings
a few months ago , he blamed gun violence on childrens access to smartphones , video games and psychotropic drugs
most recently , he blamed societys obsession with a specific genre of violent entertainment
he said in an interview tuesday with conservative kentucky radio host leland conway
mass shootings point to deep cultural problems , bevin said , particularly in a society that consumes daily doses of violence through the media
he acknowledged tying zombie shows to gun violence might be perceived as trite and simplistic.
but , he argued , american culture is inundated by the worst things that celebrate death , including the forms of entertainment young people consume

bevin talked about what he believes causes mass shootings during a portion of the interview about the future of gun rights with democrats controlling the house
democrats , some of whom ran on a promise to push for gun control , are taking over the house on the heels of another mass shooting in which 12 people were killed inside a california bar
some who escaped the rampage are survivors of an earlier mass shooting that killed 58 people at a country music festival in las vegas last year
last month , a gunman stormed inside a synagogue in pittsburgh and killed 11 congregants the deadliest attack on jews in the history of the country
bevin did not mention these recent shootings during the interview , though he said there have been incidents in kentucky
the lives lost in the pittsburgh synagogue shooting
last june , bevin participated in a roundtable discussion about gun violence , the root cause of which , he said , are the ways society poisons the minds of children
he said violent television shows and video games have desensitized young people , and their access to cellphones have made them prone to self-harm and depression
young people , he said , are then medicated with psychotropic , mind-altering drugs
the roundtable was convened by a school safety commission president trump created in the wake of a school shooting in which 17 people were killed in parkland , fla. , early this year
