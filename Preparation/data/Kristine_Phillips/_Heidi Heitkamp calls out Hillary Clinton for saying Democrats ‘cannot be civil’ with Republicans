hillary clinton says democrats can not be civil with republicans who want to destroy what you stand for , what you care about.
and , she added in her interview with cnn , civility in the united states will begin only when the democratic party wins back control of congress
but at least one member of her own party disagrees
heitkamp appears to have been distancing herself from the former presidential candidate whom she praised and endorsed in 2016
heitkamp is facing a tough reelection bid in north dakota , a state that president trump won by 36 percentage points
heidi heitkamp talks to north dakotans about her no vote on kavanaugh i just hope i have the chance to explain why
not soon enough , heitkamp responded
heitkamp had previously spoken glowingly of clinton , telling the daily beast in 2014 that she thought the former secretary of state would run for president and be an excellent commander in chief
exclusive hillaryclinton tells me that president trumps ceremonial swearing-in of now-justice brett kavanaugh last night was a political rally that further undermined the image and integrity of the court.
heitkamp , who won north dakota by a one-percentage-point margin less than 3,000 votes in 2012 , is one of the most vulnerable democrats in the senate
with less than a month left before the midterm elections , heitkamp is defending her decision to vote against the supreme court nomination of brett m. kavanaugh , citing sexual misconduct allegations and concerns over the judges temperament , honesty and impartiality
but kavanaugh , who was accused by christine blasey ford of groping her and pinning her down on a bed during a house party in maryland in the 1980s , is widely supported in north dakota
some polls show heitkamp trailing by double digits against rep. kevin cramer ( r-n.d. ) , who has sought to paint her as someone who chose party over the people she represents
heidi heitkamp says she was ready to vote for kavanaugh
then she watched his body language
speaking with cnns anderson cooper on tuesday night , heitkamp called for bipartisanship and , again , defended her position about believing people who have been sexually assaulted
clinton , meanwhile , has been striking a more partisan tone , blaming republicans for the chaos that has engulfed american politics
clinton told cnns christiane amanpour
