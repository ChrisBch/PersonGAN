in the early stages of a fetuss development in the womb , two embryological structures move to either side of the spine , just below the ribs , and form a pair of bean-shaped organs that will be the kidneys
but in extremely rare cases , the two structures fuse in the middle , forming one kidney
and instead of moving up toward the ribs , it sinks to the pelvic area
its odd , disk-like shape has given rise to a buffet of food names
scientists call it a pancake kidney because its flat
its also called a cake kidney , a doughnut kidney , a shield kidney and a lump kidney
this anomaly can go unnoticed for years and is usually diagnosed only accidentally
such is the case of an 18-year-old man who recently showed up at an emergency room in new delhi with symptoms of bowel obstruction
in examining a scan of his abdomen , doctors saw that his kidneys are joined in the middle and sit just above his bladder , according to a report published last week by the medical journal bmj case reports
a woman showed up at a hospital struggling to breathe because of a 61-pound tumor in her uterus
there are multiple types of kidney or renal fusion , and pancake kidney , which is more common among men , is the most extreme , accounting for less than 10 percent of anomalies , according to the report
a similar case was reported in new delhi in 2014 , when a 19-year-old woman showed up at a hospitals outpatient department with pain in her lower abdomen , fever and a burning sensation when she urinated
a scan showed a fused mass her kidney in her pelvic cavity
in another case reported in jordan last year , a 32-year-old man showed up at a clinic with abdominal pain
an ultrasound and a ct scan showed that his kidney was one flat , nearly rectangular mass located on the right side of his abdomen
a more common type of kidney fusion is called the horseshoe kidney , in which the lower sides of two kidneys fuse during the early stages of development and form one u-shaped organ
theres also the l-shaped kidney , in which an abnormal kidney is positioned horizontally and attached to the bottom of the normal one
in some cases , one kidney goes directly below the other , forming a vertical organ
the shocking reason that this mans legs and hands were amputated a dogs saliva
having a fused kidney does not mean the organ will fail , and doctors generally dont recommend invasive surgeries to correct it
kidney functions tend to be normal , and since most people dont show symptoms , doctors prefer regular checkups to make sure the kidneys are functioning properly
those with these abnormalities , however , are more prone to urinary tract infection and urinary stasis , or the inability to empty the bladder
someone with a horseshoe kidney , for example , is almost twice as likely to have wilms tumor as someone with normal renal anatomy , according to the report
in the case of a pancake kidney , however , cases are so rare that its impossible to determine the likelihood of developing cancer
