president trump has debased american values and ceded global leadership to tyrants and thugs , former vice president joe biden told a crowd in kentucky on friday , unleashing some of his fiercest criticisms yet of the president
biden was campaigning for amy mcgrath , a former fighter pilot and political newcomer whos seeking to unseat rep. garland andy barr ( r-ky. )
kentuckys 6th congressional district , which trump won by 15 percentage points in 2016 , has become one of the most competitive house races amid the fallout over supreme court justice brett m. kavanaughs bitter confirmation battle
even as barr tries to paint mcgrath as too liberal for a state as red as kentucky , the race is widely deemed a toss-up as house races move toward the left
speaking friday night in rural owingsville , ky. , where mcgrath is hoping to win over white working-class voters , biden repeatedly denounced trump and implored voters to help democrats win back the house
how joe bidens 1991 comments about the fbi and anita hill are now being used against democrats
the question is , who are we
before bidens speech , as mcgrath was introducing him , the crowd chanted , run , joe , run.
biden has been traveling the country , speaking at fundraisers and campaigning for fellow democrats
he was in indiana on saturday campaigning for sen. joe donnelly , a vulnerable red-state democrat
still , biden has been coy about announcing a presidential bid , though hes among the more than two dozen democrats who are considered prospective candidates
biden , who has said he will decide on a 2020 run by january , skirted the question while speaking at an event in london this week
hes not eyeing the nomination at this point , he said
biden told cnn
biden has been openly critical of trump , suggesting at a florida rally in march that he wouldve beaten the hell out of the president if they were in high school
speaking in kansas last week , trump said that the fight wouldnt last long and that he would win
those close to trump say biden is the democrat who worries the president and his team the most because they fear he could cut into trumps working-class white support in several swing states , the washington posts ashley parker and robert costa reported
