rep. steve king , the newly reelected iowa republican with a history of incendiary comments about race and immigration , dared a conservative magazine to show evidence that he had called immigrants dirt.
just release the full tape , king , who eked out a victory last week despite affiliations with white nationalists , told the weekly standards online managing editor saturday on twitter
days earlier , the magazine reported that king had made an inflammatory joke about immigrants
the weekly standard released the recording a two-minute audio in which king can be heard bantering with a handful of supporters at the back of an iowa restaurant during a campaign stop on nov. 5 , the magazine reported
he talked about pheasant hunting and his patented pheasant noodle soup sprinkled with whole jalapeo peppers he had grown himself
around the 1:20 mark , king joked that hed have to get some dirt from mexico to grow his next batch of peppers because they didnt have enough bite
trust me , its already on its way , a woman quipped , appearing to refer to the caravan of central american migrants traveling from mexico to the u.s. border
the following day , on election day , weekly standard assistant opinion editor adam rubenstein , who was covering the campaign event and has been critical of king , published an article about the conversation
it included a transcript but not the audio
in a statement to the washington post on monday evening , sarah stevens , kings chief of staff , accused the weekly standard of misrepresenting the congressmans comments and conjuring a false story
stevens said the congressman believed the supporter was referring to dirt coming from the leftist media , not immigrants
in response to the supporter , king repeated similar comments he had been making during the campaign that the leftist media and liberal multibillionaires from coastal states were trying to smear him , stevens said
the magazine stood by its story , saying it quoted king at length to provide readers with context
claiming king was referring to the media is absurd given the context of the conversation , during which the media was never mentioned , according to an editors note at the end of rubensteins story
following the pittsburgh attack , rep. steve kings iowa supporters brush aside concern about his white nationalist views
days after rubensteins story was published , king and the weekly standard engaged in a public twitter fight over what he actually meant
the weekly standard has joined the huffpost at the bottom of the lying journalistic gutter , the congressman tweeted in the wee morning hours friday
king replied later by castigating hayes for defending his reporter
he suggested that the magazine refused to publish the audio because it doesnt exist
hours later , on saturday , the weekly standard did release it , along with a column from hayes
the congressman , who shares president trumps hard-line immigration policies , has a long history of inflammatory rhetoric against immigrants , minorities and the media and has peddled conspiratorial views about white genocide.
rep. king met with far-right austrians on trip funded by holocaust memorial group
he has compared immigrants to dogs
he said immigrants have calves the size of cantaloupes because they haul drugs across the desert
he tweeted a cartoon depicting president barack obama wearing a turban

he endorsed a white nationalist mayoral candidate who questioned whether immigration is causing white genocide.
he said he hoped supreme court justices elena kagan and sonia sotomayor will elope to cuba.
he reportedly attacked the national republican congressional committee for backing a gay candidate
on election night , king barred the des moines register , iowas largest newspaper , from covering his event , calling the paper a leftist propaganda media outlet.
king has been in congress since 2003 , representing iowas northwest quadrant
once on the fringe , king has moved further into the mainstream after trumps election
republicans on capitol hill have largely stayed silent about king
but in late october , rep. steve stivers ( r-ohio ) , the national republican congressional committee chairman , criticized king for espousing extreme views online
