sen. susan collins ( r-maine ) said a crowdfunding campaign that has now collected millions of dollars in pledges to defeat her in 2020 is a classic quid pro quo and a violation of federal bribery laws
collins said sunday on cbss 60 minutes.
a group of liberal activists began the campaign last month to pressure collins , a key swing vote in now-justice brett m. kavanaughs nomination , to vote against president trumps nominee
if collins voted no , donations would not be taken from the donors
if she voted yes , the pledges would fund the campaign of the maine democrat who wins the nomination for the senate seat in two years
collinss office immediately called the campaign an attempt to extort her into making a decision
she told 60 minutes.
activists raised $ 1 million to defeat susan collins if she votes for kavanaugh
she says its bribery
collins on friday announced she would support kavanaughs nomination amid decades-old allegations of sexual assault and concerns about threats to roe v. wade with predominantly conservative justices on the supreme court
her support guaranteed a victory for kavanaugh after a bruising confirmation battle
after collinss announcement , pledges inundated the crowdfunding site crowdpac , causing it to briefly crash
by monday morning , the campaign had surpassed $ 3.5 million in pledges from about 121,000 donors not an insignificant amount for a political race in a state with one of the smallest populations in the country ( 1.3 million )
the unusual fundraising effort by maine peoples alliance , mainers for accountable leadership and activist ady barkan is a sign of an energized democratic electorate and could set the stage for collinss reelection contest
sen. chuck grassley ( r-iowa ) , chair of the senate judiciary committee , told fox news he wants to help raise money to match the funds
marie follayttar , co-director of mainers for accountable leadership , denounced bribery accusations , saying attacking an effort by thousands of small-dollar donors is politics at its worst.
as the decision loomed , anti-kavanaugh demonstrators weighed on a maine senators tiny staff
one ethics expert told the washington post that the crowdfunding campaign may very well violate federal bribery statutes , which prohibit giving or offering anything of value to government officials in exchange for any acts or votes
as the pledges poured in , yet another unusual series of events in these hyperpartisan times unfolded on social media the online crowdsourcing for a nominee and that nominees future campaign staff
tweeted jen psaki , white house communications director under president barack obama
me , susan e. rice , obamas former united nations ambassador and national security adviser , replied , raising a flurry of questions about what her plans are
rice , whose family is from portland , maine , later clarified , saying shes not making any announcements
but on sunday , she kept the possibility of running open , saying she will decide after the november elections whether to launch a bid to unseat collins
speaking at the new yorker festival in new york , rice said collins put party and politics over her own stated principles of supporting equal rights and legalized abortion
susan rice says shell decide after midterm elections whether to challenge susan collins in 2020
jenna lowenstein , a democratic digital strategist who worked on hillary clintons presidential campaign , also said she had enlisted 75 political staff members to help elect collinss future challenger
in a google docs sign-up sheet she created , lowenstein promised to send volunteers to the campaign as soon as there is one
the senate on saturday confirmed kavanaugh in a largely partisan 50-to-48 vote , cementing a conservative majority on the nations highest court
hundreds of protesters many chanting , we believe survivors
vote them out
and shame , shame , shame converged on the u.s. capitol as the senate prepared to vote
kavanaughs confirmation was all but certain after collins , jeff flake ( r-ariz. ) and joe manchin iii ( d-w.va. ) said they would vote to confirm the judge
one republican , sen. lisa murkowski ( alaska ) , broke with her party
collins had initially expressed concern about threats to roe v. wade if kavanaugh were confirmed , effectively shifting the supreme court to the right for decades
the senator also had been among the holdout votes amid an fbi investigation of sexual assault allegations against kavanaugh , whose nomination seemed in peril three weeks ago
