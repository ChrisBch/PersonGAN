myrtle beach , s.c. hurricane florence will begin to lash the carolinas with powerful winds and violent surf thursday in what is shaping up as the most dangerous tropical cyclone to hit the region in a generation
forecasters warn that when it nears land , it could shift to low gear and then meander unpredictably along the coast , sucking energy from the warm ocean as it pounds coastal communities
florences maximum sustained winds weakened modestly wednesday , taking it down first to a category 3 hurricane and later to a category 2 storm , but it simultaneously expanded in size
its hurricane-force winds extend 70 miles from the center of the eye , and its cloud field is four times the size of ohio
on wednesday , a satellite detected an open-ocean wave generated by florence that appeared to be at least 50 feet high
the storm continued slowly trundling northwest thursday morning and was expected to keep slowing down throughout the day , the national hurricane center said in a bulletin
it is expected to approach the coasts of the carolinas later thursday , according to the center , with its still formidable strength not expected to change much before it reaches that area
the national hurricane center on wednesday tweaked the projected track for florence to show a turn to the southwest when the storm nears cape fear in extreme southeast north carolina
florence could potentially drift toward south carolina while remaining just offshore , as if looking for a port
a long stretch of the carolinas remains inside the storm tracks cone of uncertainty.
florence grows larger , threatening a wider area , despite decrease in wind speed
the storm might even reverse direction early next week and head north as a weakened but soggy system dropping rain on already saturated virginia , west virginia , maryland , the district of columbia and pennsylvania
these areas are vulnerable to flooding and downed trees after heavy rains this summer
the forecast calls for 20 to 30 inches of rain in parts of coastal north carolina , with localized amounts of 40 inches or greater
the hurricane could generate a storm surge as high as 13 feet
here in myrtle beach , sandra lopez-garcia cant believe her bad fortune
she survived hurricane maria when it hit her hometown of bayamon , puerto rico , a year ago
she rode out the storm in her concrete home there , sheltering in a bathroom with her therapy dog
now shes in an emergency shelter conway high school just outside of this south carolina city
she said she wishes she were back in her hometown in puerto rico
lopez-garcia said shes confident that local and state government officials have adequately prepared for hurricane florence
but when asked about president trumps assurance that the federal government is totally prepared , she responded with open-mouth shock and shook her head
puerto rico after maria residents see a failure at all levels of government
the uncertainties gnaw at government officials who must decide where to order evacuations and where to dispatch emergency responders
the result can be mixed signals , as was the case here in south carolina , where on tuesday gov
henry mcmaster ( r ) canceled mandatory evacuation orders for several counties along the states southern coast
but then came the wednesday revision in the storm track
as we have been predicting , this hurricane is unpredictable , mcmaster said at a briefing
he said residents in low-lying areas should still leave , even without mandatory evacuation orders , and encouraged those already under such orders to flee
that was echoed wednesday by officials in beaufort county , home to hilton head island
now is the time to move , lt. col. neil baxley of the beaufort county sheriffs office said
he said that residents normally would evacuate to central south carolina but that this time people should flee to the states to the south
georgia and florida , wide open , sunshiny , good shape , baxley said
but meanwhile , georgia gov
nathan deal ( r ) declared an emergency in all of his states 159 counties , citing the revised forecast of the storm
aside from the punishing winds that could strafe the coast for more than a day , the rains expected after landfall could inundate a massive area and trigger widespread flooding
duke energy estimated that as many as 3 million people could lose power in the carolinas because of the storm
hurricane science , never exact , has improved dramatically in recent years , but storms still behave whimsically
florence is riding along the south side of a high pressure system in the upper atmosphere
there is a second high pressure system further west
in effect , one system escorting the storm to land is going to hand the storm off to the next
said rob young , a professor of coastal geology at western carolina university.
thats chaos theory.
he referred to hurricane matthew , which wandered up the southeast coast in 2016 , causing flooding from which some areas have not recovered , as a potential model
hundreds of thousands of people have heeded the call to evacuate , including the residents of an elegant bungalow in historic new bern , n.c. , who wrote on the plywood covering their windows just say no 2 flo.

her boyfriend , lorenzo brown , thinks local officials reacted too quickly
tonya eclebery was also taking one last look at the beach as she walked her 1-year-old yorkie , chloe , by the water
she said she and her husband plan to ride out the storm , hunkered down at holiday sands north hotel , right off the beach , where her husband works as a maintenance employee and where they have a supply of canned food and water
they live in a trailer nearby but decided the concrete hotel overlooking the beach is safer
said eclebery , a housekeeping supervisor.

at the food lion in kitty hawk , n.c. , one state to the north , heavy metal storm shutters covered the windows , and a few shoppers pushed overloaded carts along the almost-empty aisles
