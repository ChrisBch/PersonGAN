in front of the same bright yellow bus at another rally in southern california two days later , surrounded by similar bright yellow signs , republican rep. mimi walters , whos in a tight race in orange county , denounced liberals for raising taxes
walters tweeted that day
days before the midterm elections , california republicans are calling upon a common line of attack line against democrats taxes
the bus tour , dubbed the rush hour rally , is designed to stoke outrage about a recently passed law that raises vehicle fees and gas taxes
proposition 6 , the ballot measure to repeal it , is the rallying cry
even as recent polls show that the measure is losing ground among voters in the democrat-dominated state , proponents insist the opposite as they travel from city to city , armed with bright , eye-catching visuals to hammer their message
theyre hoping prop 6 fulfills a common goal of ballot measures energizing a partys base
it lets california conservatives talk about a salient issue that invigorates republicans without invoking president trump , said gop political consultant mike murphy
for walters and other vulnerable congressional republicans running in suburban southern california districts that hillary clinton won in 2016 , the measure is a way to appeal to college-educated women who normally vote republican but dislike trump , murphy said
house candidates campaign on their agendas , but voters vote on trump
said bill whalen , a hoover institution research fellow
the second , he said , is reintroducing the idea of taxation in a state that has raised taxes twice via ballot measures in the past decade
in a state where driving is ingrained in daily life , a driver would pay about $ 750 annually in fuel taxes and vehicle fees as a result of the tax hike , according to the states legislative analysts office
in north dakota , there are two initiatives on red-meat issues ballot measure 3 , which would legalize marijuana , and ballot measure 2 , which would clarify that only u.s. citizens and state residents can vote in elections
backers of each say they werent created to stoke turnout
the other initiative , the brainchild of a former state gop chairman , tries to outlaw something thats already illegal and wont have a significant policy impact
still , its a catnip for hard-line conservatives
in north carolina , a ballot measure would create a constitutional right to hunt , fish and harvest wildlife
its backed by the national rifle association and is another draw for conservatives , but critics say it unnecessarily tries to protect something thats not under threat
the key is not just rallying behind a hot-button issue
also important is picking a cause that one side cares deeply about and on which the other side is less organized , hudak said
in 2004 , for example , the national republican party mobilized several states to pass ballot measures banning same-sex marriage and to boost republican turnout in key states that reelected president george w. bush
in 2016 , ballot measures to raise the minimum wage were seen as a way to boost democratic turnout
those behind the measures , however , insist theyre not defined by partisan politics
cole haymond , a consultant working with grass-roots activists to legalize marijuana in north dakota , said he has talked to voters who support the measure and heitkamps republican opponent in the senate race , rep. kevin cramer
others , he said , are dismayed with national politics , but will vote on local races and on the ballot measure
gary emineth , the former chairman of the north dakota republican party whos also running for the state senate , said he spearheaded the measure on illegal voting after learning of instances in which non-u.s. citizens voted in local elections
nationally , there has been no proof of widespread voter fraud by undocumented immigrants
but the issue has been used by republicans from president trump on down to appeal to the partys base
im doing it because its the right thing to do , emineth said of the ballot measure
in north dakota , the senate race is already riling up so many voters that there isnt much turnout left to boost , said university of north dakota political science professor mark jendrysik
carl demaio , a former san diego city councilman and the proposition 6 campaign leader , bristled at the notion that the measure was meant to boost turnout and help vulnerable republicans
its foul and misleading and completely illegitimate , said demaio , a republican and conservative radio host
he added that proposition 6 is a citizen initiative without party affiliation
are there republicans supporting it
yes , great , he said
some elected officials did see proposition 6 as a way to spur voter support amid a real threat of democratic takeover of the house
house speaker paul d. ryan ( r-wis. ) , house majority leader kevin mccarthy ( r-calif. ) and walters have each poured thousands of dollars from their campaign coffers to help the repeal effort
so did cox whom polls have shown trailing democratic nominee lt. gov
gavin newsom by double digits
gas tax increase is debated after white house turns to congress for infrastructure help
but the excitement about proposition 6 has begun to falter , as powerful infrastructure and transportation groups put millions of dollars toward defeating the measure
an october survey by the nonpartisan public policy institute of california found that 41 percent of likely voters said they would vote yes on the measure , while 48 percent would vote no , choosing to keep the tax hike
using proposition 6 as a way to appeal to conservative voters may not be working for key republicans , as well
democrat katie porter , whos seeking to unseat walters , announced in an august television ad that she opposes higher gas taxes
other democrats in swing districts also have departed from their party , with some explicitly saying they support proposition 6
these defections seem to neutralize the issue , shrum said
