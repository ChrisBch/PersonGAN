wilmington , n.c. stephen smith spent sunday night sleeping in the stairwell of a parking garage as florence continued to lash this city , days after the hurricane made landfall nearby
he hadnt eaten for two days , and his feet ached from walking to and from the homeless shelter where he usually sleeps , to check whether it had reopened
he had stayed in a hotel for three nights , but his money ran out
his preferred park bench at a nearby lake was covered with tree branches
so he opted for the stairwell
i hope i dont have to do that again tonight , smith said
