the boy was transferred to another school
in april of that year , he attacked his wife in front of their son because she asked the boy to turn down the tv
jones pinned his wife down on the couch , with his knee pressed against her chest

he told his son that his mother was a whore

pitt , the psychiatrist , testified during the divorce proceedings that jones had anxiety and mood disorders , that he was antisocial , narcissistic and paranoid
he lacked remorse and frequently suspected his ex-wife of infidelity , even without justification
he had no friends or confidants , but had a grandiose sense of self importance and required excessive admiration , court records say
jones , though , loved his son very deeply , court records say

the divorce left the child traumatized , staring into space or falling asleep during sessions with counselors
