200 million eggs recalled after nearly two dozen were sickened with salmonella , officials say
years ago , the company was involved in a nearly two-decade-long legal battle with the federal government
in 1990 , three separate outbreaks that sickened about 450 people in three states were traced back to rose acre farms
in response , the government prohibited the company from selling eggs from three indiana farms where the contaminated eggs originated and required expensive cleanups that threatened to put the company out of business
rose acre farms sued , and a few years later a federal judge ruled that the government had overstepped its boundaries and had to compensate the company for income lost as a result of regulations
the judge ordered the government to pay the company $ 6 million
a federal appeals court tossed out the judgment , ruling the regulations did not hurt the companys bottom line
after a few more years of back-and-forth appeals , the case was dismissed in 2009
the recall is the largest since 2010 , when a major salmonella outbreak tied to iowa egg farms sickened more than 1,500 people , said bill marler , a seattle-based personal injury attorney who focuses on food-borne illness litigation
more than 500 million eggs from two iowa farms owned and controlled by austin j. decoster were recalled that year
decoster and his son , peter decoster , each pleaded guilty to one count of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce
