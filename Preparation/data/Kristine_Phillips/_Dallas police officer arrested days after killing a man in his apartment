a dallas police officer who authorities said entered an apartment she thought was hers and killed a young man has been arrested on a manslaughter charge
amber guyger , 30 , was taken into custody sunday evening amid intensifying calls for her arrest and accusations that police are showing deferential treatment to one of their own
the shooting death of botham shem jean , 26 , also has become a rallying cry for advocates against police brutality although much is still unknown about the circumstances surrounding his death
jean was shot thursday night in his apartment building near downtown dallas
guyger , still in uniform after working a shift , went inside jean 's apartment , thinking it was hers , police said
guyger fired her service weapon and struck jean , her neighbor
she called 911 , and jean died at a hospital
a video taken from outside the building shows the officer on her phone , pacing back and forth outside the apartment and crying
paramedics were later seen moving a man on a gurney and performing cpr on him
despite the arrest , jean 's mother , allison jean , said several questions about her son 's death remain unanswered
allison jean stood in the middle of her two other children , a son and a daughter , as she spoke to reporters her way of representing botham , her middle child
it also is still unclear why investigators held off for three days before charging guyger with manslaughter
dallas police chief rene hall had said earlier that her office was in the process of obtaining an arrest warrant but that it was postponed after the texas ranger division , a separate agency that took over the case , asked for more time
hall said investigators had interviewed guyger and sought more time to look into the information she gave them
things changed sunday evening , when guyger turned herself in at kaufman county jail , just outside dallas
merritt did not elaborate , citing the pending investigation
a police officer walked into a mans home mistaking it for her own and killed him , police say
a grand jury will ultimately decide on the final charges against guyger
it could look at charges such as murder , a first-degree felony , or the lesser charge of manslaughter , a second-degree felony
dallas county district attorney faith johnson vowed thoroughness and fairness as her office prepares to present the case to the grand jury
johnson told reporters
guyger , who has been with the police department for four years and is now on administrative leave , has since been freed on a $ 300,000 bail
the dallas morning news reported that her attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment
the delay in the officer 's arrest frustrated jean 's family members , who arrived in dallas from the caribbean island of st. lucia , where jean was born
it also raised questions about whether investigators were showing deferential treatment to the officer
merritt said jean and the officer did not know each other
the officer 's apartment was directly below jean 's , he said
a police spokeswoman referred questions to the texas ranger division
the texas department of public safety , which oversees the rangers , declined to comment beyond a brief news release announcing guyger 's arrest
the district attorney 's office also has not responded to a request for comment
jean 's death renewed calls for policing reform and places the national spotlight back on a police department that , just two years ago , lost five of its officers in a shooting
a gunman who said he wanted to kill white people , especially white officers , opened fire in july 2016 in the middle of what had otherwise been a peaceful protest of police shootings
during a criminal justice panel saturday , hall said she did not know whether race was a factor in jean 's death and asked the public for patience as investigators do their work
jean was black , and guyger is white
merritt , who also represents the family of antwon rose ii , an unarmed teenager who was shot by an east pittsburgh police officer , said race and police officers use of force are deeply intertwined in this country
on the night of the shooting , guyger 's apartment key was found in jean 's door , suggesting that she had tried to open it , merritt said
seeing a black man inside an apartment she thought was hers influenced her actions , merritt concluded

jean moved from st. lucia to arkansas and later became a naturalized u.s. citizen , merritt said
he graduated in 2016 from harding university , a private christian school in searcy , ark. , where he was a member of an a cappella group that performs spiritual songs for churches
jean frequently led singing at the university chapel and during campus events
university officials said
bruce mclarty , president of the university , said he once asked jean to lead the singing of an unfamiliar old hymn
jean was eager to sing it , even though he had not heard of the song
the day he was to perform it , mclarty recalled , jean called his grandmother in st. lucia , and she taught him the song over the phone
allison did an incredible job of raising her son , st. lucia prime minister allen chastanet told reporters.
we at st. lucia are extremely proud of botham
we learned this morning of the tragic death of 2016 alumnus botham jean , who was shot in his home last night
our entire family grieves today for the loss of botham who has meant so very much to us
please join us in praying for bothams friends & family
