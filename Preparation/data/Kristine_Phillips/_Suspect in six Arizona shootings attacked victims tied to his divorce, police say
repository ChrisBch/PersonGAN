some were connected to a messy divorce over which jones seemed to have held a grudge for years , scottsdale assistant chief of police richard slavin said
police also suspect jones had killed a man and woman in a home in fountain hills , ariz. , a town outside of phoenix , though they have not said why they think jones killed them
slavin said ballistic evidence connected the killings of psychiatrist steven pitt , paralegals veleria sharp and laura anderson , and psychologist marshall levine
on sunday morning , police had identified jones as the suspect and had taken a dna sample from family members that they believed linked him to the crimes
shortly after police began surveillance sunday afternoon , they witnessed jones dispose of a pistol , which police said was not used in the crimes , but belonged to the male victim from fountain hills
officers with the scottsdale and phoenix police departments tracked down the suspect at an extended stay hotel in scottsdale on monday morning
vince lewis , a spokesman for the phoenix police department , told reporters that jones fired shots from inside his room as tactical team members were evacuating the hotel
they later found jones with a self-inflicted gunshot wound , lewis said , adding that the officers did not fire their weapons
the victims in the days-long killing spree worked in related fields , a fact that had raised fears that the suspect might be indiscriminately attacking people who worked in the criminal justice or court system in the phoenix area
pitt , a 59-year-old forensic psychiatrist who had consulted in high-profile murder cases , including the 1996 killing of child beauty-pageant star jonbent ramsey , was shot thursday afternoon outside his office on the outskirts of scottsdale
jones had been required to see pitt as part of his divorce proceedings , slavin said
a psychiatrist in the jonbent ramsey case was gunned down
then police discovered more bodies
sharp , 48 , and anderson , 49 , the two paralegals , were shot at a law firm in downtown scottsdale at about 2 p.m. friday , less than 24 hours after pitt was killed
police said one of the women , who had been shot in the head , was able to get out of the building and flag a bus driver for help before she died
police followed her blood trail and found the other victim
the two women were paralegals for the family law firm burt , feldman , grenier
joness ex-wife , connie jones , had retained elizabeth feldman as her divorce lawyer , slavin said
just after midnight saturday , levine , a psychologist and counselor , was found dead with a gunshot wound in his office , about halfway between the sites of the previous shootings
slavin said levine didnt come home that night , so his girlfriend went to his office to find him
levine was not part of joness divorce case
but as part of the proceedings , the suspects son was required to see a counselor who happened to share an office space with levine
police had initially said little about the suspect , other than that he was an adult male
earlier , phoenix police released a sketch of what appeared to be an older white man wearing a hat
on monday afternoon , they released a photo of jones , who is black
slavin said he couldnt speak to joness motivations , but evidence suggested he was angry about the divorce
police said dwight jones had lived in extended stay hotels for nine years
connie jones filed for divorce in 2009 , but news 12 , a local nbc affiliate , obtained records that showed the case was not resolved until 2017
the suspect in the phoenix-area killings fits that description , yaksic hypothesized based on information published about the deaths
a 1-year-old boy died 44 years ago
his accused killer is now going to trial
before police identified jones , some speculated that pitt , the first victim , might have been killed because of his profession , a line of work that required him to study the minds of criminals
yentes said he knows of several law phoenix-area law firms that did not open monday because of fears of being targeted , and some have talked about having uniformed officers in their lobbies
steve silverman , an insurance-claim lawyer , does not know any of the victims , but he has been on edge for a few days
levine , the psychologist , was shot and killed across the street from silvermans house
and the hotel where jones is said to have killed himself is right next to his office in scottsdales agua caliente shopping center
that the suspect killed the victims in their workplaces , and that he was unidentified for days , only raised fears for silverman that he might run into the killer
before news broke monday morning that the suspect was dead , silverman had contemplated not coming to work
the day before , he had planned to come to the office but decided to stay home
police arrested a man in killing of mother and stepfather
they now say he killed seven others
that paralegals were attacked also struck a nerve with him
the washington post was unable to reach the law firm where the paralegals worked
in a statement to the arizona republic , the firm said both sharp and anderson were dedicated and treasured members of its staff
both were wives and mothers
pitt also helped police as they tried to solve a string of crimes that terrorized phoenix in 2006
mark goudeau , nicknamed the baseline rapist and later the baseline killer because the crimes first happened along phoenixs baseline road , was convicted of more than five dozen charges , including several counts of murder , rape and kidnapping
a biography on pitts website says he also consulted and advised prosecutors in the colorado rape case against kobe bryant and in the columbine high school shooting investigation
levine owned a clinic called peak life solutions and was a life coach hypnotherapist , according to his profile on psychology today
levines profile reads.
my clients fulfillment is my joy.
there have been several serial killers in the phoenix area over the years , said yaksic , whose organization maintains a database on 2,700 serial killers nationwide
most recently , a man named cleophus cooksey jr. was accused of fatally shooting nine people in phoenix , including his mother and her boyfriend , in november and december
