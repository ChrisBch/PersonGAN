wilmington , n.c
florence has been bearing down on the carolinas for days , and it has expanded in size , with tropical-storm-force winds extending nearly 200 miles from the storms eye
the storm crossed the gulf stream on thursday and slowed dramatically , to just 5 mph , as it approached land

the national hurricane centers forecast thursday pinpointed wrightsville beach , n.c. , for landfall of the eye
but it could aim north or south as it nears shore , and the massive storm could have catastrophic effects far from wherever it hits the beach
as winds and rain picked up during the day and conditions quickly deteriorated , thousands of people moved into emergency shelters to ride out what officials have called the storm of a lifetime.

catastrophic surge and flooding feared
dozens of north carolina school districts were closed , as well as nearly all schools in the university of north carolina system
roy cooper ( d ) said that about 12,000 people were in 126 shelters by thursday evening , with more expected to be added
an additional 4,300 people were in 61 shelters in south carolina , officials said
florence has been looming offshore , with its wind speed fluctuating on thursday it was downgraded to a category 2 storm from a category 4
that created some confusion and , officials feared , complacency
officials pleaded with residents across the carolinas to treat the storm as a deadly threat
they said a storms category describes only its wind speed , and that the overwhelming flooding that could follow is a far greater threat
forecasters warned that florence was poised to create a dangerous storm surge of up to 13 feet in parts of north carolina
henry mcmaster ( r ) said
duke energy said it would close a pair of nuclear power reactors at its brunswick plant on the cape fear river , about four miles from southport , n.c
the company said its procedures required closing the plants when facing sustained 75 mph winds , even though the plants were designed to withstand winds of more than 200 mph and a storm surge of 22 feet
florence is widely seen as a test for the federal emergency management agency , whose capabilities were stretched thin last year as it responded to three major hurricanes
the federal response was especially criticized following hurricane maria in puerto rico , which even a year later is still struggling to restore even basic services
fema administrator william brock long said during a briefing thursday
long urged patience and warned that it would take time to recover from florence
pentagon officials said about 7,000 service members , including 4,000 national guard personnel , were positioned for the storm and that thousands more were prepared to deploy if needed
they said the military had made sites , including fort bragg , n.c. , available to fema as staging areas for relief equipment and had put helicopters and high-wheeled vehicles at the ready in different sites in the southeast for search and rescue use
ships including the uss kearsarge are at sea trailing the storm and will move toward shore to further support emergency response
said air force gen. terrence oshaughnessy , who heads u.s. northern command and the north american aerospace defense command
despite reassurances from fema and trump , florences fluctuations and course-change predictions have added to the difficulties of preparing for such a massive storm
on monday , with the storm appearing to shift south , mcmaster , the south carolina governor , ordered schools in aiken county , near the georgia line , to close for the rest of the week to free up shelter space for hurricane evacuees
the next day , he rescinded the order when it appeared the storm was shifting north
but by thursday morning , florence had changed direction again and state officials were considering closing at least some schools again
eric abdullah of the aiken county sheriffs office , who said officials were trying to stay flexible
some evacuees who have been displaced since tuesday were increasingly growing impatient and anxious as reports about where the storm would hit , and how hard , have changed
bill berlino , 83 , said he was skeptical of the news reports hes seen about the hurricane
he said its as if weather reporters were competing to see who could issue the most dire predictions
weve wasted three days of discomfort and displacement , he said
about 470 evacuees were at north myrtle beach high school as of thursday afternoon , and an additional 200 are expected to arrive , said trevor strawderman , the principal
the high school is just a mile from the ocean , but it has been an evacuation center during at least eight hurricanes because it is located on elevated land , strawderman said
many of the evacuees are workers from american samoa and jamaica who were contracted as housekeepers at myrtle beachs waterfront hotels
hotel companies house the workers at apartment villages and took them by bus to the shelter , strawderman said
two of them , itagia veavea , 25 , and karen tominiko , 19 , are not as anxious as the others because they are used to hurricanes in american samoa
they have also been praying , singing songs in their native language
some people have decided to simply ride out the storm at home
late thursday afternoon near the dockside restaurant , just across the intracoastal waterway from wrightsville beach , a group of about a dozen homeowners stood under a pergola amid sheets of rain
jack kilbourne , 52 , and his son charlie , 13 , were among the group of neighbors who live in large homes overlooking the waterway
kilbourne said the houses sit 18 to 30 feet above sea level , so they were not worried about the storm surge
