lumberton , n.c
they came to the shelters bearing blankets , bibles and board games , folders of family photos and insurance papers , treasured stuffed animals , and a weeks worth of cigarettes
they carried life jackets , televisions , zip-top bags of medication , and grocery bags full of mixed nuts and chocolate chip cookies
they came with their children , their grandparents , their friends who are closer than family
and nearly all of them came with painful memories of hurricanes past hugo , floyd , matthew and the fear that this one would be even worse
across the carolinas and georgia , several other large public facilities and makeshift camps opened to serve those who had fled their homes
some had shown up days before the storm made landfall , when it was still hard to imagine storm clouds filling the blue september sky
others walked through the shelters doors after the hurricane had struck , shocked by its ferocity and drenched by the rain
and sometimes , tragedy came to them
an evacuee at the west brunswick high school shelter in shallotte , n.c. , died thursday morning
a brunswick county spokeswoman said an investigation was underway , but that the death was unrelated to the storm
in the southeastern north carolina city of lumberton , the gymnasiums at the high school reached capacity 450 people before the rains even started
the city was among those hardest hit in 2016 by hurricane matthew , which submerged streets beneath several feet of water and destroyed hundreds of homes
but there was still so much to do
the shelter was short about 100 green cots , and there were not any medical beds for an older woman named mary , who had a bad knee and could not bend down
there was dinner to organize chicken and rice , fried okra , and pineapple tidbits , served on foam trays by the schools cafeteria workers
one woman had a panic attack in the chaos and had to get picked up by her son
chris and jen jolin of newport , n.c. , had a different strategy
on tuesday , they packed everything they could in their 2003 ford taurus including their three children and mixed-breed dog , gigi and embarked on what became a four-day ordeal to find safety
they tried the local hurricane shelter , but it didnt have a crate big enough for gigi
plus , jen jolin was worried it was going to be too close to the storm surge and flood
so they journeyed to higher ground , driving 400 miles with a plan to camp in the mountains
but the $ 30 campground fee was too high they had just paid all of their bills for the month
said jen jolin , who cleans condos on the beach for $ 25 a unit.
we couldnt afford to stay there five nights.
so they set up their tent in a nearby walmart parking lot with other evacuees but were kicked out by a store manager at 5 a.m
they ended up at the atlanta motor speedway , which opened 5,000 campground spaces and free showers to evacuees
we were told to evacuate , jen said.
it would have been easier to stay.
there were 19 mobile homes and trailers parked at the speedway on friday
many were far from home , but there it was 93 degrees and dry no threat of rain
and unlike many shelters , the evacuees were allowed to have their pets
stephen durham had come from his home in myrtle beach , s.c. , pulling a 16-foot trailer
he said he didnt want to be one of those people , the ones desperately waving their arms from the rooftop pleading to be rescued as their homes were surrounded by rising floodwaters
his wife , marge durham , agreed
just outside myrtle beach , todd dunn , 44 , came to the shelter at conway high school on tuesday in an ambulance
he cant walk because of neuropathy in his legs caused by type 2 diabetes
hes also completely blind and lives alone
on friday morning he sat on a cot in a part of the shelter known as the medical ward , which filled a hallway and part of the schools cafeteria
nearby , 74-year-old nancy stroman had brought a lounge chair to sleep on
she said she is comfortable at the shelter , a far safer place to ride out the storm than her apartment by a lake , where she , like dunn , lives alone
but it gets cold at night in the medical ward , she said
we need hot drinks , stroman said.
seniors cant be cold
im always cold.
some patients had heart ailments , some were pregnant , some needed constant medication
ages range from a days-old infant to a 100-year-old woman , said amy eathington , a retired nurse and red cross volunteer
its very similar to working in an emergency room , eathington said
at a shelter in rural aynor , s.c. , 7-year-old rosalie hardee and her 4-year-old sister , christina , came with purple pony sleeping bags , stuffed toys , an ipad , crayons and some papers
they passed out their pictures of hearts , butterflies , trees and unicorns to their fellow evacuees
like so many others , their father , kenneth hardee jr. , 29 , wanted to avoid a repeat of what happened to his family during hurricane matthew
the storm washed off the dirt road leading to their mobile home , turning it into a three-foot-deep ditch , and tore down oak trees nearby
the giant limbs blocked the main road
we got stuck in there , he said
he and his brother had to walk three miles to get help , he said
so , days before hurricane florence struck , hardee took his wife and daughters to a middle school , where there is a backup generator and they would not have to worry about flooding
meanwhile , his girls worked on their latest masterpiece a drawing of flowers and animals around the words thank you all , which they gave to police officers at the shelter , who taped it to a table , charmed
but as the winds picked up and the rains came down , life in the shelters began to wear on the evacuees
residents of the first baptist homes , an affordable housing facility for seniors and people with disabilities , arrived at the lumberton high shelter with fears about losing everything they hadnt been able to bring with them
lola smith , 69 , wearing a t-shirt printed with the words amazing grace , had been consoling her neighbors , speaking in a gentle , no-nonsense tone that made some of them call her mom.
but after two days , even she had begun to wish she had stayed in her apartment
staffers at the shelter would not allow evacuees to eat anywhere but the cafeteria
there were no showers , not even hot water for a sponge bath
and it had been almost impossible to sleep on the narrow canvas cots provided by the red cross
its not a permanent thing , she told herself
but already she was checking the forecast and praying for a reprieve
