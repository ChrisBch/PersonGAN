junkyards , motels , industrial sites , a run-down ice-skating rink and an airport drive-in theater once sat along a stretch of highway in virginia , south of washington
it was desolate and ugly
but local developer robert h. smith saw beyond the dilapidation sitting west of the potomac river
he saw that it was right next to what is now reagan national airport
he saw that the pentagon was within spitting distance
he saw that downtown washington was a short drive away
he saw that people could live and work there
in the early 1960s , smith embarked on a years-long plan to transform the area
first , he negotiated a long-term deal with the washington brick and terra cotta co. , which owned much of the land in the area and in neighboring pentagon city
then he began to build
his first project was an apartment building on the west side of the highway
he wanted to give it a name and a brand , so he installed an elaborate crystal chandelier in the lobby and called it crystal house , the washington post reported in 2009
then he built crystal gateway , crystal towers , crystal square , crystal plaza , many of which were located on crystal drive , where smith lived in a penthouse apartment
amazon hq2 decision amazon splits prize between crystal city and new york
and thats how the once-barren wasteland known only as route 1 , after the highway bisecting it , became crystal city , an arlington county enclave with its own transportation hub and lined with restaurants , high-rise apartment buildings , and government and corporate offices
on tuesday , amazon announced that it has chosen crystal city as one of two locations for its second headquarters a development that would again transform this urban neighborhood
benjamin r. jacobs , founder of jbg cos. , told the post in an interview about smith after he died in 2009
smiths father , charles e. smith , was against developing the area
but he followed through on his vision.
from the 1960s to the 1980s , smiths family business developed and rented more than 40 buildings in crystal city
he lured renters with modestly priced rents
a one-bedroom apartment at crystal house , for example , cost $ 145 a month , including all utilities
and he offered bargain lease rates to lure federal government offices out of the district and into crystal city , fusarelli said
now , nearly six decades after smith first surveyed the area , crystal city will undergo another transformation and a re-branding
amazon could be boon or bust for metro and the regions transportation infrastructure
amazon.com announced tuesday that it is building its headquarters in national landing , a newly branded neighborhood that encompasses parts of crystal city and pentagon city in arlington , and potomac yard in alexandria

nine years after smith died of a stroke at 81 , the first apartment building he built crystal house still stands
roseland residential trust bought it in 2013 and renovated it four years later
the elaborate crystal chandelier no longer adorns the lobby
