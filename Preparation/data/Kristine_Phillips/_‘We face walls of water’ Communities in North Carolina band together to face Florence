lumberton , n.c
the call went out through facebook at a little past noon on friday volunteers were needed immediately to fill sandbags and dam up a railway channel where floodwaters have emerged before
said state sen. danny earl britt jr. ( r ) , who organized the sandbag marathon at west lumberton baptist church
men and women , young and old , worked for hours alongside members of the national guard to fill the white sacks with mud dug up with backhoes
soon , sweat mingled with the rain that splashed their faces and drenched their clothes
the work was wet and difficult , but essential the lumber river , which runs through town , was expected to rise by as much as 20 feet as a result of rains from florence
it was not a question of whether the river would overtop its banks , but when
as florences winds and rain swept across the carolinas , communities such as lumberton scrambled to prepare for the surge in flooding that would inevitably follow
north carolina gov
roy cooper ( d ) said saturday morning during a briefing
florence was downgraded to a tropical storm friday
but its slow forward movement means that coastal and southeastern areas will still get the brunt of its deluge
parts of north carolina already have received a record-breaking 30 inches of rain , and many areas are expected to get at least 15 more inches
the national weather service forecasts major flooding at most rivers statewide
some areas are already experiencing flash flooding , which occurs when rainfall is so great that it overwhelms drainage systems
but a growing concern is river flooding , which happens as tributaries and basins drain into main rivers , causing them to overtop their banks
some rivers may not crest for several more days
all or parts of 18 counties in north carolina had issued mandatory evacuation orders , warning that the flooding from this storm is likely to be even worse than it was during hurricane matthew , which devastated the state in 2016
said nathan walls , a spokesman for the city of fayetteville , n.c. the worst is yet to come.
in robeson county , which includes lumberton , matthew caused the lumber river to exceed its banks by 12 feet
the water burst through the rivers aging levees and destroyed hundreds of homes
rick foreman of west lumberton baptist church said one of his parishioners drowned in matthews floodwaters
during florence on friday , he watched as the volunteers worked to bolster one of the two flood-prone stretches of the river that could threaten his church
we kind of have a double whammy on us , he said
the rain kept coming
were in gods hands , foreman said.
we all know that.
by saturday afternoon , the lumber river was 1 feet above flood stage
it could rise as high as 25 feet before the storm is over , forecasters said
the county ordered mandatory evacuations for the southern part of lumberton , and spokeswoman emily jones urged people living in low-lying areas and mobile homes elsewhere in the county to seek shelter
many residents heeded the advice
two of the countys four shelters were already at capacity saturday
deridre hill is waiting out the storm at the holiday inn express where she is an assistant manager
two years ago , the flooding around her apartment was so bad that she and her family had to wait a week before they could be rescued by boat
then , they packed up their two young sons and left
its nerve-racking not knowing what is happening to her home while shes away , hill said
but it would have been even more frightening to stay there
im just lucky i have somewhere to go , she said
in fayetteville , where the cape fear river is forecast to rise an astonishing 45 feet by tuesday , a mandatory evacuation order was issued saturday
said rogers , who is african american
during matthew , he said , officials didnt make an early effort to warn people about the danger
four people in fayetteville died during flash flooding from that storm
this time , mayor mitch colvin , who also is african american , said hes doing his best to ensure that his city is prepared , as well as working closely with the community to make residents feel supported and to help them leave
firefighters and police officers have been driving from neighborhood to neighborhood , explaining the risk and encouraging people to seek shelter
if the forecasts are correct , his city could experience 62 inches of flooding in the coming days
there is no holding back waters like that
all people can do is get out of the way
in the coastal city of new bern , n.c. , on friday , floodwaters had combined with the storm surge to deluge neighborhoods in as much as 10 feet of water offering a preview of what other communities might endure
by saturday , the relentless wind and rain seemed to sap the color from the city
everything was washed in tints of brown and gray
down one street , a refrigerator bobbed on its side
a boat that was normally parked in a back driveway had floated its way to the front door
in front of a house whose owners moved in last week , the water was up to the mailbox
a jet ski was the only mode of transportation
volunteers steered their rescue boats around the rounded tops of submerged cars as though they were icebergs
in drier areas , cars with wet leaves stuck to their sides lined up for gas only to have their drivers told that the power had just gone out , and that there was no telling how long theyd have to wait
the waccamaw river in conway , s.c. , just outside of myrtle beach , had swollen to almost 10 feet saturday afternoon just below flood stage
its projected to hit 19.2 feet by the middle of next week about a foot higher than the record set during matthew
in her living room overlooking the river , lisa skipper was packing valuables in trash bags that she and her husband , ricky , were about to load into a u-haul van
everything else they couldnt take pots , pans , table lamps , pantry items , bottles of alcohol and other items was arranged on the kitchen counter , out of the reach of floodwaters
the house was built in the 1960s and belongs to rickys father , earl , who evacuated earlier this week
living by a river that frequently floods has always been troublesome
ricky skipper said they installed new floors in his fathers house in 2016 only to replace them when matthew hit , drenching the home in a foot and a half of water
given the forecast for florence , they probably will have to replace the floors again
but the family , especially earl , cant imagine leaving the home that holds so many memories of his late wife , frances
lisa skipper said , as she looked out the windows in the nearly empty living room
as the skippers finished loading their u-haul , their neighbor , emy chamberlain , 21 , was walking her dog , fergie
she said she and her family had evacuated ahead of the storms landfall and had just gotten back home saturday
now they could only wait to see what damage the flooding might bring
