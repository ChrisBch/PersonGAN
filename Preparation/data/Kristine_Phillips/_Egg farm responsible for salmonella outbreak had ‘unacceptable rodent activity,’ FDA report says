a north carolina egg farm that authorities say is responsible for an outbreak of salmonella illness that has sickened several people in nine states has had a heavy rodent infestation and failed to take actions to reverse it , according to an inspection report
dozens of rodents , some alive and some dead , were found inside rose acre farms hen houses in its north carolina facility
many , the u.s. food and drug administration report says , were burrowing in manure piles
insects also hovered around chicken feeds and throughout the farm
employees were seen touching body parts and dirty surfaces while handling food
thirty-five people who consumed eggs traced back to rose acre farms facility in hyde county , n.c. , have been sick since last november , the centers for disease control and prevention said
the inspection described in the report was conducted from late march to mid-april , in response to the outbreak of illness
salmonella sickens nearly three dozen people amid recall of more than 200 million eggs
the report says that rodent infestation had been a problem at the companys hyde county farm since at least last september
by late march and early april after several had already been sick an inspector visited the facility multiple times and found dozens of rodents running around rows of poultry houses
a few carcasses were found lying in and outside the houses
sanitation procedures were also neither implemented nor followed , the report says
employees were seen touching their faces , hair , buttocks and dirty surfaces and then handling food without changing gloves or washing their hands
production equipment were covered in dirt and food debris and were unclean for multiple days during the inspection
one employee was seen cleaning equipment with a steel wool scrubber that had been stored on a cart in a dustpan with a pool of dirty water
condensation was also seen dripping from ceilings , pipes , walls and onto production equipment
the unsanitary conditions and poor employee practices created an environment that allowed for pathogens that could cause egg contamination to thrive throughout the facility , the report says
the hyde county facility produces 2.3 million eggs a day from 3 million hens
eggs produced at the farm are distributed to retail stores and restaurants in colorado , florida , new jersey , new york , pennsylvania , virginia , west virginia and the carolinas
illnesses have been reported in all those states , the majority of which were from new york and virginia , the cdc said
200 million eggs recalled after nearly two dozen were sickened with salmonella , officials say
eleven have been hospitalized , but no deaths have been reported
langes client , a 70-year-old woman from florida , has filed a lawsuit against rose acre farms
she experienced vomiting , severe diarrhea and fever shortly after buying eggs from her neighborhood grocery store last march
she was taken to the emergency room on april 2 and was hospitalized for four days
the following week , she was rushed to the hospital again in an ambulance and was hospitalized for another three days , according to the complaint filed monday in federal district court in florida
lange said his client is still weak but is now recovering
a spokesman for rose acre farms said the company has no comment and is still reviewing the complaint
this is not the first time the company had problems with rodent infestation
a 2011 fda inspection found that another facility , in indiana , also was infested with rodents
in 1990 , three separate outbreaks that sickened about 450 people in three states were traced back to rose acre farms
in response , the federal government prohibited the company from selling products from three indiana farms where the contaminated eggs originated and required expensive cleanups that threatened to put the company out of business
cdc warns about salmonella infections traced to kratom
rose acre farm sued , setting off a nearly two-decade-long legal battle
a federal judge ruled that the government had overstepped its boundaries and ordered to pay the company $ 6 million
but a federal appeals court tossed out the judgment , ruling that regulations did not hurt the companys bottom line
after a few more years of back-and-forth appeals , the case was dismissed in 2009
aside from recalling eggs , rose acre farms said it is retraining its employees and has created a position called corporate sanitation manager , the indianapolis star reported
the recalled eggs were sold under brand names as such great value , country daybreak and crystal farms
recalled eggs have plant numbers of p-1065 and p-1359d , which can be found on egg cartons , and should be discarded , the fda said

the company began in indiana in the 1930s with about 1,000 hens in two poultry houses , according to its website
its founder , david rust , later began selling eggs at the indianapolis farmers market and small grocery stores
rose acre farms expanded throughout the midwest from the 1960s to the 1980s and in southeastern states in the 2000s
the company now has 17 facilities in eight states
salmonella can come from contaminated animal products such as beef , poultry , milk and eggs , as well as fruits and vegetables
it can cause fever , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain among healthy people but can lead to fatal infections among children younger than 5 , adults older than 65 and those with weak immune systems
salmonella causes about 1.2 million illnesses , 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths every year in the united states , according to the cdc
while most recover completely , some people can suffer from long-term effects such as reactive arthritis , which is joint pain and swelling caused by infection
