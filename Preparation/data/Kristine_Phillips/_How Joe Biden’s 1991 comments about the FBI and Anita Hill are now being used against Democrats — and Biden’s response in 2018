he uttered the words with visible agitation , overly enunciating at times to show emphasis
on oct. 12 , 1991 , sen. joe biden ( d-del
) , then chairman of the senate judiciary committee , said fbi investigations into sexual misconduct allegations against supreme court nominees were inconclusive
a report from such an investigation would rehash peoples versions of events without reaching a meaningful conclusion about what had actually happened , biden said
at that time , clarence thomas , nominated to the supreme court by president george h.w
bush , was facing sexual harassment allegations from anita hill , a former university of oklahoma law professor
the fbi investigated , and the senate judiciary committee heard testimony from thomas , hill and other witnesses
during one of several hearings , biden said the committee could not rely on the fbis report
you would not like it if we did , because its inconclusive , biden said to thomas , who sat stoically at a table in front of the senate panel.
they say , he said , she said and they said , period
brett kavanaugh has no good choices anymore
fast-forward to the metoo era , with another supreme court nominee now facing sexual misconduct allegations
president trumps nominee , judge brett m. kavanaugh , was all but certain to be confirmed by the republican-controlled senate until the allegations began to emerge
and as democrats called for an fbi investigation into the allegations against kavanaugh , republicans seized on the opportunity to remind them what one of their own said about such a probe nearly three decades ago
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ) tweeted tuesday night
rnc chairwoman ronna mcdaniel tweeted a few hours later
that same night , sean hannity aired a portion of bidens impassioned remarks on his fox news show and argued that the archival footage proves democrats have rejected their past reasoning about an fbi investigation
on wednesday , during a news conference at the united nations , trump himself brought up biden , after he was asked why the white house had not asked the fbi to investigate the allegations against kavanaugh
trump added also , its not for the fbi , if you look at what joe biden said
he said , they dont do this , and he said it very clearly
then , on thursday , as he opened the senate judiciary committees hearing , where ford and kavanaugh were scheduled to testify , chairman charles e. grassley ( r-iowa ) cited bidens 1991 statement
bill russo , bidens spokesman , tweeted a statement from the former vice president on friday evening chastising republicans on the judiciary committee for every effort to distort his words during the kavanaugh hearings
biden said that their blind rage and brute partisanship threaten the countrys faith in justice
doctor blasey ford gave courageous , credible and powerful testimony
i believed her
the country believed her
i am glad that members of the senate have exercised their power to advise and consent to delay further action on this nomination for a short while longer so that the fbi can do its due diligence in this nomination
i know how important the fbi 's role in nomination proceedings is
despite every effort to distort my words and record , i insisted on and got an fbi investigation twenty-seven years ago
it was the right thing to do then and it is the right thing to do now
doctor blasey ford deserves an fbi investigation today
the millions of women who have suffered sexual assault and abuse deserve an fbi investigation
the country deserves one
and for its reputation and legitimacy , the supreme court needs one too
statement from former vice president joe biden
the statement said
ronald klain , bidens chief of staff from 2009 to 2011 , said on twitter that the former vice presidents point was that the fbis purpose is to investigate , take statements from witnesses and prepare a report , as it did in 1991
the agency should do so now , he added
maybe you should listen to my ex-boss a little more carefully , klain tweeted in response to mcconnell
echoing klain , jeff peck , who was staff director of the senate judiciary committee during thomass confirmation hearings , said bidens comments in 1991 are clear and unassailable.
the fbi does not offer conclusions , and senators have not expected the agency to do so , he said
peck cited deputy attorney general rod j. rosensteins memo laying out the firing of james b. comey as fbi director
rosenstein wrote that comey had mishandled the investigation into hillary clintons emails by concluding that the case should be closed without prosecution.
it was not comeys or the fbis job to make such an announcement , rosenstein wrote
peck wrote in an email to the washington post.
the fbi investigates
senators reach conclusions and vote.
biden has been criticized for his handling of the thomas confirmation hearings , during which hill , who is black , endured skeptical and accusatory questioning from 14 white men on the senate panel
biden has since apologized and said recently that a womans public claims of assault should be presumed to be true
he also told the today show that ford should not face the character assassination to which hill was subjected
re-watching joe bidens disastrous anita hill hearing a sexual harassment inquisition
another woman , deborah ramirez , told the new yorker magazine that kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when they were both first-year students at yale university
swetnick did not say that kavanaugh sexually assaulted her , but she said she had witnessed kavanaugh and other boys getting girls drunk so they could take turns raping them during house parties
kavanaugh also told fox news that he never drank excessively during his younger years an assertion that was contradicted by former classmates who said he was frequently inebriated when he was at yale , not the choir boy he had sought to portray
in his prepared testimony for thursdays high-stakes hearing , kavanaugh acknowledged drinking and said he sometimes had too many.
