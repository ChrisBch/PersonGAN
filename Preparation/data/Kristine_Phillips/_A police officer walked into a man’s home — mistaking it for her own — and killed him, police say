investigators are still determining whether an off-duty dallas police officer , who allegedly went inside the wrong apartment by mistake and killed a man inside , should be criminally charged
dallas police chief rene hall said earlier that her department was trying to get a warrant for a manslaughter charge against the still-unnamed officer
but on saturday , hall said investigators needed more time to decipher what they described as an unusual case of a police-involved shooting that led to the death of 26-year-old botham shem jean
the officer , who has five years service , has been placed on administrative leave
after her shift ended thursday night , the officer allegedly entered what she thought was her apartment near downtown dallas
jean , who lived there , was home
authorities have not said what they think transpired inside , only saying that the officer fired her weapon
the officer called 911 , and dallas fire-rescue rushed the man to a hospital
he died shortly after
hall said during a criminal justice panel saturday
though still thin on details , the shooting has raised questions about race and prompted calls for policing restructuring
the officer is white , and jean was black
but officials caution the public about reaching certain conclusions when much is still unknown
hall said she did not know whether race was a factor or whether jean and the officer knew each other
is this a white on black crime
yes , state sen. royce west ( d-dallas ) said at a news conference saturday
is this a race-related crime
do n't know , he added
on friday , reporters pressed the police chief about the officer 's mental state when she went inside the wrong apartment whether she was fatigued or under the influence but hall did n't want to speculate
she also did not say where the officer was or whether she was in custody
so far this year , at least 694 people have been shot and killed by police , according to a washington post database on police-involved shootings
however , those cases involve officers who were on duty at the time of the shootings
