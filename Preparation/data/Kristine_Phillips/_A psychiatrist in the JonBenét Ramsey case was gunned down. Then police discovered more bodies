the following day , two paralegals were shot inside the family law office where they worked , about 10 miles away
a psychologist was found shot to death in his office hours later
ben hoster , a spokesman for the scottsdale police department , told reporters saturday that pitts killing was tied to the shooting of the two paralegals
the two women were shot just after 2 p.m. friday in a law office in downtown scottsdale , across the street from government buildings
one woman , who had been shot in the head , was able to come out of the office and flag a bus driver for help , hoster said

police followed the womans blood trail and found the second victim , hoster said
the two , veleria sharp , 48 , and laura anderson , 49 , were paralegals for burt , feldman , grenier family law firm
the washington post was unable to reach burt , feldman , grenier
in a statement to the arizona republic , the firm said
laura has worked with us as family for more than ten years
her intellect , passion and friendship has meant more to us than we can even begin to convey
she was more than a coworker , she was a friend , a mother , a grandmother , daughter and wife and gave all of herself to her family , her friends and her work
veleria was a treasured member of our work family
she brought joy , calmness , warmth and compassion to all that she did
she was a dedicated mother , wife and daughter
she and her family shared a deep passion for music and their faith.
hoster did not say how the deaths of pitt , sharp and anderson were thought to be connected or address why the three were killed
but the phoenix police department released a sketch of a man suspected of killing pitt
the last shooting was reported just after midnight saturday
police said an acquaintance found 72-year-old marshall levine , a psychologist and counselor , dead with a gunshot wound inside his office , located roughly halfway between pitts office and the law firm
hoster said investigators do not know yet whether levines death was connected to the others
