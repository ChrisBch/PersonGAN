the meeting was contentious before it even began
attendees voices grew louder as they repeatedly chanted the name of wakiesha wilson , who died two years ago while in police custody
just after the los angeles police commission meeting began tuesday morning , the boards president , steve soboroff , called a recess after a woman interrupted him and accused police officials of lying about how wilson died
wilson , 36 , was found dead inside her cell at the lapd metropolitan detention center in 2016
her death has been ruled a suicide a finding her family has rejected
at the police commission meeting , wilsons aunt , sheila hines-brim , and her mother , lisa hines , sat in the front row
hines-brim repeatedly flashed her middle finger at the officials sitting at the table in front of her , including los angeles police chief charlie beck
about 20 minutes into the meeting , after some of the attendees were told to leave because of repeated interruptions , hines-brim walked toward beck and threw a handful of a white , powdery substance in his direction
some of it landed on beck , police said
thats wakiesha , hines-brim said as she walked away
thats wakiesha
she said again , her voice louder.
shes going to stay with you

authorities later confirmed that it wasnt , though they have not determined what it was , joshua rubenstein , the police departments spokesman , said
hines-brim and another woman , melina abdullah , were booked on suspicion of battery on a police officer
the agency said abdullah , a black lives matter activist and a professor at california state university at los angeles , assaulted an officer before the meeting room was cleared
abdullah said she and hines-brim were falsely arrested
gina viola , who said she was at the meeting and was standing next to abdullah , said abdullah never touched an officer and was forcibly taken away

the following morning , she was found unconscious in her jail cell
a coroners report said she had hanged herself
her death triggered protests from her family and black lives matter activists , some of whom said wilson wouldnt have killed herself and believed that an altercation involving officers was to blame , the los angeles times reported
authorities said there was no evidence that officers used force against wilson
after her death , the department reviewed practices on when to seek mental health assistance for an inmate and how family should be notified about deaths
wilsons mother didnt find out that her daughter had died until after she had missed a court hearing , the times reported
in december , city officials agreed to pay nearly $ 300,000 to settle wrongful-death claims filed by wilsons relatives
the ruckus at the commission board meeting came two weeks after knbc reported that a detention officer was fired following wilsons death
the nbc affiliate cited internal affairs and personnel files that showed the officer , reaunna bratton , was fired late last year over allegations that she had failed to immediately render medical aid to wilson
bratton also had been accused of violating jail policies by improperly isolating wilson in an individual cell on the day she died
