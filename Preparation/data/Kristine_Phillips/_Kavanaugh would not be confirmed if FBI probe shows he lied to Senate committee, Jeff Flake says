sen. jeff flake ( r-ariz. ) said he couldnt move forward without hitting the pause button on judge brett m. kavanaughs nomination to the supreme court and , therefore , insisted on an fbi investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against the nominee
asked later in the 60 minutes interview whether the nomination would end if the probe shows that kavanaugh had not been truthful in his testimony to the senate judiciary committee , flake said as he nodded
oh , yes.
kavanaugh , a 53-year-old federal appellate court judge , has unequivocally denied allegations that as a teenager in high school , he tried to sexually assault a 15-year-old during a house party in maryland in the 1980s
the allegations by christine blasey ford , now a 51-year-old psychology professor from california , have not been corroborated by witnesses she said were present at the party
fight over kavanaugh intensifies amid confusion over limits of fbi sexual assault investigation
as the fbi investigates , a former yale university classmate accused kavanaugh of not being truthful about the extent of his drinking during his younger years
kavanaugh testified that he has never blacked out from drinking , though he acknowledged that he sometimes had too many beers.
charles ludington , who teaches at north carolina state university and said he and kavanaugh were friends in college , called the judges testimony a blatant mischaracterization of his drinking habits
the brett he knew , ludington said , was a frequent and heavy drinker who often became belligerent and aggressive when inebriated
ludington told the washington post on sunday that he plans to deliver a statement to the fbi field office in raleigh detailing kavanaughs violent drinking behavior
the allegations have disrupted kavanaughs all-but-assured nomination to the supreme court and the republicans chance to shift the judiciary to the right for decades to come
and flake , who is retiring after his term , riled the already fraught confirmation process after he announced last week that he would not vote to send kavanaugh to the supreme court unless the fbi is allowed one week to investigate
flake had initially planned to endorse kavanaugh , but he changed course after huddling with coons and other senators
he voted to send the nomination out of the committee but made his support for a senate floor vote contingent on an fbi investigation
in memo , outside prosecutor argues why she would not bring criminal charges against kavanaugh
two women who said they were sexual assault survivors confronted flake in an elevator after he announced his plan to endorse kavanaugh and tearily urged him to reconsider his position
the dramatic moment at the end of an already dramatic week was aired live on cnn
eyes were focused on flake , a key swing vote on kavanaughs nomination and a fierce critic of president trump
in his 60 minutes interview , which aired two days later , flake admitted that he would not have done what he did had he been up for reelection
no , not a chance , flake said
the 2020 race kicks into a higher gear even before the 2018 midterms are over
the 55-year-old senator announced last year that he would retire at the end of his term , citing the direction of the republican party under trump
flake said the fbi investigation will lead to additional interviews and could reveal new information
but he also acknowledged that it may further complicate matters
the investigation is not an expansive criminal probe but an additional background check on kavanaugh
the post reported that the fbi had not yet contacted ford but has spoken with a second accuser , deborah ramirez , who alleged that kavanaugh drunkenly exposed himself to her while they were in college
a u.s. official also told the post that a third accuser , julie swetnick , is not expected to be interviewed
