a pennsylvania food manufacturer is recalling 8,757 pounds of ready-to-eat salad products following an e. coli outbreak that has spread to several states and sickened dozens of people
fresh foods manufacturing , based in freedom , pa. , is recalling the prepackaged products after learning last week from their romaine lettuce supplier that the vegetables may have been contaminated with escherichia coli , the u.s. department of agriculture said saturday
officials said the recalled products have not been tied to any e. coli-related illnesses
the recalled items , which were labeled great to go by market district , were shipped to retailers in indiana , ohio , pennsylvania and west virginia and had sell-by dates of april 13 to april 16
the agency has not identified specific farms or companies that grew , supplied and distributed the contaminated vegetables
thirty-five people from 11 states have become sick 22 , including three people suffering from kidney failure , have been hospitalized , according to the centers for disease control and prevention
no one has died
health officials said these people became ill between march 22 and march 31
the majority of them reported that they ate romaine lettuce within a week before they became sick
many said they ate salads with romaine lettuce at restaurants , and these businesses told health officials that they used store-bought chopped romaine lettuce
200 million eggs recalled after nearly two dozen were sickened with salmonella , officials say
the highest number of illness was reported in idaho and pennsylvania , with eight and nine cases , respectively
seven were reported ill in new jersey
the others were in washington state , missouri , illinois , michigan , ohio , new york , virginia and connecticut
health officials in montana and arizona also said they each have three confirmed cases of e. coli infections
but the cdc , as of its latest announcement friday , has not linked those cases to romaine lettuce from arizona , a spokeswoman said
romaine lettuce is sometimes packed in the fields and shipped directly to restaurants or grocery stores
but other times , marler said , the vegetables are taken to a central processing plant , where they 're packed under different brands before they 're sent to retailers
the latter situation could make identifying the specific origin of contaminated vegetables more difficult , marler said
and we may see these numbers stack up , unfortunately.
marler said he 's representing eight people from several states who have become ill. two clients , he said , suffered kidney failures , which generally happen in a small number of cases
one woman had to undergo a blood transfusion
one man 's kidneys are not functioning at all , and he is undergoing a treatment called plasmapheresis , a procedure in which blood is separated into cells and plasma
health and food safety officials are advising consumers who have store-bought chopped romaine lettuce , including prepackaged salad mixes , to throw the vegetables away even if theyve been partially eaten
officials urge restaurants and retailers to not serve or sell romaine lettuce grown in yuma , and some have warned customers of possibly contaminated vegetables
walmart , for example , has sent emails to customers who may have bought recalled items from its stores
del taco said it has removed all salad blends from its locations
a chipotle restaurant is closed after yet another foodborne illness outbreak
the outbreak has been tied to only bagged and chopped romaine lettuce grown from the yuma region
romaine grown elsewhere and other forms of romaine , such as whole heads or hearts , are not believed to have been contaminated , according to a joint statement from industry leaders
e. coli are a type of bacteria found in undercooked beef , raw milk , soft cheeses made from raw milk , raw fruits and vegetables , and contaminated water
most e. coli bacteria are not harmful , but one type known as e. coli o157 h7 produces a toxin called shiga , which destroys red blood cells , causes kidney failure and bloody diarrhea
other kinds of e. coli cause urinary tract infections , respiratory illness and pneumonia
said shereef elnahal , commissioner of the health department in new jersey , which first reported a high number of cases
health officials said children under the age of 5 , seniors older than 65 and those with weak immune systems are most vulnerable
so far , the outbreak has sickened people ages 12 to 84
last year , products of the illinois-based soynut butter were recalled because of possible e. coli contamination
thirty-two people from a dozen states were sickened , the cdc said
the company , which produced a nut-free substitute for peanut butter , later filed for bankruptcy
in 2016 , officials said flour produced at a general mills facility in missouri may have infected as many as 63 people from two dozen states with e. coli
in 2015 , chipotle mexican grill , a restaurant chain popular for its promise to offer high-quality and sustainably sourced food , found its reputation tarnished after 60 people from 14 states were sickened with e. coli
cdc officials could not identify what type of food was the source of the bacteria , but they said that majority of the sickened people said they ate food from chipotle shortly before they became ill
the company closed 43 restaurants in washington state and oregon after health officials linked an e. coli outbreak to six restaurants in the northwest
