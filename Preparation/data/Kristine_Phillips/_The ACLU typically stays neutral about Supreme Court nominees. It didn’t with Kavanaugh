the american civil liberties union announced that it is against judge brett m. kavanaughs nomination to the supreme court , a rarity in the organizations century-long practice of not endorsing or opposing judicial candidates
the organization said this is only the fourth time in the aclus 98-year history that its board of directors voted to oppose a supreme court nominee
it did not take such action against justice neil m. gorsuch , president trumps first nominee to the high court
the aclu opposed the nomination of justice samuel a. alito jr. , in 2006 , raising concerns about his expansive view of executive authority and decisions he has written on race , religion and reproductive rights

in 1987 , the aclu opposed president ronald reagans nomination of justice robert h. bork , whom the organization saw as more radical than conservative.

in 1991 , the aclu remained neutral on the nomination of justice clarence thomas , who faced sexual harassment allegations
but its southern california chapter broke ranks with the national organization and opposed thomass nomination , citing the judges positions on affirmative action and school prayer

aclu president susan herman said in the statement
kavanaugh has forcefully denied the allegations , as well as others leveled by two named women

for example , the organization was intensely criticized last year for fighting for the rights of white nationalists to hold a rally in charlottesville
forty years ago , aclu members resigned after the organization defended the free-speech rights of a neo-nazi group to march in skokie , ill. , where many holocaust survivors lived

similarly , the organization criticized cia director mike pompeos stance on mass surveillance of americans
in the era of trump , the aclu has placed itself at the forefront of the legal battles over some of the presidents most controversial policies

it has repeatedly challenged iterations of trumps travel ban that keeps people from certain majority-muslim countries from coming to the united states
the aclu , though , has also sued trumps predecessor over similar issues of civil liberties
it sued the obama administration over its detention of asylum seekers
perhaps most notably , the organization challenged the u.s. governments surveillance program that collects the telephone records of millions of americans
