the water is everywhere flooding interstates , swamping homes and swelling rivers that keep climbing

roy cooper ( d ) said at a briefing tuesday
the storm has pummeled north carolina , leaving people here stranded at home , blocked from traveling , sweltering as they wait for the power to come on and the water to recede
florence , the storm that brought the misery , has gone from a hurricane to a tropical depression to a meandering system that dropped rain over the mid-atlantic and southern new england on tuesday , according to the national weather service
it left behind deaths in at least three states and carved an arc of destruction that had not fully become clear , though one preliminary analysis said could cost up to $ 20 billion in property losses

cooper said north carolina had confirmed a 26th death from the storm , pushing the toll to 33 lives lost so far in the carolinas and virginia , including at least three children between the ages of three months and one year old
florence and its deluge have washed out the normal contours of life across the tar heel state
cooper said more than 1,100 roads remained closed on tuesday , including interstates 95 and 40 and other major routes
images of interstate 95 released by the north carolina department of transportation showed the roadway flooded near lumberton , n.c. , and the department said there was still no safe/reliable route to or from wilmington on tuesday
more than 340,000 people still lacked electrical power , cooper said
about 10,000 people had filled the states shelters , while many others sought sanctuary with family , friends or hotels
cooper pleaded for patience , warning north carolinians that heading onto the roads could pose intense dangers
william brock long , the embattled fema administrator facing mounting questions about an investigation into his use of government vehicles , traveled to north carolina this week and met with state officials , who praised him and his agency for their assistance
long said at the news briefing with cooper , where he was asked no questions about the investigation dogging him in washington

cooper said he believed there were plans for president trump to visit on wednesday , though he noted such plans can be fluid the governor also said he would meet with the president during the visit
the national weather service said tuesday that even with florence gone , a stretch of the eastern united states spanning hundreds of miles from south carolina to virginia was still vulnerable to moderate or major flooding
according to the weather service
the highest observed rainfall total was in elizabethtown , n.c. , where just shy of 36 inches three feet of rain was reported
swansboro and gurganus both topped 30 inches , the service said
in fayetteville , city officials reported the cape fear river had reached 59 feet above hurricane matthew levels , referencing the 2016 storm that flooded north carolina by tuesday morning and was expected to crest early wednesday morning at more than 61 feet
the national weather service said a reading of the rocky rivers reach east of charlotte was unavailable because equipment had been damaged by flooding and other gauges were also damaged by debris or were plunged underwater
florences slow-motion onslaught has spurred environmental concerns , while public health officials have warned the flooding could wreak havoc on septic systems
for farmworkers and homeless , florence has been particularly harsh
the storm left people uncertain about what would come next
delores turner has been waiting for days at the eastbrook apartments in wilmington to find out when her lights would come back on , when she would be able to refill her insulin or how she would be able to keep her medication cool
turner , 76 , was on her fifth day without power and had run out of insulin tuesday morning
it was sweltering inside , flies buzzing around a refrigerator containing rotten food
turners daughter was at cvs trying to refill the insulin
even if she was able to replenish her supply , turner did not know how she would keep the medication cold
she ran out of ice two days ago
she has not heard any information from her regular pharmacy about when she will be able to replenish her other medications
turner said , holding a thin fabric fan
she kept her door and windows open but sometimes used her walker to get to the porch when the apartment became too unbearable
i think i would die in here without any air , she said
along the wall behind her couch hung a plaque dont quit.
then a pickup truck turned into the parking lot with jay young at the drivers seat and styrofoam containers of hot spaghetti in tow
he had come from compassion church in wilmington after a social worker called about turner needing help
when he walked into turners apartment and shook her hands , her eyes lit up
others headed out to try to find supplies
henrietta mckoy said she had no power at her home in the eastbrook apartment complex , so she and three friends caravanned tuesday morning to a food and water distribution site at cape fear community college
tracey tyson , who was in the car , said she had not been able to keep her insulin cold and needed to go to a hospital
tysons daughter is six months pregnant but had only been able to eat one meal a day , usually a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
the others in the car were not sure what supplies would be available and hoped for toiletries and cleaning products , because they were worried about breathing in mold
you come in my house , it smells just like the sewer , mckoy said
mckoy said she had a hard time getting to the distribution center because friends only wanted to bring her along if she had gas money
she was worried she would not be able to take supplies back to those still at the apartment complex because others might think she was hoarding supplies for herself
when mckoys nissan pulled up to the front of the distribution line , a worker yelled to ask how many supplies he could hand over between the four households
he was then told the group would only be allowed two of everything
if they needed more , they would have to come back again tomorrow
in south carolina , the rain also stopped , but jess whites problems had barely started
he lives near a swamp attached to the rising waccamaw river just outside of myrtle beach , s.c. , and his six-acre property has been flooded for days
the thigh-high waters had receded , but he expects they will rise again as the river swells , which white said could push a foot of water into his home
white said he has about two days to evacuate his neighborhood before flooding gets worse
he expects to lose his home , which has been in the family for three generations he does not have flood insurance , he said , because he could not afford it
the flooding also will impact people who prepared this week for yom kippur , the holiest day of the jewish calendar , which begins on tuesday night and continues on wednesday
in new bern , n.c. , which was battered by flooding and saw hundreds of evacuations , carla byrnes , president of temple bnai sholem , said the synagogue would be closed for the holiday
of the roughly 110 congregants from five surrounding counties , two-thirds had evacuated , byrnes said , while the temple itself had no electricity
byrnes said any remaining congregants would have to travel instead to greenville for services on the holiday , which is known as the day of atonement
im of the opinion god will forgive us , byrnes said
phillips reported from myrtle beach , s.c. , and berman reported from washington
