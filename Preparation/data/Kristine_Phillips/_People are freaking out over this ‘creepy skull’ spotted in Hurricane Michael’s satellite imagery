if youve been closely following coverage of hurricane michael , youve probably seen breathless tweets and headlines about a spooky , ominous-looking , spine-chilling skull appearing in the storms satellite images
an article by the sun , a british tabloid , even conjured an image of a haunting apparition looming near the florida panhandle
there it is , gray with a red eye
but what you probably have not seen or heard is that this creepy skull ( as accuweather described it ) means absolutely nothing
because these are moving , color-enhanced infrared images , people are bound to see patterns from the cloud formations if oriented a certain way
things that resemble something recognizable usually appear for a few minutes before they disappear , said dan lindsey , a scientist for the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations satellite program
hurricane michael live updates category 4 storm makes landfall in florida panhandle
the colors we see on infrared satellite images correspond to the temperature of the cloud tops
the colder the cloud top , the higher it is in the atmosphere and the deeper the cloud
the deeper the cloud , the stronger the storm , lindsey said
but exactly what colors are used in satellite images depends entirely on the person creating the animation
you can put really whatever enhancement you want to , lindsey said
the appearance of something skull-like in satellite images of a major storm is hardly unprecedented
during hurricane matthew in 2016 , a skull-like face with a toothy grin spooked the internet

an elephant )
