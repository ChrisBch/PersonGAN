a kansas county commissioner is facing calls for his resignation after he brought up the idea of a master race in an off-the-cuff comment while talking to a black woman during a meeting
leavenworth county commissioner louis klemp , who is white , told the woman , a kansas city city planner who was making a presentation about a development project that klemp did not seem to approve of
as klemp spoke , he motioned toward his teeth
klemps comments , made during a tuesday meeting of the leavenworth board of county commissioners , were rebuked by officials in leavenworth county , just outside kansas city
leavenworth mayor mark preisinger called a special meeting during which he denounced klemps comments and urged him to apologize to the city planner
preisinger said the comments were , at best , a poor attempt at a joke
steve king dared a conservative magazine to release audio of him calling immigrants dirt
klemp did not return a call seeking comment friday
he declined to speak to a television reporter who knocked on his door , but he implied off-camera that his comment was a joke , nbc affiliate kshb reported
the woman also did not return a call from the washington post
she told cbs affiliate kctv that she does not want to be part of the story
leavenworth county administrator mark loughry said that media accounts of klemps comments are not accurate , and that klemp meant to say he and the woman are part of a master race because they both have a gap in their front teeth
loughry said klemp has made such a reference several times in the past about people who have a gap in their teeth
two other county commissioners have also called for klemps resignation
gop senator its a great idea to make it harder for liberal folks to vote
preisinger said klemp has a history of making comments with racist overtones
last december , klemp went on a meandering monologue during a discussion about the holiday schedule and mentioned historical figures that he felt should be honored
robert e. lee , the confederate general , was a wonderful part of history , he said
he also said that his great-great grandfather owned a slave and that some black people dont support abraham lincoln , and he wondered whether oprah winfrey should have a federal holiday
( washington is honored each year , along with other presidents , on presidents day , which falls on the third monday of february
the federal government calls the holiday washingtons birthday , though it doesnt usually fall on his birthday feb. 22 and its known in many states as presidents day )
facing criticism , klemp said his comments about the holiday schedule were disappointing and lacking in clarity.
