public health officials are warning consumers not to eat store-bought , chopped romaine lettuce as an e. coli outbreak linked to the vegetable worsens
fifty-three related e. coli infections have been reported in 16 states , according to the centers for disease control and prevention
new cases were reported to the cdc in arizona , alaska , california , montana and louisiana
previously , the e. coli reports had been centered in the mid-atlantic and midwest , from connecticut to michigan
a 66-year-old woman in new jersey , louise fraser , filed a lawsuit tuesday in federal court against panera bread after claiming she ate contaminated romaine lettuce there , which sent her to the hospital for two weeks
frasers attorney , bill marler , told the washington post on sunday that he expected the number of reported illnesses nationwide to grow as officials investigate how romaine harvested from the yuma region made it to retailers and restaurants around the country
romaine lettuce is sometimes packed in the fields and shipped directly to restaurants or grocery stores
other times , marler said , the vegetables are taken to a central processing plant , where they are packed under different brand names before they are sent to retailers
the latter situation could make identifying the specific origin of contaminated vegetables more difficult , marler said
last week , fresh foods manufacturing , based in freedom , pa. , recalled 8,757 pounds of prepackaged salad products over fears that they may have been contaminated with e. coli
the recalled items were labeled great to go by market district and were shipped to retailers in indiana , ohio , pennsylvania and west virginia
retailers and restaurants , such as walmart and del taco , have warned customers who may have bought recalled products and removed all salad items from their locations
e. coli are bacteria found in undercooked beef , raw milk , soft cheeses made from raw milk , raw fruits and vegetables and contaminated water
most e. coli bacteria are not harmful , but one strain known as e. coli o157 h7 produces a toxin called shiga which destroys red blood cells and causes kidney failure and bloody diarrhea
other kinds of e. coli cause urinary tract infections , respiratory illness and pneumonia
health officials said children younger than 5 , seniors older than 65 and those with weak immune systems are most vulnerable
outbreaks of e. coli illness associated with leafy green vegetables are not new
the complaint filed on frasers behalf lists nearly 20 outbreaks from 1993 to 2011 that mostly involved romaine lettuce
in 2006 , a nationwide outbreak involving contaminated baby spinach sickened more than 200 people
other products , such as flour and nut-free substitutes for peanut butter , have been at the center of e. coli illness outbreaks in recent years
in 2015 , chipotle mexican grill , a restaurant chain popular for its promise to offer high-quality and sustainably sourced food , found its reputation tarnished after 60 people from 14 states were infected with e. coli
