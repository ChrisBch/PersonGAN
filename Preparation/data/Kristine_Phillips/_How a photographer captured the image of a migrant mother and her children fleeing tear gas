the woman grips both her daughters , one with each hand , as they run away
one child is barefoot the other is about to fall
both wear only t-shirts and diapers
the woman looks back at the smoke from the tear gas theyre trying to escape
behind them is wire fencing , a partial wall separating them from the united states , and dozens of other migrants , many of them children , also running
standing just a few feet away with a mask on , reuters photojournalist kim kyung-hoon spots the woman , who is hard to miss in her bright purple and blue-green blouse bearing characters from the movie frozen.
he snaps a picture , capturing the look on her face as she frantically tries to drag her two small children away from the gas as it spreads
the powerful image , which appeared on the websites and front pages of american news organizations , including the washington post , has provoked outrage on social media
the picture contradicts the image of violent migrants that president trump had conjured on twitter and at campaign rallies ahead of the midterm elections
i think my picture tells the story of whats happening now , the photographer told the post
why tear gas , lobbed at migrants on the southern border , is banned in warfare
kim has been following the migrants since he arrived in mexico city on nov. 14
he captured images of migrant children sitting inside a bus as they waited for some food in culiacan , mexico
he followed migrants at a gas station in navojoa , mexico , where they bathed and waited in line for food
and in mexicali , mexico , migrants piled like sardines on top of trucks as they traveled west to tijuana
the migrants arrived in tijuana several days ago and had been camped out at a sports complex not far from the u.s. border
on sunday morning , some of them began to march toward the san ysidro border crossing
they carried flags from their country , and banners that said trump we hate you not and mr trump help us please.
kim followed the group , spotting several children and people carrying strollers
a majority of the group gathered near the border peacefully , while thousands of others did not march and stayed at the sports complex
but a scuffle broke out between mexican police in riot gear and a couple of dozen protesters , with some running across a dry canal and others trying to cross through different entry points
kim recalled seeing two men try to dismantle the wire fence
u.s. officials say some threw rocks and bottles at border officers , who then fired tear gas to disperse the crowd
then kim saw the woman as she started running from the smoke , holding her 5-year-old twin daughters with both hands
her teenage daughter was running next to her , kim said
a reuters spokeswoman confirmed that the woman had traveled from honduras to mexico with all of her five children
kim followed the family as they rushed back toward tijuana , crossing a river and climbing up a concrete barrier
he said he felt the sting in his eyes and nose even with the mask on
when they got to the top , one of the twins began crying , her tiny face full of anguish as she held on to what looks like a small plastic ball
kim said the girl was pointing toward her bare feet
she had just lost her slippers
kim , who is korean , does not speak spanish and said he was able to ask the woman only where they were from
later , a colleague was able to find the family , which had returned to the sports complex
reuters learned that the woman had left honduras to reunite with her childrens father , who is in the united states , kim said
in an interview with buzzfeed news , the woman , 39-year-old maria meza , said she and her five children were standing near the fence when border agents fired tear gas at them
she said she didnt try to cross and was only looking across the border
tokyo-based kim has been a photojournalist for reuters for more than 15 years
he has covered natural disasters , and photographing protests isnt new to him he has done so many times in south korea and elsewhere in asia
but covering chaos on the other side of the globe is new
and threatening to close the border permanently
you could actually put it on your nachos and eat it , fox guest says of gas used at the mexican border
where migrants seeking asylum in the united states will stay while their claims move through u.s. courts remains unclear
trump had tweeted that migrants will not be allowed into the united states until the courts approved their claims
the post reported earlier that mexicos incoming government had agreed to let migrants stay in that country while their asylum claims are being processed
but officials backtracked after the post story prompted criticism that they were acceding to pressure from trump
they denied that an agreement had been reached and said talks with the trump administration are ongoing
