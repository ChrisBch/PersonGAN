fox newss jeanine pirro described democrats as hypocritical demons , judge brett m. kavanaugh as the former altar boy they crucified and christine blasey ford as the unknowing puppet in their cruel quest for political power
in an eight-minute opening screed on her saturday-night show , pirro said democrats or should i say demon rats are using ford to ruin the reputation of an innocent man and derail his nomination to the supreme court
and establishment republicans , she said , have all but bowed to democrats by agreeing to a new fbi background investigation of kavanaugh
flake flaked how fox news hosts reacted to the senators call for a delay on kavanaugh vote
kavanaugh is facing sexual-assault allegations that have disrupted his all-but-assured nomination to the supreme court and the republicans chance to shift the judiciary to the right for decades to come
all of this is happening just weeks before midterm elections that could dictate which party controls congress
without blatantly attacking ford even calling her a credible witness and a lovely lady pirro cast doubt on her allegations by recounting the missing and basic details that ford has acknowledged she could not remember
the four people who ford said were at the party have all said nothing happened , pirro argued , though thats not quite accurate
i was demanding a connection ana maria archila reflects on confronting jeff flake over kavanaugh nomination
ford said three other boys , mark judge , p.j
smyth and one whose name she couldnt remember , as well as her friend leland ingham keyser were at the party
none explicitly said nothing happened during that summer of 1982
judge and smyth , kavanaughs high school friends , said that they dont remember or know of the party in question and that they never witnessed the behavior ford had described during the course of their friendship with kavanaugh
keyser also said she has no recollection of the alleged party , but she said she believes ford
pirro questioned why ford came forward with her allegations more than three decades later and why kavanaughs name was not mentioned in notes from a session six years ago when ford talked to a therapist about the alleged assault
she also suggested that ford might have been hypnotized into recalling whatever traumatic event occurred , though there has been no evidence to support that
pirro , a former judge and prosecutor in westchester county , n.y. , also unloaded on sen. jeff flake ( r-ariz. ) over his 11th-hour call for an fbi investigation into the allegations against president trumps nominee
the decision delayed by another week a senate floor vote on kavanaughs confirmation
partisan rage over kavanaugh allegations erupts into midterm campaigns
flake , one of the presidents fiercest republican critics , had initially announced he would endorse the nominee
shortly afterward , two women who described themselves as sexual-assault survivors blocked flakes elevator and tearily urged him to reconsider his position
the dramatic scene in an already dramatic week unfolded live on cnn
flake called for a renewed investigation after a private meeting with democrats , angering conservatives and a cadre of fox news personalities
pirro accused flake of gutlessness , of balking after two women screamed at him , though its unclear what exactly caused flakes last-minute change of heart
she also addressed one of the women who confronted the senator
pirro is known for her controversial remarks and fiery personality
in july , she and the view co-host whoopi goldberg yelled at each other on live television
pirro is also among trumps most ardent defenders on cable news , which the president watches regularly
