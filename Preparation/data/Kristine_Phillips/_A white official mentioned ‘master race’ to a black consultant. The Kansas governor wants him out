add the kansas governor to the list of people who say they believe a county commissioners master race comments to a black city planner were nazi-tinged , racist and crossed the line not a bizarre , orthodontic-themed joke that somehow landed wrong
the comment in question was made at a county commissioners meeting tuesday in leavenworth , just outside kansas city
leavenworth county commissioner louis klemp apparently had taken issue with a development project presented by a planning consultant , who also happened to be the only black person in the video filmed during the meeting
klemp , who is white , told triveece penelton
since that meeting , several city and county officials have called for klemp to resign
on saturday , republican gov
jeff colyer joined the chorus
leavenworth mayor mark preisinger called a special meeting during which he denounced klemps comments and urged him to apologize to the county planner
leavenworth city commission denounces county commissioner louis klemps racist comments , asks him to resign
for his part , klemp has not publicly defended his comments
klemp could not be reached for comment sunday
he declined on wednesday to speak to a television reporter who knocked on his door , but he implied off-camera that his comment was a joke , nbc affiliate kshb reported
penelton also did not return a call from the washington post
she told cbs affiliate kctv that she does not want to be part of the story
leavenworth county administrator mark loughry defended klemp , saying the commissioner has made similar comments about people who have a gap in their teeth
klemp , loughry said , meant that he and the woman are part of the master race
but that explanation excluded the 779 million or so google hits for master race , namely adolf hitlers belief that blond , blue-eyed and tall aryans were the superior race , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum
it was more than a belief system german scientists began a program of forced sterilizations of people they considered inferior ethnic minorities , the physically disabled , the mentally ill and jews
klemps comments did not happen in a vacuum
in december , a month after he was appointed to fill a vacancy on the commission , he went on a meandering , disjointed soliloquy about a number of racially incendiary topics slavery , the civil war , the rev
martin luther king jr. and exactly which historical figures are deserving of a national holiday
according to the kansas city star , klemp said his great-grandfather owned slaves and president lincolns legacy wouldnt be fully realized because of the outcome of the civil war
he also took umbrage with the fact that king has a federal holiday all to himself while george washington has to share presidents day
facing criticism , klemp said his comments about the holiday schedule were disappointing and lacking in clarity.
