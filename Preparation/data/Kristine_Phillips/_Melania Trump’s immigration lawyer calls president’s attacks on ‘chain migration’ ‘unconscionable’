first lady melania trumps immigration attorney is criticizing the presidents hostility toward chain migration a process by which u.s. citizens or permanent residents can sponsor family members to come to the country and said the attacks are unconscionable.
michael wildes told cnn on friday
wildes , a high-profile attorney who has worked for numerous celebrities on immigration cases , represented the first ladys parents , who became naturalized citizens thursday
viktor and amalija knavs left their native slovenia and had been living in the united states as permanent residents
melania trumps parents become naturalized u.s. citizens despite the presidents hostility toward chain migration
its the same process of legal immigration that president trump has derided as chain migration and which he has called to end
it 's unconscionable
- michael wildes , immigration lawyer for melania trump and her family , reacts to trump 's chain migration attacks , something he says actually is a beautiful bedrock of immigration law and policy called family reunification
trump has claimed that chain migration has resulted in national security threats , even though studies have shown that immigrants , both legal and undocumented , are less likely to commit crimes than native-born americans
in several speeches and interviews over the past months , trump has called chain migration terrible and a disaster.
he has also claimed , falsely as the posts fact checker found , that the process allowed a terror suspect to bring two dozen relatives to the country
you bring one person in , you end up with 32 people , he said at one news conference
he said at another
responding to the presidents comments , clips of which were played in succession during the interview , wildes denounced claims that chain migration allows people to simply bring in any relative to the united states
wildes , a staunch democrat who is running for a third term as mayor of englewood , n.j. , has previously criticized the presidents policies on immigration
among his other clients have been british singer boy george and french chef jean-georges
melania trumps parents are legal permanent residents , raising questions about whether they relied on chain migration
under u.s. law , citizens can sponsor their spouses , children , parents and siblings so that they can come to the united states
rules are stricter for permanent residents or green-card holders , who can sponsor only a spouse or unmarried children
the process often takes years and often has a lengthy waiting list
nearly 4 million applicants were on the waiting list as of last november
both melania trump and the presidents first wife , ivana , came to the country as immigrants
ivana trump , born in the former czechoslovakia , became a naturalized citizen in 1988
the white house did not respond to a request for comment about wildess remarks
stephanie grisham , a spokeswoman for melania trump , had previously declined to comment about the first ladys parents because theyre not part of the administration
the president in december called for ending chain migration and the visa lottery system , after uzbekistan-born sayfullo habibullaevic saipov allegedly killed eight people and injured a dozen others in an attack in manhattan
the lottery system , which allowed saipov to come to the u.s. , is a process in which up to 50,000 immigrant visas are drawn annually from a random selection of applications from countries with low rates of immigration to the country
