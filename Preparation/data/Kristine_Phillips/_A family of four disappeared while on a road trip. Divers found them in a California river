investigators have found and identified the bodies of four family members , including two young children , who vanished while on a road trip from oregon to california
the discovery followed more than a week of search efforts for sandeep thottapilly , his wife , soumya , and their children , who disappeared while traveling to meet with family members in san jose
witnesses in mendocino county the same northern california locality where another family died last month after their car was possibly driven off a cliff reported seeing an suv being swept away in a river
a poster shared by friends and relatives on social media suggested that the suv description matched the thottapilly familys vehicle
on sunday , searchers found the bodies of 41-year-old sandeep thottapilly and his 9-year-old daughter , saachi , inside the vehicle that was submerged in the eel river
the smell of gasoline coming from the water led divers to the vehicle , which was covered in sediment and resting at least four feet underwater , according to the mendocino county sheriffs office
investigators also have identified a body recovered last week as sandeep thottapillys wife , 38-year-old soumya
the couples son , 12-year-old siddhant , was found monday about six miles from where the suv fell into the river

they had been traveling from portland , ore. , and were supposed to meet with relatives in san jose the following day before going back to their home in santa clarita , calif. , just outside los angeles
but the thottapillys never made it to san jose and were later reported missing , police said
the poster shared on facebook described the familys vehicle as a maroon or burgundy 2016 honda pilot
on april 6 , witnesses reported seeing a similar-looking vehicle falling off a steep embankment and into the eel river off u.s. route 101 near leggett , a small camping and hiking destination in northern california , authorities said
searchers found car parts and determined that they came from a maroon honda pilot
search-and-rescue efforts were initially hampered by heavy rainfall that caused the eel river to swell and be clouded by mud and debris , officer william wunderlich of the california highway patrol told the los angeles times
the incident happened about 30 miles from the area where another familys suv plunged 100 feet down a cliff off the scenic pacific coast highway and into the ocean
the crash killed a married couple , jennifer jean hart and sarah margaret hart , both 38 , and at least three of their six children
the other three are feared to be dead
investigators said that vehicle may have been intentionally driven off the cliff
