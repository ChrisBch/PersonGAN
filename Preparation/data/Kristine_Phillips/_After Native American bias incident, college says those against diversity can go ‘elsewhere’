two suspicious young men joined a colorado universitys campus tour to which they did not belong , a woman told a 911 dispatcher
they refused to say their names , she said , and one of them started to laugh when she asked what they wanted to study
they were lying the whole time , the woman , a mother of another student on the tour , concluded
they just really stand out , she added , judging from their odd behavior and dark clothing with weird symbolism or wording on it.
and one of them is for sure hispanic because he said hes from mexico
contrary to what the woman had suspected , the young men were part of the campus tour
they showed police an email to prove it
they got lost and arrived 45 minutes late
after seeing the young men on the tour , the woman called 911
body camera footage showed the shaggy-haired teens timidly answering questions from police officers
they were told to keep their hands visible
they were patted down because the woman had said one of them had his hand in the pocket of his oversize jacket
they were wearing black clothing , but that weird symbolism was metal band logos
one was that of a band called cattle decapitation , whose songs protest mistreatment of animals , their mother said
they told police the woman who was suspicious of them had asked for their names , but they did not say much because they are shy
as their mother would later say , they hadnt had much experience in the outside world
two native american brothers were touring a colo. college when a parent called police
they say it was racial profiling
by the time police let them rejoin the tour , they had already been left behind
they drove back home
days after the april 30 incident , which school officials have described as the result of bias , colorado state university president tony frank wrote a lengthy and sobering apology
frank wrote friday.
the very idea that someone anyone might look like they dont belong on a csu admissions tour is anathema
people of all races , gender , identities , orientations , cultures , religion , heritages , and appearances belong here.
anyone who is uncomfortable with a diverse and inclusive academic environment should find another campus elsewhere , frank added
the brothers said their experience fits a pattern of racial profiling
the incident comes after a raft of similar situations have thrown a spotlight on racial bias and perceptions in recent weeks , the washington posts kyle swenson wrote
in april , two young black men who had arrived early at a philadelphia starbucks for a business meeting wound up leaving the coffee shop in handcuffs
days later , two black men were wrongly accused of not paying to use an la fitness gym in secaucus , n.j. , the posts rachel siegel reported
thomas gray , a student at northern new mexico college , told the associated press that he and his brother kept to themselves the whole time.
i guess that was scaring people , he said , that we were just quiet.
the teens mother , lorraine kahneratokwas gray , said listening to her son recount the experience reminded her of an encounter between an officer and a black man.
unfortunately in that incident , the man was shot and killed by the officer , lorraine gray wrote on facebook
i am lucky my sons are both still alive , she said
in a lengthy message to lorraine gray , the tour guide said she did not believe the young men were suspicious and apologized for not realizing what had happened until later
two black men arrested at starbucks settle with philadelphia for $ 1 each
a police report and audio of the 911 call were redacted and edited to avoid identifying the caller , who was described as a white female
during the 911 call , the woman repeatedly told the dispatcher that she had never called 911 on anyone before and , perhaps , she was just being completely paranoid.
after the incident , lorraine gray called campus police and told the officer that she felt her sons had been racially profiled , according to the police report
the officer told gray that police are obligated to follow up on any call they receive and that the caller was suspicious because of the boys actions alone.
but in his message to the campus community , frank , the president , urged everyone to reflect on their own biases against people who dont look like them
and that call for self-reflection includes him , frank said , a white man in a position of authority.
