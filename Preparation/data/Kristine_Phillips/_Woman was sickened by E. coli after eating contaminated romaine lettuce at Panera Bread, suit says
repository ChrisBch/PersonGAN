a 66-year-old woman who was sickened by e. coli is suing panera bread after apparently eating contaminated romaine lettuce at a restaurant in new jersey
louise fraser first experienced abdominal pain within days of eating at a restaurant in somerset county , according to a federal complaint
then came bloody diarrhea and vomiting that sent her to the emergency room march 25
doctors diagnosed hemolytic uremic syndrome , a life-threatening illness that happens to a small number of people infected with escherichia coli and can lead to kidney failure
the food and drug administration has not identified specific farms or companies that grew , supplied and distributed the contaminated products
according to fraser 's lawsuit , filed tuesday in federal court in new jersey , ohio-based freshway foods supplied contaminated lettuce to panera bread
a spokeswoman for freshway foods , which fraser also sued , said she can not comment on pending litigation
panera bread 's media office has not responded to an email requesting comment
fraser 's lawsuit comes amid an outbreak of e. coli illness that has spread to several states and sickened dozens of people
federal officials say the outbreak was caused by bagged and pre-chopped romaine lettuce grown in the yuma , ariz. , region , near the border to southern california , and distributed to retailers and restaurants across the country
according to the complaint , fraser , of flemington , n.j. , was hospitalized for more than two weeks and underwent multiple blood transfusions , among several treatments
i would n't wish this on my worst enemy , fraser told nj.com
she did not return a call tuesday
thousands of pounds of prepackaged salad mixes may have been tainted with e. coli , officials say
her attorney , bill marler , said a possible link was identified between panera bread and e. coli cases from multiple counties
a spokeswoman for new jersey 's health department did not comment on questions about panera bread , but county officials told nj.com they are investigating a cluster of e. coli illness cases that are potentially linked to local panera bread restaurants
marler said he expects the number of reported illnesses nationwide to grow as officials investigate how romaine harvested from the yuma region made it to retailers and restaurants around the country
romaine lettuce is sometimes packed in the fields and shipped directly to restaurants or grocery stores
other times , marler said , the vegetables are taken to a central processing plant , where they are packed under different brands before they are sent to retailers
the latter situation could make identifying the specific origin of contaminated vegetables more difficult , marler said
last week , fresh foods manufacturing , based in freedom , pa. , recalled 8,757 pounds of prepackaged salad products over fears they may have been contaminated with e. coli
the recalled items were labeled great to go by market district and were shipped to retailers in indiana , ohio , pennsylvania and west virginia
no one has died
health officials said these people became ill between march 22 and march 31
the majority reported they ate romaine lettuce within a week before they became sick
many said they ate salads with romaine lettuce at restaurants , and these businesses told health officials they used store-bought chopped romaine lettuce
200 million eggs recalled after nearly two dozen were sickened with salmonella , officials say
the highest number of illness was reported in idaho and pennsylvania , with eight and nine cases , respectively
seven were reported ill in new jersey
the others were in washington state , missouri , illinois , michigan , ohio , new york , virginia and connecticut
health officials in montana and arizona also said they each have confirmed cases of e. coli infections
the cdc , as of its latest announcement last week , has not linked those cases to romaine lettuce from arizona , a spokeswoman said
retailers and restaurants , such as walmart and del taco , have warned customers who may have bought recalled products and removed all salad items from their locations
e. coli are bacteria found in undercooked beef , raw milk , soft cheeses made from raw milk , raw fruits and vegetables and contaminated water
most e. coli bacteria are not harmful , but one type known as e. coli o157 h7 produces a toxin called shiga , which destroys red blood cells , and causes kidney failure and bloody diarrhea
other kinds of e. coli cause urinary tract infections , respiratory illness and pneumonia
health officials said children younger than 5 , seniors older than 65 and those with weak immune systems are most vulnerable
so far , the outbreak has sickened people ages 12 to 84
outbreaks of e. coli illness associated with leafy green vegetables are not new
the complaint filed on fraser 's behalf lists nearly 20 outbreaks from 1993 to 2011 that mostly involved romaine lettuce
in 2006 , a nationwide outbreak involving contaminated baby spinach sickened more than 200 people
other products , such as flour and nut-free substitute for peanut butter , have been at the center of e. coli illness outbreaks in recent years
in 2015 , chipotle mexican grill , a restaurant chain popular for its promise to offer high-quality and sustainably sourced food , found its reputation tarnished after 60 people from 14 states were infected with e. coli
