pictures of rebecca zeni during her younger years showed her with flawless skin , well-defined eyebrows and long , thick lashes
her hair , parted in the middle , was neatly tied with a bow behind her ear
her beauty could capture a room , her daughter said , but she was more than just a beautiful face
she was a modern-day woman of the 1940s and 1950s , headstrong , career-oriented and hard-working , said mike prieto , a lawyer representing zenis family
at a time when women were expected to marry young and have children , the small-town girl from north carolina moved to norfolk after high school to work at the naval base there , her daughter , pamela puryear , said
she later became a model in new york city and worked as an assistant for cbs newss mike wallace before she married and became a stay-at-home mother
but the once-vibrant woman later found herself living in a nursing home , where she suffered a long , painful death , her familys attorneys said
parasitic mites had burrowed under her skin , living and laying eggs all over her body
by the time she died , vesicles and thick crusts had formed on her skin
her right hand had turned nearly black , and prieto said her fingers were about to fall off
the scabies that infected zenis body had become so severe that bacteria seeped into her bloodstream
she died in 2015 at age 93
zenis death is now the subject of a lawsuit filed against pruitthealth , a for-profit company that owns dozens of nursing homes , including shepherd hills in lafayette , ga. , where zeni lived for five years until she died
shepherd hills , a nursing home that had multiple scabies outbreaks in recent years and a history of health violations , failed to follow policies and procedures to prevent the occurrence and spread of the highly contagious disease , documents say
instead of providing the care that zeni desperately needed , the lawsuit alleges that the nursing home allowed her to die an agonizing death
she was literally being eaten alive from inside out.
zenis death raises crucial and familiar questions about for-profit nursing homes that have long been accused of sacrificing patient care to minimize costs and maximize bottom lines
staffing levels are usually lower , meaning trained nurses spend less time with residents each day
avi mukherjee , a professor at marshall university who focuses on health-care management , said high staff turnovers , diminishing morale , and meager pay and benefits often result in low quality of care
pruitthealths spokesman and attorneys did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment
federal health inspection records paint a troubling picture of the company , which describes itself as the regional leader of providing long-term health care to the elderly in the southeast
shepherd hills was ordered to pay $ 337,786 in penalties over the past two years and has a one-star rating the lowest from medicare based on health inspection results , staffing and quality of care
in 2016 , for example , the facility was penalized for several staff medication errors , some of which resulted in life-threatening situations
one resident was mistakenly given morphine twice within a half-hour one morning and continued to receive the medication every two hours later that night and the following day , records show
the resident overdosed and was rushed to the intensive care unit
that year , state officials threatened to withhold federal funding and to impose monetary penalties if violations were n't addressed , state records show
many pruitthealth-owned facilities have similarly dismal records
nineteen other facilities in georgia , seven in south carolina and one in north carolina received one- and two-star ratings from medicare
according to the government accountability offices 2016 report to congress , skilled nursing facilities received $ 28.6 billion in federal funds in 2014
about 70 percent of these facilities are for-profit nursing homes
zeni was admitted to shepherd hills in 2010
by then , the 87-year-old had been diagnosed with dementia , diabetes and other illnesses
she was completely dependent on others and was no longer legally qualified to stay at an assisted-living facility
puryear , who lives in lafayette , was close enough to visit often
zenis rashes began to appear in fall 2013 , around the time that a scabies outbreak at the facility was reported to the local health department
ten residents and 10 staffers had rashes some were diagnosed with scabies , according to georgia department of public health records
attorneys for puryear said the nursing home did not take the necessary steps to keep the outbreak contained and to properly treat residents
sheets used by those infected were washed along with those of the general population , and medication was shared among residents
families were not informed of the highly contagious disease , said attorney stephen chance instead , vague signage about a rash was posted at the facility
residents with scabies were not quarantined , and infected staffers returned to work
said attorney lance lourie
another outbreak occurred in 2014 , chance said , but that was not reported to the health department
a third outbreak happened in spring 2015
twenty residents and 15 staffers were infected , state records show
by then , zenis condition had dramatically worsened
rashes had spread to her scalp , neck , chest , shoulders , back and arms
a doctor had ordered that she be given ivermectin , a tablet used to treat worm infections , and elimite cream , which is used to treat scabies
but the treatments and medications were at times not given as ordered , court records say
zeni died june 2 , 2015
an autopsy found that she died of staphylococcus aureus septicemia due to norwegian crusted scabies , a severe form of scabies that affects people with weak immune systems , such as the elderly
scabies can spread rapidly in crowded places , such as nursing homes , extended-care facilities and prisons , according to the state health department
an affidavit by debi luther , a florida nurse who reviewed zenis medical records , stated that the nursing homes failure to recognize her deteriorating condition and to prevent the spread of scabies resulted in her death
nancy nydam , spokeswoman for the georgia health department , said the agency provides guidelines to prevent and control scabies outbreaks and follows up with facilities , but it does not have regulatory control
a separate agency , the georgia department of community health , inspects facilities and could set rules that a facility must follow
spokeswoman fiona roberts said the agency was not notified of the scabies outbreaks
prieto , one of the attorneys , said of puryear
puryear said she watched helplessly as she visited her mother every day , unable to touch or hug the woman she loved and admired
its a nightmare , she said , adding later there was no dignity.
