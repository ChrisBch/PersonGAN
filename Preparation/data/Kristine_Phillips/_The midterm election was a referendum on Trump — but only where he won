a vote for morrisey is a vote for me , trump said in west virginia of state attorney general patrick morrisey , who was defeated by incumbent sen. joe manchin iii
now , the results of the midterm election are clear voters in rural areas and deep-red states elected trump-endorsed senate candidates in indiana , missouri , north dakota , texas and tennessee an affirmation of the presidents ability to rally his base.
i won the senate , he told chris wallace on fox news sunday.
but voters in urban and suburban areas , including in several swing states that voted for trump in 2016 , recoiled from him by rejecting republicans in the house
in the same interview sunday with the fox news anchor , trump said republicans lost because he was not the candidate
i wasnt on the ballot , he said to wallace
never mind that the president spent weeks telling voters that the midterm elections were about him
i am on the ticket trump seeks to make the election about him , even if some dont want it to be
when confronted with the post-midterm reality , the president seems to want to have it both ways
he basks in victories his victories
but he glosses over the losses , which were not his losses because , as he said , he was not on the ballot
( reminder pretend im on the ballot , trump said a month ago )
the midterm election was a referendum on trump but only where he won
he said of the florida governor who narrowly ousted democrat sen. bill nelson after several tumultuous days of recounts and evidence-free claims of voter fraud
in georgia i was the one that went for brian , and brian won , he said , referring to brian kemp , who defeated democrat stacy abrams in a hard-fought and contentious gubernatorial race
he said of mike dewine , who defeated democrat richard cordray in the gubernatorial race
house candidates campaign on their agendas , but voters vote on trump
poll after poll showed that trump was among the top factors people thought about as they voted on nov. 6
the washington post and schar school of policy and government at george mason university polled voters in 69 battleground congressional districts to see what they thought , how they felt and how they voted on and before election day
forty-two percent of those polled said trump is either the most important or the second most important issue on the vote , along with health care
a fox news exit poll found that 63 percent of more than 116,000 voters said trump was a factor in their vote
a cnn exit poll of more than 18,000 voters found that 95 percent of republicans said their vote for the u.s. house was to support trump , while 94 percent of democrats said their vote was to oppose him
in many of the battleground congressional districts , including in areas that trump narrowly won in 2016 , candidates tried to campaign on their agenda , but the presidents shadow loomed so large that it obscured everything else
for some republican candidates , winning meant being as trumpian as they could possibly be and gambling on the trump vote in a year when that vote , however enthusiastic , generated an equally enthusiastic opposition
for some , like newly elected florida gov
ron desantis , who appeared in an ad helping his daughter build the wall , it paid off
for others , like the republicans in orange county , it didnt
