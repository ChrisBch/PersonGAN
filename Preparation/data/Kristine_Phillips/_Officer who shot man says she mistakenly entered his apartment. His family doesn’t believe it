dallas police officer amber guyger said she thought there was a burglar inside her apartment
the room was unlit , the front door was ajar , and she saw a large silhouette inside , according to court documents
the officer drew her service weapon at the supposed burglar , shouted commands she said were ignored , and pulled the trigger , killing her neighbor the man who actually lived there
but family members of the man , botham jean , 26 , disputed the officer 's account of the fatal shooting that has led to a protest and become a rallying cry against police brutality
dallas civil rights lawyer lee merritt , who represents jean 's family , said the officer 's claim that she had mistakenly entered the wrong apartment after coming home from a shift is inconsistent with evidence
merritt told the washington post
guyger , 30 , was arrested on a manslaughter charge sunday , three days after jean was killed
the delay raised questions about why investigators held off on arresting the officer and about whether law enforcement authorities were showing deferential treatment for one of their own
on monday night , dozens of protesters marched from the police department headquarters near downtown dallas to the apartment building just a few blocks away , chanting jean 's name
what 's his name
a protest leader with a megaphone said
botham jean
the rest responded
despite the arrest , jean 's mother , allison jean , said several questions remain unanswered
dallas police officer arrested days after she killed a man in his apartment
the court documents released monday offered the first official account of the shooting that of the officer 's
guyger arrived home just before 10 p.m. thursday and parked her car on the fourth level of the apartment building garage , which corresponds to the floors where residents live
she tried to use her door key , which has an electronic chip , to open the apartment , but the door was already unlocked , documents say
she saw the large silhouette across the room , and fired her handgun twice after jean allegedly ignored her verbal commands , striking him once in the torso
guyger called 911 , turned on the lights and saw the apartment number on the front door 1478
her apartment is directly below , 1378
a video taken from the building shows the officer on the phone , pacing back and forth outside the apartment and crying
paramedics were later seen moving a man on a gurney and performing cpr on him
merritt , the attorney , said that based on his conversations with police officials , there was probable cause to arrest guyger on a manslaughter charge
but , he said , investigators with the texas ranger division , a separate state agency that took over the case , told him they wanted more evidence
dallas police chief rene hall said that her office was in the process of obtaining an arrest warrant last week but that it was postponed after the texas ranger division asked for additional time to investigate after interviewing guyger
a grand jury will ultimately decide the final charges against the officer and could consider charges such as murder , a first-degree felony , or the lesser charge of manslaughter , a second-degree felony
some of the protesters called for a murder charge
lashadion shemwell told nbc affiliate kxas-tv
a police officer walked into a mans home mistaking it for her own and killed him , police say
nobody was injured in the protest , which lasted a few hours , according to media reports
dallas county district attorney faith johnson vowed thoroughness and fairness as her office prepares to present the case to the grand jury
guyger , who has been with the police department for four years and is now on administrative leave , has been released on $ 300,000 bail
the texas department of public safety , which oversees the rangers , declined to comment beyond a brief news release announcing guyger 's arrest
the district attorney 's office did not respond to a request for comment
the dallas police association was not immediately available to comment tuesday
jean , an accountant , was a native of the small caribbean island of st. lucia
merritt , the family attorney , said jean moved to arkansas , where he attended harding university , and later became a naturalized u.s. citizen
jean was described as a man who loved god and worshiped through singing
dallas mayor mike rawlings said he was a model citizen
jean 's death has placed the national spotlight back on a city that , just two years ago , lost five police officers in a shooting
a gunman , who said he wanted to kill white people , especially white officers , opened fire during a peaceful protest of police shootings
it also has reignited questions about police brutality against black men , although hall , the police chief , said she does n't know whether race played a role in jean 's death
