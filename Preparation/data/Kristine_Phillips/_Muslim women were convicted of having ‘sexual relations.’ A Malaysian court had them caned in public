two women were caned in front of an audience in a malaysian court for trying to have sex , spurring condemnation from human rights groups and calls to abolish corporal punishment in the predominantly muslim southeast asian country
the unnamed muslim women , ages 22 and 32 , were each struck six times with the cane monday in the syariah high court in the malaysian state of terengganu , the star reported
the women , who had pleaded guilty to having sexual relations between women , were led to a stool , and two female officers took turns striking them in the back
the older woman did not wince , according to the newspaper , while the younger one sobbed
the punishments came amid the new malaysian government 's rising rhetoric against homosexuality and follows weeks of attacks against members of the lgbt community
about 150 people were reportedly inside the courtroom during the caning
representatives of the terengganu government said the punishments , which the star newspaper described not as whipping but as a forceful tap , were meant to educate and not inflict pain

the sentencing went smoothly and did not cause the accused any harm
satiful bahri mamat , a member of the terengganu state executive council , said the punishment was the first to be carried out in a public setting
sharia criminal procedure allows the court to determine where the sentence will be carried out , and requires that it must be witnessed by a number of other muslims , satiful told reuters , referring to islamic law
he added the reason it is carried out in public is for it to serve as a lesson to society
george varughese , president of the malaysian bar , said such punishments are barbaric and inflict lasting psychological harm
the malaysian bar unreservedly opposes corporal punishment , including caning
under international human rights law , corporal punishment constitutes a form of torture , varughese said in a statement calling for an immediate moratorium on all forms of corporal punishment.
there is empirical evidence to show that it has failed as a retributory and deterrent sentence

who gets to define it
people should not live in fear because of who they are and who they love the malaysia authorities must immediately repeal repressive laws , outlaw torturous punishments and ratify the un convention against torture , chhoa-howard said in a statement
one would think that such a sentence would only be meted out in saudi arabia , santiago said in a statement
the women were punished after they were seen engaging in sexual activity in a car , santiago said
we need to stop targeting the lgbt community
we need to stop invading their privacy
we need to stop abusing them
we need to grow up as a society and learn to embrace diversity , he said
the new government , he added , was voted in on the premise of inclusion and must repeal laws that criminalize homosexuality
the women were sentenced aug. 12
they were also fined roughly $ 800
