at 8:15 a.m. on aug. 6 , 1945 , the united states dropped the first combat atomic bomb , little boy.
it exploded 43 seconds later , creating a massive fireball that incinerated much of hiroshima
nearly 350,000 people were in the japanese city that day , and most were civilians
twenty-seven years later , a scientist from across the pacific ocean arrived in hiroshima with what was considered then a novel idea
brazilian physicist srgio mascarenhas , at the time a visiting professor at harvard university , said that exposure to radiation makes human bone magnetic , and that magnetic memory existed in the bones of atomic bombing victims years after the explosion
scientists could measure radiation exposure by examining the bones of victims , mascarenhas proposed
with the help of two japanese scientists in hiroshima , mascarenhas obtained several samples of victims bones , including a jawbone that belonged to a person who was less than a mile away from ground zero
they were able to estimate the amount of radiation present in the bones , according to a paper mascarenhas presented to the american physical society meeting in april 1973 in washington , but specific calculations could not be achieved with 1970s technology
the former soviet officer who trusted his gut and averted a global nuclear catastrophe
mascarenhas brought the samples home to brazil , where they sat in storage for the next four decades until two other brazilian scientists continued his research using more advanced technology
the result was astonishing
using a technique called electron spin resonance , the researchers measured that the jawbone had absorbed 9.46 grays of radiation from the hiroshima attack
( a gray or gy is a unit used to measure the amount of radiation absorbed by an object or a person )
to place this in context a cancer patient receiving radiotherapy treatment is exposed to about 2 to 3 grays on a very localized part of the body where a tumor is located
whole-body radiation with about 5 grays nearly half of the amount calculated from the jawbone is enough to kill a person , oswaldo baffa , one of the researchers and a professor at the university of so paulo , told the washington post tuesday
teeth have been used to measure the amount of radiation a person had been exposed to
in 1997 , scientists from taiwan measured the radiation dose that patients with nasopharyngeal cancer ( in which cancer cells form near the throat behind the nose ) had absorbed from radiotherapy by examining their jawbones
but the researchers in brazil said this is the first time that bones were used to precisely measure the amount of radiation absorbed by atomic bombing victims
according to the research paper published in february by the public library of science
the researchers said their findings are timely and significant , given the risk of terrorist attacks in some countries , including the united states
the research , borne out of mascarenhass earlier findings , was the postdoctoral work of baffas former student , angela kinoshita , now a professor at university of the sacred heart in brazil
an illustrated history of the hiroshima and nagasaki nuclear bombings
the sample , which had been stored in a box in a laboratory , was first washed and oven-dried
a portion of the sample was then crushed with a mortar and pestle
the researchers exposed several portions of the sample to certain amounts of radiation
using a spectrometer and computer software and a combination of different techniques , they calculated the amount of radiation that the victim was exposed to in 1945
the post was unable to reach mascarenhas , who is nearing his 90s and has retired
but , his research is not over , he told the brazilian science news site
well have news in a few months.
between 90,000 and 166,000 people died after the hiroshima bombing
another 60,000 to 80,000 died in nagasaki , where the united states dropped a second atomic bomb on aug. 9 , 1945
