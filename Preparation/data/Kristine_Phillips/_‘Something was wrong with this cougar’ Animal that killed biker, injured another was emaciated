brooks and isaac sederbaum did what they were supposed to do , authorities say
they made loud noises to scare the cougar away
one of them even struck the animal with a bicycle
but none of it worked
the big cat that had been following the two friends as they were mountain biking in rural washington state pounced , lunging at sederbaums head and killing brooks , whom the animal mauled in its den
the attacks saturday morning the first fatal one in the state in nearly a century was uncharacteristic of cougars , which are normally solitary animals that run off when confronted by humans , said capt
alan myers of the washington department of fish and wildlife
the adult male cougar stalked the cyclists , and instead of running away after the victims tried to scare it off , the animal returned and attacked them
humans are not on the menu for cougars normally , myers told the washington post
for it to attack two human beings in the manner that it did was incredibly abnormal
they do everything they can to avoid human contact
cougars also usually hunt at night
the attack on the bikers happened in broad daylight , just after 11 a.m. saturday
something was wrong with this cougar , sgt
ryan abbott , spokesman for the king county sheriffs office , told the associated press
cougar kills mountain biker , injures another in rare attack outside seattle
myers said a preliminary examination of the animal , which has been euthanized , revealed that the 3- to 4-year-old , 100-pound male cougar was slightly emaciated
adult male cougars usually weigh 140 to 180 pounds
its unknown what would cause cougars to behave violently against humans
brooks , 32 , and sederbaum , 31 , were mountain biking on a dirt road near north bend , a foothills town 30 miles from seattle when they realized that a cougar was chasing them
they managed to drive the cat away , at least at first , by making loud noises something that authorities recommend people do during such encounters
the cougar ran toward the bushes after one of the victims swung a bicycle at it , abbott said
but just as the two were about to leave , the cougar jumped back and pounced on sederbaum , holding his head with its jaw and shaking him from side to side
at one point , brooks got off the bike and ran away , catching the attention of the big cat , whose instinct was to chase
injured and bloodied , sederbaum hopped on his bike and rode away
he looked back and saw the cougar dragging his friend into the woods , abbott said

dfw tracked down and euthanized the mountainlion
sederbaum rode about two miles to find cell reception and called 911
he suffered deep cuts and tears around his head and throughout his body , myers said
his cheek was torn open
he was taken harborview medical center in seattle , where his condition was later upgraded to satisfactory , according to media reports
first responders from the fire and sheriffs departments found brooks in the cougars den , with the cougar on top of him , abbott said
one of the deputies fired a shot , scaring the animal away
officers with the washington department of fish and wildlife used hounds to track the cougar , which they found behind a tree 80 feet away , abbott said
brooks was brutally mauled , myers said
friends said brooks was an avid cyclist who moved from boston to seattle not long ago and immediately fell in love with the outdoors
tyler gillies said brooks had been leading cycling trips in the past year to the remote area where the attack occurred
i have so many friends that ride out there all the time , gillies told kiro
i do the same thing myself
it is a perfectly safe and wonderful thing to do
was in the wrong place at the wrong time , and im just crushed
tom fucoloro , a writer for seattle bike blog , said brooks had created a local bike community in which women , transgender people and others can feel welcome
people couldnt believe two dogs killed their owner
so the sheriff described the horror
a lot of women , especially women of color , would go into bike shops and have a bad experience , brooks told fucoloro in an article published last year
and that bad experience means even though someone might bike to get around , a bad bike shop experience might dissuade them from learning more
myers said the mountainous , wooded area where brooks and sederbaum were attacked is home to many cougars
statewide , there are about 2,000 cougars living in the wild
but attacks are extremely rare
before saturday , 16 cougar attacks , one of which was fatal , had been reported in washington state during the past century
the first known fatal attack occurred in the 1920s , when a boy named jimmy fehlhaber was devoured by a male cougar
about 120 attacks , 25 of which were fatal , have been reported in the united states and canada in the past 100 years
however , attacks involving cougars , also known as mountain lions , have been increasingly common in the past 20 years
in washington state , for example , seven of all reported attacks occurred during the 1990s
myers said one possible reason for the uptick is humans encroachment of wildlife
human population has moved to rural areas and started to develop and became in contact with wildlife more often , myers said
that might be one of the reasons
in this time frame , people have certainly been pushing into wilder and wilder areas
if you encounter a cougar , dont run because the animals instinct is to chase
instead , authorities advise people to never take their eyes off the animal and to try to appear larger and more intimidating
shout , wave your arms and throw rocks , anything to let the animal know you are a threat and not prey
if the cougar attacks , fight back aggressively and try to stay on your feet , according to the washington department of fish and wildlife
cougars have been driven away by people who fought back
