on the eve of arizonas primary elections , she held a news conference to address the torrent of criticism over those remarks
ward said monday.
our differences were always strictly political.
ward did not dispute the notion and said in reply i think they wanted to have a particular narrative that they hope is negative to me
mccain , 81 , died saturday , just hours after wards facebook comments
ward , who is seeking the gop nomination to replace u.s. sen. jeff flake ( r-ariz. ) , has made controversial comments about mccain in the past
a far-right candidate , she shares president trumps hard-line policies on immigration and border security and has promised , as the president did , to drain the swamp.
mike cernovich steps into the u.s. senate race in arizona
a gonzo thing , he says
her staff didnt respond to calls seeking comment sunday
her comment , which appears to have been written from her personal facebook page , and the staffers post have either been deleted or are no longer publicly visible
but aaron borders , an arizona lobbyist and former second vice chair of the maricopa county gop , shared images of the exchange on his facebook page saturday
borders said that he was initially rooting for ward , whom he knows personally , but that the campaigns undisciplined messaging has appalled him
borders told the washington post.
thats about as narcissistic as it gets.
borders , who unsuccessfully sought the gop nomination for a seat in the arizona house of representatives in 2014 , said he has never seen a campaign more undisciplined and unfocused than wards
he said the facebook posts should not have been written at a time when mccains death was imminent and just days before the tuesday primary election
in a follow-up comment , ward said its the media that is creating a negative narrative about her , not the mccains
ward wrote , according to the arizona republic
that comment also appears to have been deleted
in a statement posted on her campaign facebook page after mccain died , ward expressed her condolences but did not address her previous comments
she also continued to double down sunday , again blaming the left and fakenews and sharing images of vile messages she said she has received in response to the comments about mccain
mccains primary rival urges him to step aside after diagnosis and suggests she could replace him
this isnt the first time that ward has found herself the subject of controversy over comments made about mccain
arizona law required the governor to appoint someone from the same party to fill mccains seat if he left office
asked whether her name was being considered as a possible replacement , ward said well , you know , i certainly hope so.
the comments were immediately seen as insensitive and self-serving
ward , again , blamed fake news and liberals
she is running against u.s. rep. martha mcsally and former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio in the gop primary to replace flake
mcsally has remained silent about ward , but arpaio spoke up
arpaio said in a statement
mcsally leads in several polls
ward surged in the race a few weeks ago , but mcsally and her strategists say theyre confident the congresswoman will stay ahead
ward entered politics in 2012 as an arizona state senator
she ran for u.s. senate in 2016 , when mccain defeated her in the republican primary
she caused a stir that year , too , when she suggested in a politico interview that mccain , who was then 79 , was too old and likely to die while in office
