sen. heidi heitkamp ( d-n.d. ) was ready to vote to confirm brett m. kavanaugh
her office had started drafting a statement saying she would support president trumps supreme court nominee , she told cnn
and then she watched kavanaugh unleash partisan attacks during his defiant testimony before the senate judiciary committee
heitkamp said she listened to kavanaughs exchange with sen. amy klobuchar ( d-minn. ) , who asked the judge whether he had ever been blackout drunk
kavanaugh threw the question back , saying , i dont know
have you
to the senator , who had just spoken about her fathers problems with alcoholism
heitkamp watched the hearing again , she told cnns dana bash , this time with the volume turned off
kavanaughs performance changed everything , heitkamp said
on saturday , she voted against kavanaugh , the most consequential vote she had cast to date in her senate career
the judges temperament , honesty and impartiality had been called into question , said heitkamp , who had voted last year to confirm neil m. gorsuch , trumps first supreme court nominee
heidi heitkamp talks to north dakotans about her no vote on kavanaugh i just hope i have the chance to explain why
and now , the first-term senate democrat , who won solidly red north dakota by a 1-percentage-point margin in 2012 , is fighting for her political future
some polls show her trailing by double digits against rep. kevin cramer ( r-n.d. ) , a congressman who questioned whether the sexual assault accusation against kavanaugh was disqualifying , even if it were true
christine blasey ford had alleged that kavanaugh groped her , pinned her down on a bed and tried to stifle her screams during a house party in maryland in 1982 , when the two were in high school
even if fords allegation is true , there was no type of intercourse or anything like that , cramer told a north dakota television station last month
cramer , whom the president supports , has sought to paint heitkamp as someone who chose party over the people she represents
recent polling in north dakota , which trump won by 36 percentage points in 2016 , showed substantial support for kavanaugh , the washington posts kyle swenson reported
heitkamp is among the most vulnerable senators in the midterm elections a reality underscored by a tweet from the candidate
fewer than 3,000 votes.thats how much we won by in 2012
this year could be even closer
thats why i need you to volunteer
its easy to sign
speaking at an event in wyndmere , n.d. , a few miles from her hometown , heitkamp told supporters that the past week had been tough for her
