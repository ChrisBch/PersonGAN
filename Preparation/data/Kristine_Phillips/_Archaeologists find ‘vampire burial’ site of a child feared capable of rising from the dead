inside a miniature tomb , in the middle of what used to be a sprawling roman villa , is the body of a 10-year-old child who died more than 1,500 years ago
the skeleton is on its side , its mouth agape and stuffed with a limestone rock about the size of a big egg
researchers believe the child , whose gender is still unknown , died after a deadly malaria outbreak afflicted the fifth-century community that once inhabited this tiny medieval town on a hill , about 60 miles north of rome
tooth-shaped depressions were found in the cement that covered the stone , leading archaeologists to believe it had been deliberately inserted into the childs mouth after death a bizarre , ancient practice to keep the child from rising from the dead and spreading the disease
archaeologists have dubbed these types of burials vampire burials.
locals in the italian town of lugnano in teverina call it the vampire of lugnano.
said jordan wilson , a bioarchaeologist and a university of arizona doctoral student who was part of the team that unearthed the remains in the summer
these discoveries offer a glimpse into a terrified society swept by a deadly , unknown disease
archaeologists say it may have paved the way for the end of the roman empire and even kept barbarian ruler attila the hun from finishing his invasion of italy
remains of 140 children unearthed in peru , the largest child sacrifice in human history
its just genuinely eerie.
soren said he first found out about the burial site in 1987 , when he was working on a different project on the island of cyprus and was invited to visit lugnano in italys umbria region the center of witchcraft during the roman empire
there , he saw what was left of the villa , about the size of a modern-day shopping mall
they found remnants of what had been a pyramid-shape dining room , slaves quarters , a ceiling that sloped on four sides , paintings and wall mosaics
amid dirt-covered trenches were the remains of infants , toddlers and aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talons , toad bones , bronze cauldrons filled with ash and sacrificial puppies
archaeologists call these deviant burials , or the ancient way of burying people who were feared to have supernatural abilities like coming back from death , or those who have violated societys rules , wilson said
antarctica has enormous mountain ranges and valleys deep beneath its ice
soren and his team of archaeologists have since excavated 51 remains of children proven through biomolecular tests to have died of malaria , and fetuses believed to have been doomed with the disease before birth
the oldest child to date was the 10-year-old , whose discovery was announced last week
researchers have not conducted further analysis to determine whether the child had died of malaria , but evidence of an abscessed tooth , a side effect of the disease , suggested that was the case
near the childs grave was the body of a 3-year-old girl , archaeologists say
her hands and feet had been weighed down with stones another form of a vampire burial to keep the evil away
she , too , had died of malaria
the urbanized roman empire was a cesspool of diseases that spread through contaminated food and water
swamps were a haven for mosquitoes , creating a ripe environment for malaria that would remain undiscovered until the 19th century
lugnano is not the only site of vampire burials
in venice in northern italy , an elderly 16th-century woman , who was buried with a brick in her mouth and discovered in 2009 , had been dubbed the vampire of venice.
in northamptonshire in england about 75 miles north of london , a man from the third or fourth century was found last year , a stone sat where his tongue had been
but beyond these bizarre discoveries were human beings who lived in fear , wilson said
and caught in the middle of this fear were the children who died in pain
