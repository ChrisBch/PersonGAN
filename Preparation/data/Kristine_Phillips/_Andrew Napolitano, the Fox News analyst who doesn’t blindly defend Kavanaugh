the same analyst had weighed in hours earlier after christine blasey ford told the committee that kavanaugh was the boy who sexually assaulted her more than three decades ago
andrew napolitanos words were equally sympathetic but carefully chosen
ford came across with great credibility and serious intellect , and is absolutely believable , he said
said napolitano , fox newss senior judicial analyst and a former judge from new jersey
at a time of deep political division , napolitano , also known as judge nap , has avoided catering to partisan and tribal outrage , even as he works for the most trump-friendly major media outlet , those who have known and watched him say
as kavanaughs confirmation to the supreme court unfolds with relentless drama and pugnacious rhetoric erupting from both sides of the aisle , napolitano has walked a fine line
he doesnt defend kavanaugh , but he doesnt defend ford , either
he chose to blow it a rare dissent from the couch of fox & friends after trump attacks ford
gillespie described napolitano as someone who places principles over partisanship , and who is outspoken and critical without resorting to ad hominem attacks
napolitano , through a fox news spokeswoman , declined to be interviewed and the network declined to comment
all this is not to say that napolitano , whos been with fox news since 1998 , is not political
hes a staunch libertarian who strongly opposes abortion
hes a fierce advocate of small government and deregulation , and has criticized vice president pence for allowing government to keep same-sex couples from getting married
he sees government surveillance and wiretapping as an affront to the constitution and said in a 2010 c-span interview that president george w. bush and vice president richard b. cheney should have been indicted for authorizing the use of torture
hes highly skeptical of foreign involvement and military intervention , and was against the obama administrations prosecution of journalists
napolitano , who practiced law in new jersey for 10 years and was a county judge for eight years before he became a tv personality , has created controversy , however
last year , fox news pulled napolitano from the air over his baseless claim repeated by president trump that british intelligence officials spied on trump at the request of president barack obama
nearly two weeks later , he was back on air and doubling down on his claims
in 2012 , he said obama secretly signed a bill that could restrict free speech when the president is nearby a claim that politifact rated as pants on fire false
but in this hyperpolarized age of cable networks , napolitano has become the difference between an intellectual and a hack , said ralph nader , a consumer advocate who unsuccessfully ran for president multiple times and who has known napolitano for a decade
if trump is watching fox news , brett kavanaugh might be in trouble
in the kavanaugh saga , napolitanos takes are more measured and sensible than the rest of fox news , said angelo carusone , president of media matters for america , a left-leaning media watchdog group
hes also critical of the one-week limit on the fbi investigation into kavanaugh , saying the agencys duty transcends the game clock.
fox news anchor says kavanaugh case prompted his own daughters to reveal their stories
its worth noting that napolitano has not been a lone voice thats been sympathetic of ford on the pro-trump network
and after the president mocked ford during a rally in mississippi tuesday , fox & friends host brian kilmeade was critical
