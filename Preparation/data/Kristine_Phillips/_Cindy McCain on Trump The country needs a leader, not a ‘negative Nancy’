in her first interview since her husbands death , cindy mccain , wife of sen. john mccain , said the country needs civility in its political discourse and a strong leader in the white house not a negative nancy.
mccain said friday on cbs this morning.
her husband , she said , would have been distraught over the countrys growing partisanship
she also said she hopes president trump would learn from the midterm elections , which saw a democratic takeover of the house and the ouster of several republicans in districts trump won in 2016
its very humbling to lose.
mccains interview with john dickerson comes nearly three months after her husband died at 81 of glioblastoma , an aggressive form of brain cancer
the senator , a vietnam war hero and a 2008 republican presidential candidate , had for years been an outspoken critic of trump and the trumpian style of politics
john mccain , maverick of the senate and former pow , dies at 81
he wrote in his memoir that a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more to trump than the nations values
trump had been vocal in his dislike of mccain , infamously mocking the senator for being captured and imprisoned during the vietnam war
trump also believed mccain was out to undermine his administrations agenda and grew angrier at the arizona republican last year , after mccain voted against a bill that would have repealed the affordable care act
following mccains death , trump refused to issue a statement praising the senators years of service
instead , he wrote a short tweet in which he expressed his condolences while avoiding saying anything about mccain
cindy mccain said it had been difficult for her to hear trump disparage her husband
while mccain avoided any strong rebuke of the president , her daughter did not
speaking in front of about 3,000 people at her fathers funeral at washington national cathedral in august , meghan mccain delivered a raw denunciation of trump and his campaign slogan
america was always great meghan mccain rebukes trump
cindy mccain said on cbs she did not know what her daughter was going to say in her speech
the mccain family did not invite trump to any of the celebrations of the senators life , while the senators onetime political rivals former presidents barack obama and george w. bush were asked to deliver eulogies
the snub was thought by some to be john mccains final rebuke of trump
not so , cindy mccain said
john never spoke about anything like that , she said.
that was never not his intention , and anyone who says that is wrong
it had nothing to do with the president
she did not , however , explain why the president was not invited
