seven members of a family , including a mother and her four young children , were killed in a mass shooting that rattled a small australian community and marked the first such incident in the country in more than 20 years
authorities in western australia responded early friday morning to a home in osmington , a rural town nestled in the countrys southwest corner
western australia police commissioner chris dawson did not confirm reports that the incident was a murder-suicide , but he said that only six of the family members were victims of a homicide , and police dont believe any other person was involved
police received an emergency call at 5:15 a.m. friday
dawson said a man had made the call from the familys property , but he did not give more details
dawson told reporters , adding that examination of the crime scene would take several days
its just horrifying seven killed in australias deadliest mass shooting in 22 years
three guns all registered to peter miles were found at the house
one of the deceased was found outside the house
another , a woman , was found inside
the other five , a woman and the children , were found in a converted shed structure , dawson said
police initially said that two people were found outside
the family was deeply connected in osmington , a community of 135 people , and in the nearby town of margaret river , one of western australias surfing hot spots
pam townshend , margaret river shire president , said the deaths shocked the community to the core.
the family members asked community members to not speculate on the circumstances of the deaths , according to the australian broadcasting corp
the family said in a statement
dawson said police have talked to the childrens father
the abc reported dawson saying
felicity haynes , a neighbor and family friend , told the abc that the victims moved into the home about three years ago

the deadly incident was australias worst mass shooting since the port arthur massacre in 1996 , when a gunman opened fire in a cafe in tasmania and then hunted down more victims in his vehicle , killing 35 and injuring many others
as the washington post reported , soon after the 1996 incident , john howard , who was elected as australias prime minister that year , enacted strict gun control
known as the 1996 national firearms agreement ( nfa ) , the law banned the possession , manufacture and sale of all semiautomatic firearms and pump-action shotguns other than in exceptional circumstances , such as military and police use
the nfa , one of the most stringent gun laws in the world , also mandated that applicants wait 28 days from the time they obtain a permit to the time they buy a weapon
applicants are also required to undergo firearms training , and weapons and ammunition must be stored separately , according to the law
he noted , however , that there were no significant changes in gun-related homicides in the country
but a 2016 investigation by an australian newspaper , the age , found that gun-related crimes in melbourne had doubled over the previous five years
the newspaper was applauding australias national firearms amnesty , which gives people the opportunity to register or sell their firearms no questions asked.
after fridays massacre , the premier of western australia , mark mcgowan , called the shooting appalling , awful and terrible , according to news.com.au
