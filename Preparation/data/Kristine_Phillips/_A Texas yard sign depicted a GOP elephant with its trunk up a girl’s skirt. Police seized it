at some point during judge brett m. kavanaughs testimony last week , marion stanford grabbed a piece of wooden paneling , some paint and the $ 5 brushes she had purchased awhile back
she brought the items back to her living room , where she had been glued to the television watching the drama unfold in the senate that day
she had heard christine blasey ford tell senators that kavanaugh , president trumps nominee to the supreme court , was the boy who sexually assaulted her 36 years ago , when they were both in high school
and as she listened to kavanaughs forceful denial and defense of himself , stanford began to paint
she drew an elephant , the republican symbol , in red , white and blue with its trunk climbing up the skirt of a little blond girl in pink
her eyes are wide open , and so is her mouth
the word help
is right next to her face
on the opposite side of the paneling , she painted the words , your vote matters , in the same shade of pink
stanford said , referring to the metoo movement
stanford placed the sign outside her home in the central texas town of hamilton , right below another sign supporting beto orourke , the democrat trying to unseat sen. ted cruz
a few days later , on tuesday night , a police officer showed up at her house
stanford said the officer told her there had been complaints about her sign , which some saw as a graphic depiction of child abuse
earlier a woman knocked on stanfords door and told her she found the sign disgusting.
susan collins announced support for kavanaugh causing site to fund future opponent to crash
it is pornography , and you cant display it , stanford recalled the police officer saying
she was given a few choices , she said take the sign down , refuse and get arrested , or let police confiscate it
she said she chose the last option
city officials denied threatening arrest
the washington post was unable to reach the hamilton police department for comment saturday
earlier that tuesday , the sign caught the attention of sid miller , the texas agriculture commissioner
miller , who was reportedly on trumps shortlist for u.s. agriculture secretary , posted pictures of the sign on his facebook page and claimed that the girl depicted was one of kavanaughs young daughters
the democrat sleaze knows no bounds , miller , whos again running for agriculture commissioner , wrote in a post that was later shared more than a thousand times
stanford said the girl does not depict kavanaughs daughter and portraying child abuse wasnt her intention
she said the yard sign was based on an editorial cartoon that washington post cartoonist ann telnaes drew last year , when then-senate candidate roy moore was accused of making sexual advances to minors
circuit sent complaints about kavanaughs testimony to chief justice roberts
stanford , a self-described independent who frequently leans liberal , said she found ford to be credible
stanford said , again invoking the metoo movement.
and the whole community is not going to stop me.
kavanaughs nomination to the supreme court was in peril a few weeks ago , after ford accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s , when the two were in high school in maryland
two other women accused kavanaugh of sexual misconduct , and the judge has unequivocally denied any wrongdoing
after a bitter and partisan battle , the senate on saturday confirmed kavanaugh in a narrow 50-to-48 vote , cementing a conservative majority on the nations highest court
hundreds of protesters many chanting we believe survivors
vote them out
and shame , shame , shame converged on the capitol in washington as the senate prepared to vote
kavanaughs confirmation was all but assured friday after sens
susan collins ( r-maine ) , jeff flake ( r-ariz. ) and joe manchin iii ( d-w.va. ) , said they would vote yea
one republican , sen. lisa murkowski , of alaska , broke with her party
