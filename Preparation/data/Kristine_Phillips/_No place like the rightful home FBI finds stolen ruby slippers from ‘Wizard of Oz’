a rare pair of red sequined slippers that judy garland wore in the classic film the wizard of oz has been found , the fbi announced tuesday , nearly 13 years after the legendary shoes were stolen from the actresss birthplace
investigators estimated that the heist took only seconds
at a news conference tuesday , investigators unveiled the once-missing shoes , enclosed in a glass case on top of blue velvet linen
grand rapids police chief scott johnson told reporters
last summer , the grand rapids police department received a tip that took investigators outside of minnesota , johnson said
the mystery of dorothys missing ruby slippers solve it , and youll get $ 1 million
officials revealed little else about how and where the shoes were found , citing an ongoing investigation
federal prosecutors in north dakota are involved in the probe
north dakota u.s. attorney christopher myers said investigators are still finding the person or people who stole the beloved movie memorabilia
he said his office will file charges as appropriate and if appropriate at a later time.
the judy garland museum didnt immediately return a call seeking comment tuesday
several pairs of ruby slippers were made for the 1939 mgm film , and at least four , including the stolen pair , are known to exist
one pair was found in the basement of mgms wardrobe department in 1970
an anonymous buyer bought those at an auction for $ 15,000 and donated the pair to the smithsonian in 1979
the pair was removed from display in april 2017 to be preserved and will be back on display in october
leonardo dicaprio and steven spielberg bought one other pair for display at the academy museum of motion pictures
another pair is owned by a private collector
the once-missing slippers are owned by collector michael shaw , who lent the slippers to the judy garland museum every year
museum officials wanted to keep the slippers in a safe every night , but shaw didnt want other people touching the delicate artifact
so shaw delivered the slippers himself and placed them in the plexiglass case
jon miner , one of the museums board members , told the washington posts jessica contrera in 2015.
of course , the owner was dumbfounded
and so were we.
dorothys ruby slippers will return to the national museum of american history on oct. 19
that year , a wealthy fan of the movie volunteered to give $ 1 million to the person who could help find the missing slippers
the shoes are famously connected to the line , theres no place like home.
toward the end of the movie , glinda the good witch revealed to dorothy that her magic slippers could take her back home
glinda instructs dorothy
dorothy does as shes told , chants theres no place like home , and wakes up in her home in kansas
myers , the federal prosecutor , said theres a certain romance and even sophistication to stealing such artifacts
the fbi has recovered about 14,850 stolen artifacts valued at more than $ 165 million since 2004
