much has been said about the back-to-back testimonies of christine blasey ford and judge brett m. kavanaugh
hers was devastating , as she asserted without question that kavanaugh was the boy who sexually assaulted her 36 years ago , the washington posts ruth marcus wrote
his was volcanic , as he not only unequivocally denied the allegations , but also decried an orchestrated political hit to ruin his reputation
for fords family members , her testimony thursday before the senate judiciary committee was moving , bringing them to tears
his only confused them , fords sisters-in-law , deborah peters and sandra mendler , told cnn on friday
christine blasey fords family has been nearly silent amid outpouring of support
listening to kavanaugh was just as difficult as listening to ford , mendler said , but the experiences of hearing the two speak , at times in tears and with their voices shaking , was very different
peters and mendler have been spokeswomen of sorts for fords family , many of whom have largely kept quiet as fords sexual assault allegation disrupted kavanaughs nomination to the supreme court
president trump on friday ordered the fbi to reopen the investigation on kavanaughs background , after sen. jeff flake ( r-ariz. ) , a frequent trump critic , called for a renewed inquiry into fords allegation
the stunning development presented yet another hurdle for kavanaugh , whose confirmation was all but assured until allegations from ford and two other women emerged
the 53-year-old jurists nomination has sharply divided the country and has laid bare the hyperpartisan war over the supreme court , as republicans fight for a chance to shift the judiciary to the right for decades
kavanaugh accuser christine blasey ford moved 3,000 miles to reinvent her life
it wasnt far enough
ford told the posts emma brown that she escaped after kavanaughs classmate and friend , mark judge , jumped on top of them , sending all three tumbling
in his opening statement thursday , kavanaugh said hes not questioning that ford may have been sexually assaulted but that he was not the one who had done it
two of kavanaughs classmates , judge and p.j
smyth , who ford said was at the party , provided statements to the senate judiciary committee saying they dont have knowledge or memory of any such incident
judge said he never saw kavanaugh act the way ford had described
smyth described kavanaugh as a person of integrity.
the post reported on sunday that the fbi has reached out to ramirez , though its unclear if investigators have talked to her
fbi again drawn into partisan controversy as republicans consent to limited , additional kavanaugh background check
they were also asked about a part of kavanaughs opening statement in which he said he harbors no ill will against ford , and as his voice trembled , talked about his 10-year-old daughter , who prayed for her fathers accuser
mendler acknowledged the emotional toll of being confronted with experiences from ones younger years
but she hinted that she wouldve preferred if kavanaugh had been more open to an investigation into the allegations
when pressed during the hearing why he was not asking for an fbi investigation into fords allegations , kavanaugh did not definitively answer and , instead , repeatedly deferred to the committees wishes
