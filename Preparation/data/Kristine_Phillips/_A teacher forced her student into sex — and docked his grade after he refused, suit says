a 27-year-old math teacher , jennifer olajire-aro , coerced a 17-year-old student into having sex with her , repeatedly threatening to dock his grades if he refused , according to a lawsuit filed by the south carolina teenager and his mother
the sexual advances had become so public , direct , and obvious that the student avoided aros classes at burke high school in charleston , aware that administrators , other teachers and his classmates knew about them , the lawsuit says
the sexual encounters ended in december , after the teen refused to have sex with aro who then lowered his grade from 98 to 89 out of 100 , according to the lawsuit
the teen and his mother sued aros employer , the charleston county school district , accusing officials of not quickly investigating aro despite a history of sexual misconduct in the district
that employee was later accused of molesting two students
a schools spokeswoman said the district does not comment on pending litigation
aro , now 28 , was charged in december with sexual battery of a student
her attorney , j. kevin holmes , did not return a call seeking comment tuesday
during aros bond hearing shortly after her arrest , holmes said she did not have a criminal record or disciplinary history at the school and had received teaching awards , the post and courier reported
she taught pre-calculus and algebra and is married with a baby girl
but peper said aro was hellbent on having a sexual relationship with the student
she began flirting with the teen after she became his math teacher at burke high in august 2017
she talked to him about sex before , during and after class , and made sexual advances in plain view of other teachers and students , the lawsuit alleges

in november and december , aro encouraged and coerced the teen to have sex with her on several occasions and at different places at the school , in her car , in her home
at least once , it happened around aros 10-month-old baby , the lawsuit says
when the teen resisted , aro turned to blackmail , peper said
peper alleged that school administrators and teachers who knew about the misconduct did not report it to school officials
the teens classmates knew about it , too , and teased him for being a teachers pet , among other things , peper said
the teen , the suit says , didnt say anything about the teacher to his mother for weeks , fearing that aro would dock his grade as she had threatened to do
but in december , he decided he couldnt go on

aro then docked the teens fall-semester grade by 11 points , the lawsuit says
he told his mother , who immediately reported the allegations to police and school officials
but peper said the district did not investigate until about three weeks later , and aro was arrested
erica taylor , the district spokeswoman , said aro was immediately placed on administrative leave and was fired in january , the month after she was charged
the district has been facing criticism for its handling of sexual allegations against a former employee at another school
marvin gethers was promoted to a higher-paying job in 2014 and became employee of the year in 2015 both after an it specialist found that he had accessed child pornography from his school laptop , wcsc reported
gethers was arrested in 2016 , after which time two children told police that he had molested them in 2015 , the post and courier reported
gethers was later charged with sexual exploitation of a minor and multiple counts of criminal sexual misconduct with a minor , online court records show
he died of heart failure in july 2017 and was never tried
taylor said the school district fired gethers once officials learned of the allegations against him
she said school officials who were in charge in 2014 , when gethers was promoted , are no longer with the district
