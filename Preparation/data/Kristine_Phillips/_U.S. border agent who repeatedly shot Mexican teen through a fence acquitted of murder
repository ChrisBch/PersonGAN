a u.s. border patrol agent was acquitted of murder in the shooting death of a mexican teen who threw rocks at law enforcement officers during an attempt to smuggle marijuana to mexico
but the arizona jury that acquitted lonnie swartz of second-degree murder monday was deadlocked on lesser manslaughter charges
a mistrial was declared , and federal prosecutors are evaluating whether to retry swartz on the manslaughter charges
the verdict was reached after a month-long trial and 18 hours of deliberation over five days , the associated press reported
the death of 16-year-old jose antonio elena rodriguez in 2012 caught the attention of human rights groups who said the case marked the first time a u.s. border patrol agent was prosecuted in a cross-border shooting
elena rodriguez was killed oct. 10 , 2012 , near a fence along the border separating arizona and mexico
court records say he and others hurled rocks from the mexican side to the u.s. side to keep border agents distracted while two drug smugglers attempted to cross into mexico
swartz fired several shots , killing elena rodriguez , who was on calle internacional , a street that runs parallel to the border fence and is in nogales , in the mexican state of sonora , the teens home town
the teen was shot 10 times , mostly in the back
after a lengthy investigation , a federal grand jury indicted swartz in 2015 he has been on administrative leave without pay ever since , according to the union that represents border patrol agents
prosecutors say that elena rodriguez was still alive when he fell to the ground
but swartz kept firing , they said , even though elena rodriguez was no longer a threat
during the trial in federal court in tucson , prosecutors argued that elena rodriguez did not deserve to die
assistant u.s. attorney wallace heath kleindienst said during closing arguments that swartz was fed up with being rocked because similar incidents had happened before , the ap reported
kleindienst told jurors.
it was about eliminating a human being.

human rights groups argued that the teen , who was not armed , would not have posed a threat to border patrol agents , who were on the other side of a fence that towers several feet above the mexican side
swartzs attorneys , however , said his use of lethal force was justified because he was defending himself and his fellow agents
tucson defense attorney sean chapman told jurors that there was no evidence that swartz was fed up.
chapman said , according to the ap
defense attorneys also say that , contrary to the prosecutors theory , elena rodriguez died immediately after the first shots
he fell , and swartz kept shooting
that means , they argued , that swartz should not be held criminally liable because he did not continue to shoot someone who was still alive and lying on the ground
defense attorneys point to findings by two mexican pathologists who concluded that one of the first bullets hit elena rodriguezs head while he was still standing , killing him instantly
first assistant u.s. attorney elizabeth a
strange said in a statement that her office respected the jurys decision in what she described as a difficult case.
chapman , the defense attorney , did not respond to a call seeking comment
art del cueto , president of the union that represents border patrol agents , praised the acquittal

the case struck a nerve among residents of nogales , a city that straddles two countries
the northern half of nogales is in arizona , while the southern end is in mexico
the not-guilty verdict prompted protests , with activists chanting no justice , no peace monday as they gathered outside the federal courthouse , the arizona republic reported
some protesters wore black veils , while others held pictures of elena rodriguez as they marched in the streets of tucson
in 2014 , the american civil liberties union filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of elena rodriguezs mother , araceli
swartz sought to dismiss the lawsuit , arguing that elena rodriguez was not entitled to constitutional protections because he was a mexican citizen who died while on the mexican side of the border
a judge ruled in 2015 that the lawsuit could move forward
swartz has appealed that ruling , and the case is still pending
del cueto , the union president , railed against a portrayal of swartz as a violent man who killed a defenseless teen
