faced with criticisms from president trump that twitter is shadow banning and silencing conservative voices , chief executive jack dorsey admitted that those who work for the social media giant have their own biases and that theyre more left-leaning.
dorsey , however , said in his interview with cnn on saturday that political ideology does not influence how twitter determines what is and is not appropriate behavior on the platform
we do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint or ideology , jack told me
but he knows some people do not believe him
i think we need to constantly show that we are not adding our own bias , which i fully admit is left , is more left-leaning , he says ...
dorseys comments come amid a debate over how tech companies influence public discourse
apple , facebook , youtube and spotify have taken aggressive steps against right-wing talk show host and conspiracy theorist alex jones for violating their hate-speech policies
spotify , facebook and youtube removed jones from their platforms , and apple followed suit by removing the majority of podcasts published by joness website , infowars , from itunes and its podcast apps
twitter also suspended joness account for a week after he urged his supporters to get their battle rifles ready against antifascists and the mainstream media
jones made the comments on his show , which was published on periscope , twitters video-streaming service
twitter said joness comments violated the companys rules about violent threats
in an interview with the washington post last week , dorsey said he is rethinking core parts of twitter to curb the spread of hate speech , harassment and false news
he also told the post that hes experimenting with new features that would allow people to see alternative viewpoints and reduce echo chambers.
the president has loudly protested what he sees as bias against conservative voices , tweeting saturday that social media companies are totally discriminating against republicans
jack dorsey says hes rethinking the core of how twitter works
trump wrote from his private resort in bedminster , n.j. , vowing that his administration wont let that happen.
the president also floated the idea of weeding out fake news , naming cnn and msnbc , but he said hes not asking that their sick behavior be removed
last month , trump said that twitter is shadow banning prominent republicans
dorsey described shadow banning as not amplifying certain messages , or hiding a tweet from users
he also said that people like him should be more open about their personal views and objectives
earlier this month , dorsey called on journalists to document , validate , and refute unsubstantiated rumors that spread on twitter
some journalists took issue with the tweet and said its not their job to police false information on twitter
los angeles times national correspondent matt pearce said
accounts like jones can often sensationalize issues and spread unsubstantiated rumors , so its critical journalists document , validate , and refute such information directly so people can form their own opinions
this is what serves the public conversation best
