five people have died and nearly 200 from about three dozen states have been sickened by e. coli in a growing outbreak that has so far stumped federal investigators
the centers for disease control and prevention announced the tally friday , more than two months after the first illnesses occurred in mid-march
the cdc said 197 people have been sickened , nearly half of whom were hospitalized
some told officials that they did not eat romaine lettuce but became ill after close contact with people who had eaten contaminated vegetables , the cdc said
twenty-six developed hemolytic uremic syndrome , a type of kidney failure that can be life-threatening to people with weak immune systems , such as young children and the elderly
why e. coli keeps getting into our lettuce
a majority of those who have been affected come from california , where one death was reported , and pennsylvania
the four other deaths were reported in arkansas , minnesota and new york , according to the cdc
last month , the canadian government announced six cases of illness caused by escherichia coli with a similar genetic fingerprint to those reported in the united states
two of the six told officials that they had traveled across the border before they became ill. three were infected in canada
canadian officials , though , said the risk to canadians is low
the fda initially said that only bagged and pre-chopped romaine lettuce that had been distributed to retailers across the country was contaminated with e. coli , but a number of inmates at a prison in alaska also became ill after eating whole-head lettuce
because a majority of the illnesses were linked to packaged vegetables that had been passed from suppliers to distributors to processing facilities where they were chopped and bagged , finding out where they were grown is far more cumbersome
gottlieb and ostroff said in their joint statement
this is the worst outbreak since 2006 , when 205 people became ill and five died after contracting e. coli from baby spinach
e. coli is a type of bacteria found in undercooked beef , raw milk , soft cheeses made from raw milk , raw fruits and vegetables , and contaminated water
most e. coli bacteria is not harmful , but one type known as e. coli o157 h7 produces a toxin called shiga , which destroys red blood cells , and causes kidney failure and bloody diarrhea
other kinds of e. coli cause urinary tract infections , respiratory illness and pneumonia
health officials said children under the age of 5 , seniors older than 65 and those with weak immune systems are most vulnerable
so far , the outbreak has sickened people ages 12 to 84
