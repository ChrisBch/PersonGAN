we realize that rodriguez aguilera is an unusual candidate.
so conceded a miami herald editorial endorsing a candidate who once claimed that majestic , blond extraterrestrial beings kidnapped her when she was 7
years before bettina rodriguez aguilera announced her bid to replace one of the most influential cuban americans in congress , she appeared on spanish-language television programs and talked about her alien experience
she saw three beings two women and a man she said
they were tall and full-figured
they spoke to her telepathically
they took her on board the spaceship , and inside , she saw round seats
but editorial page editor nancy ancrum said she does not believe that rodriguez aguileras beliefs or past experiences have influenced her ability to become an effective public servant
rodriguez aguilera , who is running in the republican primary for a south florida congressional district , has the heftiest rsum of all the candidates in that race the editorial board interviewed , ancrum said
the endorsement does add another layer of weirdness to a state already known for its penchant for oddballs
take , for example , melissa howard , a state house hopeful who is now infamous for touting a fake college diploma and has since dropped out of the race
in its editorial published sunday , nine days before the primary election , the board said it agreed with rodriguez aguilera that her past comments about extraterrestrial beings are a non-issue.
she is a strong candidate with plausible conservative ideas who has a solid background as a former city official and a business executive , the board wrote
the board wrote
she claimed tall , blond aliens kidnapped her as a child
now she 's running for congress
rodriguez aguilera said shes happy with the heralds endorsement
she said the board asked her about her previous comments about extraterrestrial beings
her response was that they are not important , and the board agreed , she said
rodriguez aguilera , whos running on a promise to help south floridas working class , told the post
rodriguez aguilera is running to replace rep. ileana ros-lehtinen ( r ) , the first hispanic woman and cuban american elected to congress
ros-lehtinen , who represents much of miami and miami beach , announced in april 2017 that she will retire , giving democrats a chance to flip a south florida congressional district that hillary clinton carried in the 2016 presidential election
according to the herald , rodriguez aguilera is one of three best-known candidates in the crowded republican primary , though shes not viewed as the front-runner
the other two , spanish-language television star maria elvira salazar and former miami-dade commissioner bruno barreiro , declined to participate in the heralds interview process
ancrum said barreiros campaign told the board that he is not seeking an endorsement , and salazars schedule is booked until aug. 28 , which is election day
that left the board with a choice between rodriguez aguilera and four other lesser-known candidates
ancrum said , adding that the board did not believe the other four candidates were quite ready for a seat in congress
rodriguez aguilera , however , has raised only about $ 80,000 , compared with salazars $ 682,000 and barreiros $ 576,000 , according to federal campaign reports
she first entered politics as a council member from doral , fla. , from 2012 to 2014
the citys mayor nominated her to replace the vice mayor in 2013
she sponsored a human-trafficking ordinance in 2014 after two massage parlors were shut down for prostitution
she said she helped boost dorals economic and population growth during her time as the citys economic development coordinator , a position she held for four years
she also previously worked as a social worker for miami-dade county and later as an ombudsman at the county managers office , according to her campaign website
florida candidate tried to prove shes a college graduate
the school says her diploma is fake
rodriguez aguilera announced her candidacy for floridas 27th congressional district in august 2017
a few months later , the miami herald unearthed old television interviews in which she talked about extraterrestrials
in one video that was uploaded to youtube long before the herald highlighted it , rodriguez aguilera talked about boarding the aliens spaceship
in another interview , she said that the beings , with their arms wide open , reminded her of jesus christ , and that she saw them again during her teenage years
she said the aliens also talked about isis , an egyptian goddess
( its also an acronym for the islamic state militant group , which did not exist at the time of rodriguez aguileras interviews )
she made several other claims africa is the center of energy
there are 30,000 nonhuman skulls in a subterranean cave on the island of malta in the mediterranean
coral castle , a limestone structure in south florida , is an ancient pyramid
rodriguez aguilera told the post earlier that she merely described experiences she had and that they have nothing to do with who she is and with her work in public service
she also accused the herald of negatively portraying her interviews , calling an article published in october an attack piece.
now , the heralds editorial board , which is separate from the papers news section , is placing its support behind rodriguez aguilera , whose boots-on-the-ground ideas and experience set her apart from the two front-runners , the board said
rodriguez aguilera has outlined what she calls a working-class agenda , and has proposed reforming the fair credit act to change the credit score system , making student loan payments more affordable , and creating hardship rental insurance to reduce homelessness
people just have to look at it in context.
