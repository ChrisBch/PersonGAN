nineteen people have died of ebola in congo as health officials plan to send an experimental vaccine to prevent the spread of the virus that killed thousands in west africa a few years ago
the world health organization said there have been 39 confirmed and suspected cases of ebola over the past five weeks as the virus spreads across three rural areas covering nearly 40 miles in the northwest part of the country
among the dead were three health-care workers
health officials are following up with nearly 400 people identified as contacts of ebola patients
the global health agency announced last week its plans to send the vaccine , developed in 2016 by the pharmaceutical company merck
health officials hope that the vaccine , which was given to people in guinea in west africa during a trial in 2015 , could be a game-changer in preventing ebola from spreading , the washington posts siobhn ogrady wrote last week
among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine , called rvsv-zebov , no one came down with ebola 10 days after vaccination
a pioneering vaccine is being sent to congo in hopes of containing a new ebola outbreak
tedros adhanom ghebreyesus , the whos director-general , told reporters monday that the agency has received permission from congo officials to import the vaccine , which he hopes would arrive by the end of this week
the who has a stockpile of 4,300 doses of the vaccine in geneva , stat news reported
merck also has committed 300,000 doses of the vaccine for emergency use
ghebreyesus said he has traveled to the remote area to assess health needs
said ghebreyesus , a former ethiopian health minister and the first african to become whos director-general.
we have to be where the problem is.
peter salama , who 's deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response , said at a united nations briefing in geneva on friday , according to reuters
transporting the vaccines to the affected area would be logistically challenging
salama said the area is about 15 hours away by motorbike from the closest town and lacks the necessary infrastructure , reuters reported
he said friday that the who plans to send up to 40 experts by the weekend and clear an airstrip for supplies
the country has experienced eight ebola outbreaks over the past four decades
the most recent happened last year , when four people in likati in the northern part of the country died
an outbreak in 2014 killed 49 people
the largest ebola outbreak in history ravaged the west african countries of sierra leone , guinea and liberia
nearly 30,000 confirmed and suspected cases were reported
about 11,300 died from 2014 to 2016
the who has acknowledged its bungled handling of the massive outbreak , saying it failed to recognize early that the west african countries that severely lacked health infrastructures were at imminent risk
according to a draft internal document obtained by the associated press , nearly everyone failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall.
by early september 2014 , more than 1,800 had died in sierra leone , guinea and liberia , and the global health community still had no coordinated response
president barack obama later dispatched up to 3,000 military personnel to west africa , an effort with a $ 750 million price tag
symptoms of ebola usually manifest eight to 10 days after exposure
these include fever , headache , diarrhea , vomiting and hemorrhage
