last week , nearly 40 members of the delta sigma theta sorority showed up at the bahama breeze restaurant in orange village , ohio , for a celebration
a local member of the historically black sorority had gotten a book deal and was moving to los angeles
the tuesday night dinner was a combination toast to her success and farewell party
on wednesday night , the group returned to the restaurant carrying protest signs that said stop racial profiling and chanting boycott bahama breeze.
in between , sorority members said , theyd become the latest example of livingwhileblack , people of color whove had the police called on them while engaged in normal , everyday activities
this time it was complainingabouttheservice while black
their reservation had initially called for 25 people at the caribbean-themed restaurant , but about 15 extra people had showed up , organizers told cleveland nbc affiliate wkyc
tensions rose as service slowed to a snails pace , and the customers started griping
then things escalated to absurd levels , people attending the dinner said
one of the attendees threatened to withhold payment because of the poor service , wkyc reported
the manager called police to the restaurant to make sure that didnt happen and officers watched as each customer paid for her meal
the night ended in demeaning fashion , the diners claimed with officers standing at the door , checking receipts before they let any of the black women leave the establishment
the restaurant got its money and no one was arrested , but the sorority sisters were aggrieved
surely , the restaurant didnt call the police on every disgruntled customer
i had the worst experience at bahamabreeze in orange village , ohio
they literally racially profiled is
my cousin had a going away dinner/celebration for sucvessfully writing her book
the manager devin called the police bc she was afraid that the party wouldnt/couldnt pay
rep. marcia l. fudge ( d-ohio ) , a member of delta sigma theta , said she was appalled at the incident , which she deemed racial profiling
bahama breeze took to twitter to apologize for its actions
ohio bahama breeze fires manager who called the police on black sorority girls
but it was unclear whether the apology would quell the calls for a boycott and the accusations of racism that have surfaced
some critics dug up a lawsuit in which the company conceded that some managers used racial slurs
the $ 1.26 million settlement with the federal equal employment opportunity commission in 2009 said managers in a cleveland establishment referred to 37 black staff members using racial slurs including the n-word , you people , homeboy and aunt jemima.
and denied them breaks that were allowed for white employees , according to the eeoc
debra m. lawrence , the acting regional attorney for the eeocs philadelphia office at the time , said in the release
recently , neighbors , proprietors and store managers have been accused of more subtle forms of racism against black people , incidents that have frequently been caught on film or video and shared widely
livingwhileblack victims want congressional hearing on racial profiling
on may 12 , for example , members of a black sorority were questioned by a state trooper while picking up litter on a pennsylvania highway
a yale university student was interrogated by police after her dorm neighbor called police because she was napping in a common area
and a real-estate investor had the police called on him when he showed up to rehabilitate a house
the incidents have given rise to the hashtag livingwhileblack and often end with a black person being interrogated by police or being carted off in handcuffs
in the worst cases , the incidents have escalated to body slams or even gunshots
