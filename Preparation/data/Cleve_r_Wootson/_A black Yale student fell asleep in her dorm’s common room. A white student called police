lolade siyonbolas exasperated message to the campus police officers and to the yale university graduate student whod summoned them to her dorm was simple and consistent
she didnt have to do anything to prove that she was justified in being there , just because she happened to be black
it was part of a tense , racially tinged exchange that the african studies student had this week with four police officers and the graduate student who called 911 after she found siyonbola napping in the hall of graduate studies 12th-floor common room
the encounter , broadcast by siyonbola on facebook live , has roiled the campus community , sparking campus leaders to call for more conversations about inclusiveness
the nation is also engaged in a dialogue about disparate treatment of minorities in public places after black people who have not committed crimes have controversially had the police called on them at an alabama waffle house , philadelphia starbucks and pennsylvania golf course
and for anyone keeping score , it adds napping to the long and apparently still growing list of things it is unacceptable to do while black
lewis while black , among others
siyonbola is a first-year graduate student in the african studies department at yale
she had papers and books spread out in a common room while writing a paper monday , but had flipped off the lights and went to sleep , she explained in her facebook live video
another graduate student , sarah braasch , walked in , turned on the lights and said she was calling police
the common room was off-limits for sleeping , she added
she wanted to criticize black lives matter in a college speech
a protest shut her down
what followed was a racially tinged , police-involved dispute between neighbors that aired live on facebook then spread
agitated , siyonbola went to braaschs room , aiming a cellphone camera at her , and demanded to know why she had called the authorities
continue , siyonbola said , then taunted her.
get my good side.
instead , braasch shut the door and siyonbola waited for the police , who became the subject of her second live video
an officer said
the officer told siyonbola that he doesnt know either woman , is simply trying to quickly sort out whats going on and needs to check her identification
ultimately , but unhappily , siyonbola relented
she did not immediately respond to washington post messages seeking comment
as the police tried to sort out who she was ( siyonbolas given name in a yale database conflicted with her preferred name on the card , a spokesman said
) , she told them braasch had called police on her friend about three months ago because he was in the stairwell and he was black.
she claimed that she is facing the same kind of harassment , from braasch and from the four police officers who responded to her non-crime
later , a supervising officer told siyonbola that she wasnt harassed , at least not by the officers
the supervisor told her
then the officers bid her good night
braasch , a graduate philosophy student , could also not be reached for comment
she had reportedly deleted social media accounts or set them to private in the wake of the incident
kimberly m. goff-crews , yales vice president for student life , said in an email to students that the officers admonished the student who called 911 and that the other student had every right to be present.
she said they were planning listening sessions with the yale community and encouraged students to share their thoughts
the issue is , of course , much bigger than yale
people have picketed coffee shops and received apologies from ceos and college presidents over viral issues of bias that spread at the speed of the internet , giving institutions an instantaneous black eye
and with the while black incidents piling up , the aggrieved parties have begun to point out the similarities sometimes in the very videos they post
a tearful kimberly houzah said after being kicked out of a victorias secret in 2016
black people who had tense conversations with police said they felt as if their race made them more likely to be treated with suspicion by the white people around them
in some instances , they felt as though celebrating their blackness was being treated as a crime
after calling barbara bush an amazing racist , a professor taunts critics i will never be fired
in a post on her facebook page a day after the incident , siyonbola also acknowledged that other black people have endured similar treatment
then she invited anyone reading her post to share similar stories
by friday , nearly 10,000 people had commented
