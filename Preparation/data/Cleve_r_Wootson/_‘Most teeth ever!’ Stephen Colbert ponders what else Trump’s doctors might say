stephen colbert did not seem all that surprised that donald trump was not the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.
in fact , in the wake of revelations from trumps doctor that the would-be president had personally dictated a glowing 2015 bill of health , colbert quipped on wednesday that he had received other letters that sounded vaguely medical and overwhelmingly trumpian
and from trumps dentist most teeth ever
much longer tongue than obama.
colbert apologizes to isis , recently unseated by trump as the enemy of the american people
on tuesday , trumps longtime physician , harold bornstein , told cnn that his signature was about the only authentic thing he wrote on the letter about trumps health
the december 2015 letter had a certain trump-esque bombast to it
but while heavy on adjectives , the letter didnt include many medical claims to back up its glowing appraisal , besides saying trumps blood pressure was 110/65
it said trump had dropped 15 pounds over the past year , and said his cardiovascular health was excellent.
colbert concluded his bit with a nod to another controversy swelling in the white house
