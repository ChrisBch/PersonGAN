the nomination fight over judge brett m. kavanaugh has injected new volatility into the midterm elections , reshaping races across the country and sharpening the already bitterly partisan tone for the final four-week stretch before nov. 6
that division stems from the makeup of the races and the political geography of the most competitive battles
but most of this years competitive senate races are in traditionally red states , and as republicans have rallied to kavanaughs side , the chances of democratic upsets there have dropped , at least for now
democrats are growing more concerned about keeping their seats in indiana , missouri , and montana and appear to be losing ground when it comes to potential pickups in texas and tennessee
one of the most vulnerable democratic incumbents , sen. heidi heitkamp of north dakota , who said thursday that she would vote against kavanaugh , has fallen far behind her republican challenger in new polling
sen. joe manchin iii of west virginia , another vulnerable democrat , looked to secure his lead when he became the final senator and only democrat to announce a vote for kavanaugh
but in the house , political prognosticators have moved more than half a dozen seats in the democratic direction in recent days , and republican operatives are bracing themselves for an onslaught of democratic money that they are calling a green wave.
gubernatorial races in which democrats are trying to regain territory that theyve lost in recent years , particularly in the midwest are also trending left
the supreme court battle has washed over the campaign in a way that no single issue has before , drowning out topics democrats want to talk about ( health care ) or the ones republicans are pushing ( tax cuts and a rosy economy )
in a season defined by enough-is-enough female energy along with white male rage and aggrievement that is stomping back to 2016 levels the kavanaugh confirmation hearings were explosive on all fronts
democrats have always faced a difficult senate map six of the competitive seats that they hold are in states trump won , and five of those states he carried by at least 19 points but their path now is more treacherous
in north dakota , television screens across the state were flashing with ads both attacking heitkamp and defending her record
at fargos vfw post 762 , drinkers pulled their eyes away from the nightly happy hour drink raffle to watch back-to-back political spots
just hours before heitkamp announced her opposition to kavanaugh , voters like stephanie beyah were still weighing their support for the incumbent based on what the senator might do
troy reich , a burly man in a flannel shirt juggling a stack of boxes as he entered a post office in downtown fargo , said he was a firm supporter of heitkamps opponent , republican nominee rep. kevin cramer ( r-n.d. )
but the kavanaugh hearings increased his anger at democrats , and he feels the drama will affect tight races like the senate contest
now were waiting to see who the shrapnel takes out.
recent polls show a dead heat between donnelly , who announced his opposition to kavanaugh last month , and his republican opponent mike braun
tim chapman , the executive director of heritage action for america , a conservative political organization , said the kavanaugh hearing was a game changer for red state democrats like donnelly
kate oehl , donnellys press secretary , said the senator will spend the next month focused on health care , which his campaign believes is a more salient issue for voters
for republicans , a major challenge will be keeping their base riled up over how kavanaugh was treated , even though he was confirmed in the end
the dynamics in the house races are completely different because of their political terrain
of the 68 house races viewed as competitive by the cook political report , only 16 are in states that have a competitive senate race
democrats are feeling confident about winning a net of 23 seats needed to control the house
already , republicans are pulling money from several districts they had initially hoped could be within their grasp
republicans are suffering particular problems among highly educated voters who live outside urban centers like kansas city , philadelphia and denver
the national republican congressional committee pulled about $ 1 million in planned spending from the 3rd congressional district in kansas , where rep. kevin yoder is running for reelection
the countervailing forces could be seen in the suburbs outside of newark , where republican leonard lance is seeking his sixth term in a district that hillary clinton carried in 2016
its been a re-energizer , frankly , janice mclean , 58 , said during a democratic-led protest in new jersey
republican women are motivated , said marlene sincaglia , a retired middle school french teacher , a few hours later and a few miles away
lances opponent , democrat tom malinowski , a former assistant secretary of state under president obama , released an ad on sept. 26 featuring a sound bite of lance seeming to question fords allegations that kavanaugh had assaulted her
lance is heard saying on the clip
lance told the post he found fords testimony to be credible as well as kavanaughs and noted that he was among the republicans who called for an fbi investigation
protesters , who have often come to his district office to protest trump , are now focused on kavanaugh
in westfield , n.j. , days ago , a 2-year-old girl on her fathers shoulders held a message scrawled on the back of a pampers box believe women.
a 61-year-old artist waved a fluorescent pink sign that said hell no kava-no in her left hand and a tambourine in her right
another woman who said her college-age daughter had been raped her freshman year propped up a banner that read i believe dr. christine blasey ford
across the district in berkeley heights , lance mingled with constituents nibbling on crudits at a reception before kicking off a boy scouts awards dinner
some of the republican voters there were fired up in support of kavanaugh
margaret illis , another woman at the event , has two sons and two daughters spanning ages 17 to 24
it is her daughters she fears for
illis , a recently registered democrat who considers herself an independent , said she has voted for lance a number of times in the past
she now plans to vote for malinowski because i want my daughters to have a better future.
said illis , who attends house parties where activists send handwritten notes to infrequent voters encouraging them to vote by mail and reminding them of whats at stake
im passionate now , she said , about changing my representative in congress.
