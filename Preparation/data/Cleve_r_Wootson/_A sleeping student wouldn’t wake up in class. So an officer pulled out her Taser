the newly minted junior at liberty preparatory school was perhaps still on summer break schedule during class last week
his teacher could n't wake him up
even summoning the interim principal was n't enough to get the teenager to open his eyes
so the smithville , ohio , educators called for the school resource officer , a part-time member of the local police named maryssa boskoski , whose idea of an impromptu alarm could cost her job and maybe even her freedom
as a classroom full of students looked on , she reached into her holster and pulled out her department-issued taser , according to cleveland abc affiliate wews
then she removed the firing cartridge and pulled the trigger
smithville school resource officer on leave after using taser to wake up a student in class
the ensuing electric buzz startled the student awake and stunned a northeast ohio charter school community that felt a weapon used to subdue combative criminals should n't be used to rouse a drowsy student
a taser is a brand of electronic stun gun that fires probes that stick in a person 's skin and transmit 50,000 volts of electricity , along with a painful , paralyzing shock
but if the probe-containing cartridge is removed , the taser can arc , emitting a visible bolt of electricity , an audible buzz and a painful jolt if it touches someone
school officials notified parents of what they deemed an inappropriate use of the stun gun in a letter that did not reveal the identity of the student
school leaders said in a letter obtained by wtmj.
at no time was any student in any kind of danger.
boskoski , who is also a member of the air force reserve , works part time for the smithfield police department
she could not immediately be reached for comment
but smithfield police chief howard funk says that boskoski was previously disciplined for a separate taser-related incident a month ago
funk told the news station he was disappointed that this took place.
boskoski is on unpaid leave
an 11-year-old was accused of shoplifting
an off-duty officer tasered her in the back
an investigation was ongoing , according to the associated press , and funk said he would meet with the smithville solicitor to see if charges should be filed
funk did not immediately return a message from the washington post seeking comment
in the previous case , boskoski did n't remove the cartridge from her taser before doing what officers refer to as a spark test
when she pulled the trigger , the taser fired near another officer
although originally marketed as less-than-lethal alternatives to officers pulling firearms , tasers have been linked to dozens of deaths , according to a 2015 washington post report
research shows that when used correctly , the devices are generally safe and prevent injuries to both police officers and civilians
but when tasers are used excessively or if officers dont follow department policy or product guidelines , the risk of injury or death can increase , according to company product warnings and police experts
taser issues can be particularly thorny for school resource officers
the combative people they encounter are often children , and officers use of force can face additional scrutiny
for example , officers said they could n't subdue a girl who got into a fight at morgan fitzgerald middle school in pinellas park , fla
video captured by bystanders captured an officer shooting his taser at the fleeing girl after she screamed , get off me
a school spokesman said , according to the kansas city star
