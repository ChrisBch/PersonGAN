in franklin gebhardts eyes , timothy cogginss crime was simple coggins was a black man who was dating a white woman
the pair stabbed coggins more than 30 times , leaving a patchwork of bloody xes on the young mans skin , prosecutors said , according to the atlanta journal constitution
then , the two white men chained coggins to the back of a pickup truck , took him to a desolate part of town and dragged him across the asphalt until he stopped moving
cogginss corpse was so badly damaged investigators at first had difficulty identifying him
it was , spalding county sheriff darrell dix later told the journal constitution , a slaying so heinous it appeared to be sending a message.
gebhart and moore boasted to their buddies that the killing of a black man in cold blood was a public service
hate crimes jump for fourth straight year in largest u.s. cities , study shows
authorities combed through missing persons reports before identifying coggins a day after his bloody remains were found in a grassy ditch
no witnesses came forward , police exhausted their leads , and the case went cold even though one of cogginss killers openly bragged about the time he killed a black man with impunity
gebhardt once told a girlfriend , the gbis coleman told jurors , according to the journal constitution
threats like that , investigators said , contributed to a cone of silence that kept the case cold for years
prosecutor marie broder said
gebhardt and his brother-in-law were laborers at a pulp mill , but had reputations as toughs with nasty , racist streaks and rap sheets gebhardt had been charged with aggravated assault several times and had spent time in a georgia penitentiary
they also had friends in key places
two of them gregory huffman and lamar bunn were law enforcement officers when gebhardt and moore were eventually arrested , cnn reported
huffman is accused of revealing the identity of a confidential informant who was being used against gebhardt , the associated press reported
bunn previously worked for the spalding county sheriffs office and was employed as an officer at another department when gebhardt was arrested
as wsb radio reported , half the evidence in the coggins investigation disappeared over the years
as those years passed , there were no breaks in the case
to cogginss family , it was a three-decade slap in the face the feeling that the whole community cared nothing for his gruesome death
the break finally came a year ago , when authorities said they received new information that prompted a deeper look into the case
investigators were able to find people to whom gebhardt had bragged in prison
defense attorneys countered that those key witnesses had their own checkered pasts and that they were cooperating solely because prosecutors had struck deals for reduced sentences
in court testimony , they relayed things only the true killer would know , the journal constitution reported
in the end , it took the jury just six hours to return the guilty verdict the family had wanted for decades
gebhardt was convicted of committing a murder that was driven by racial hatred
weve waited for 34 years to even be here today , coggins niece , heather coggins , said to nbc news.
we never thought that we would be here
we thought tim had been forgotten
moore is awaiting trial
