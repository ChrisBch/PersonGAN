college professor jeff mcclenahan hiked up a winding road saturday toward a terrible unknown , expecting the worst
but fires can be capricious
maybe he still had his home
he arrived , and stared
a house that has succumbed to a wildfire is rarely just a little bit destroyed
the damage almost always looks as if the structure had not merely been burned , but also bombed
a water pipe spurted halfheartedly over the ruins
oh , you get to start over , he said
then he crumbled to his knees and sobbed
the weather and climate behind the infernos that wrecked paradise and threaten malibu
the wildfires scorching california in the past few days have been vast , bringing their destruction and lethality to numerous communities across large swaths of the state , including this one in los angeles county and another gigantic burn along the northern mountains
the camp fire , in the sierra nevada foothills north of sacramento , is now the most destructive individual wildfire in californias history
as of saturday , it already had destroyed nearly 7,000 structures in and around the mountain town of paradise and has been blamed for 23 of the 25 overall deaths , though more could come
honea said saturday night that 14 additional bodies were found , bringing the death toll in the northern california fire to 23 , the associated press reported
the victims have not been identified
he said there are reports of about 110 people missing
the smoke , like orange fog , that enveloped chico and surrounding towns friday gave way to a low-lying haze that spread all the way up to redding on saturday , thanks to a shift in winds overnight
pepperdine students sheltered in place as wildfire raged around the malibu campus
surgical nurse nichole jolly , who turned 34 on friday , spent her birthday helping evacuate the patients from paradises only hospital
she didnt know whether her home survived
after the hospital had been cleared , she tried to leave the area but was trapped by smoke and flames
her car caught fire
a call from her husband , in a place where cellphone service is notoriously spotty , came through , and he told me to get out and run.
a bulldozer operator picked her up and took her back to the feather river hospital , where staffers , trapped in place , started a triage area outside because the whole place smelled like burned plastic.
staff members , patients and anyone who could hold a fire extinguisher watched for spot fires
she said about 10 nurses , two doctors and a respiratory therapist spent the next five or six hours treating anyone who reached the hospital
winds eased saturday , but they are expected to increase again sunday
the weather dry air , high winds and no rain is conducive to fires and is forecast to continue until late tuesday
about 200,000 people were displaced by the woolsey fire , which began midafternoon thursday near simi valley , even as fire departments were responding to a second wildfire , called the hill fire , just west of thousand oaks
the woolsey fire proved to be explosive , expanding within 24 hours to some 35,000 acres
it raced from the conejo valley to the pacific ocean , across highway 101 and the santa monica mountains , at speeds that impressed veteran fire officials
its spreading quicker than it used to , said mark lorenzen , chief of the ventura county fire department
they werent surprised
they knew the wind was coming , and when there is strong wind here , there is fire , reliably
but david richardson , deputy chief of the los angeles county fire department , said everyone had expected a lull in the wind friday afternoon , and it didnt materialize
the gusts stayed dangerous
this was an unpredictable fire , burning some houses to their foundations while leaving next-door structures untouched
that was the case in oak park , which abuts the rugged hills separating conejo valley from simi valley
residents were still gradually returning to their neighborhoods saturday , and what they found was a largely intact community pocked with destroyed houses
its just nature
nature makes its choices , said a man walking his dog , too busy on his cellphone to provide his name or any other information
dad stays calm , sings to young daughter during harrowing evacuation from california wildfire
californians have a relationship with fire
they read smoke signals
they will study a fires glow on a ridgeline and forecast their immediate future according to what they smell
they know what to pack
they know to turn their cars around in their driveways for a quick getaway
the embers were largely gone saturday , but the smoke remained inescapable , pooling in low-lying areas
spot fires remained , and the ground smoldered
among the property consumed by flames was paramount ranch , a fake western town used for hbos westworld and other shows dating back more than a half-century
sharon woods , 48 , who owns a winery , lives just a few yards from mcclenahan in malibu lake , and she was horrified by the hellscape around her
her two-story wooden house somehow was spared , with a trail of fire skirting it along the property line
the only things she lost were a couple of garbage cans
shed won the fire lottery
im still completely dazed , she said.
ive been crying for 20 hours.
she surveyed the remnants of the neighborhood with jeremy sugarman , 39 , a landscape architect whose home also survived
in malibu , pepperdine universitys 3,600 undergraduates were ordered to shelter in place as the fire approached
that decision by university officials proved controversial , especially with parents , after the flames reached hillsides near campus
overnight , debate had raged about whether the students were in the safest possible spot or trapped and in danger
the flames had been extinguished near campus by early saturday morning
on saturday , president trump made his first comments on the wildfires , alleging mismanagement of the forests
there is no reason for these massive , deadly and costly forest fires in california except that forest management is so poor
billions of dollars are given each year , with so many lives lost , all because of gross mismanagement of the forests
remedy now , or no more fed payments
a spokesman for gov
jerry brown ( d ) said that more federal forest land has burned than state land , adding that the state has expanded its forestry budget while the trump administration has cut its budget for forest services
later saturday , the president posted a tweet expressing concern for those affected
more than 4,000 are fighting the camp and woolsey fires in california that have burned over 170,000 acres
our hearts are with those fighting the fires , the 52,000 who have evacuated , and the families of the 11 who have died
the destruction is catastrophic
god bless them all
brian rice , president of the california professional firefighters , also responded to trumps earlier tweet
rice said in a statement
back in oak park , richard gwynn , 75 , and his wife , lynda gwynn , 70 , surveyed the burned landscape
she became emotional , looking at a canyon where her children had once played , now blackened by fire
richard gwynn said.
but theres nothing left to burn.
nearby , a rabbit hopped over charred ground
theres one alive
we cant get rid of them , no matter what , lynda gwynn said
