the fbi announced three more suspected pipe bombs were found thursday one in actor robert de niros manhattan office , and two in mail facilities in delaware addressed to former vice president joe biden
over a 72-hour period , devices were also discovered addressed to prominent liberal critics of president trump , including former president barack obama , former secretary of state hillary clinton , and rep. debbie wasserman schultz ( d-fla. )

william f. sweeney jr. , assistant director in charge of the fbi new york field office , asked people to remain vigilant , warning that more devices have been or could be mailed.

they all also had a half-dozen forever stamps , computer-printed address labels and return addresses bearing the misspelled name of wasserman schultz , who chaired the democratic national committee during part of the 2016 presidential campaign
