they met on a dating website for people with hiv and spent five not-entirely-blissful years together
co-workers sometimes saw scratches on mark van dongen , courtesy of berlinah wallaces jealous outbursts
enraged during one fight , wallace had poured boiling water on him
by august 2015 , van dongen had had enough , the bbc reported
he wanted out of the relationship , he told wallace
a little later , he told his ex that he was seeing someone else
thats when , prosecutors say , wallace began researching sulfuric acid
in all , she looked at 82 websites about the corrosive substance , prosecutors said
some of the sites showed bodies scarred black by the acid
she bought a bottle from amazon
about a month after he announced that he was dating again , wallace lured her ex to her home under the guise of rekindling their relationship
the breakup had been an on-again off-again roller coaster , and van dongen wanted to reiterate that he was moving on with his new girlfriend
but he ended up staying the night anyway
and as he lay in bed around 3 a.m. wearing nothing but boxer shorts , wallace stood over him with a glass mug full of acid
she told him , if i ca n't have you , no one can , laughed , then tipped the corrosive substance onto his face and exposed body , the bbc reported
calling the moment an act of pure evil , a british judge on wednesday sentenced wallace , 49 , to a minimum of 12 years in prison for the attack
last year , van dongen ended his life
the acid attack left van dongen with gruesome burns over 25 percent of his body , including most of his face
after the attack , he ran into the streets of westbury park in bristol , half-blind and wearing only his boxers , his screams attracting the attention of neighbors
rachel oaten , who decontaminated the injured man at southmead hospital in bristol , said he let out a bloodcurdling scream when he saw his reflection
but it was n't just his face
the attack ultimately left him paralyzed from the neck down
one leg had to be amputated
and he spent four months in a coma
the only thing he could move with any real precision was his tongue
when detectives asked who had attacked him , he used the organ to spell out the word berlinah.
on the night of the attack , detectives found her at her home , sitting on the sofa , the sun reported
when they asked about van dongen , she motioned to the glass mug on the floor
she told conflicting stories on that night and in her trial
she said she bought the acid to distress some jeans and to deal with a bad smell emanating from her drains
and she painted van dongen as the abusive one and the aggressor that night
she told investigators , then the court , that he had tried to get her to drink the acid , saying it was water
she said in an interview , according to the sun.
he wanted me to , to burn my insides.
she claimed that he had tried to stop her from leaving the apartment and that she had thrown the acid in self-defense , the sun reported
but her sheets told the real story
they were blackened by acid on his side of the bed
in the ensuing years , as wallace awaited her trial , her ex-boyfriend 's suffering spiraled
he spent months in intensive care , then more months in the burn unit
he endured recurrent septic chest infections , intense pain , post-traumatic stress disorder and night terrors , the sun reported
the muscle in one of his arms was slowly eaten away by the acid
paralyzed , he couldnt scratch himself
his father made an 800-mile road trip from belgium each weekend to see him , sometimes sleeping in his car in the hospitals parking lot
the older mans marriage disintegrated under the strain and he went bankrupt , according to the bbc
with the help of a family friend , van dongen was transferred to a hospital in belgium
for him , there were two benefits his father could be with him everyday , and assisted suicide is legal in belgium
doctors had told him that he would need a third tracheotomy , his father said
it would help him breathe but take away his voice
van dongen applied for euthanasia , and a panel of three doctors ruled that his unbearable physical and psychological suffering meant he was eligible
on jan. 2 , 2017 , 15 months after the attack , van dongen ended his life
