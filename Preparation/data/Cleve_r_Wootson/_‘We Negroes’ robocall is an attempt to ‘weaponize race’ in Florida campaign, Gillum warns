an assertion by a white gubernatorial candidate that florida voters ca n't afford to monkey this up by voting for his black opponent was widely viewed as a dog whistle to rally racists
if it were a dog whistle and gop candidate ron desantis denies any racial intent against democrat andrew gillum then a jungle music-scored robo-call that has circulated in florida is more akin to a bullhorn
if nothing else , the minute-long audio clip is a clear sign of how quickly racism subtle in some cases , overt in others has entered the contest to determine who will lead florida
well , hello there , the call begins as the sounds of drums and monkeys can be heard in the background , according to the new york times.
i is andrew gillum
we negroes
done made mud huts while white folk waste a bunch of time making their home out of wood an stone
the speaker goes on to say he 'll pass a law letting african americans evade arrest if the negro know fo sho he did n't do nothin
it is unclear how many people heard the call
in a statement emailed to the washington post , gillum 's spokesman , geoff burgan said this is reprehensible and could only have come from someone with intentions to fuel hatred and seek publicity
please dont give it undeserved attention
people on the other side of the aisle also spoke out against the telephone campaign , which was first reported by the tallahassee democrat
in a tweet , gov
rick scott ( r ) , the current occupant of 700 n. adams st. in tallahassee and a candidate for the u.s. senate , blasted whoever was behind the robo-call
there is no room for any racial politics here in florida none , the tweet said.
florida is a melting pot of people from all over the globe , and we are proud of it
no attempts to divide people by race or ethnicity will be tolerated , from anyone
and a spokesman for desantis a u.s. congressman who has been criticized for his racially tinged comment about gillum a day after tuesday 's primary called the robo-calls disgusting
this is absolutely appalling and disgusting and hopefully whoever is behind this has to answer for this despicable action , stephen lawson , a spokesman for the desantis campaign , said , according to the tampa bay times.
our campaign has and will continue to focus solely on the issues that floridians care about and uniting our state as we continue to build on our success
desantis has said his comments were aimed at gillum 's policies , not his skin color

gillum said sunday that he did n't want the governor 's race to become one of name-calling
i want to make sure that we dont racialize and , frankly , weaponize race as a part of this process , he said on cnn 's state of the union
he added people are taking their cues from desantis , from his campaign and from donald trump
and on nbc 's meet the press sunday , host chuck todd asked gillum if he thinks desantis is racist
gillum replied i have not called him a racist , but his rhetoric in my opinion has to be toned down
i wo n't get into the gutter and name call
the desantis campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comments on gillum 's remarks on cnn
if elected , gillum would be florida 's first black governor
a disclaimer at the end of the robo-call says it was produced by the road to power , a white-supremacist and anti-semitic group based in idaho
the southern poverty law center has noted a recent rise in robo-calls throughout the country , describing them as a new , high-tech , computer-delivered brand of hate , according to the tampa bay times
the road to power is also the group behind the attempt to turn the killing of mollie tibbetts in iowa into anti-immigration policy and a 2018 campaign talking point
tibbetts , a 20-year-old university of iowa student , disappeared in july while on a jog around her hometown
authorities found her body in a cornfield a month later , after being led there by a man they said confessed to chasing tibbetts after seeing her jogging , then dragging her body into a field just outside the town of brooklyn , iowa
mollie tibbettss dad dont use her death to push views she believed were profoundly racist
the suspect , cristhian rivera , is an undocumented immigrant who worked on a dairy farm , and conservatives said tibbetts 's death highlights the need for stronger immigration laws and even a wall on the southern border
tibbetts 's family has pushed back against that argument , with her father speaking favorably of the local hispanic community
if , after her life has now been brutally stolen from her , she could be brought back to life for just one moment and asked , 'what do you think now
mollie tibbetts would say , 'kill them all , an iowa robo-call says.
well , we do n't have to kill them all , but we do have to deport them all
the aztec hybrids known as mestizos are low-iq , bottom-feeding savages and is why the country they infest are crime-ridden failures
according to the des moines register , the man producing the robo-calls is named scott rhodes , of sandpoint , idaho
he has been linked to similar campaigns in california alexandria , va. and charlottesville
rhodes could not immediately be reached for comment
