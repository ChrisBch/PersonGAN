all but one of the 239 people on the doomed malaysia airlines flight 370 had probably been unconscious incapacitated by the sudden depressurization of the boeing 777 and had no way of knowing they were on an hours-long , meandering path to their deaths
along that path , a panel of aviation experts speculated sunday , was a brief but telling detour near penang , malaysia , the home town of captain zaharie ahmad shah
on two occasions , whoever was in control of the plane and was probably the only one awake tipped the craft to the left
the experts believe zaharie , the plane 's pilot , was taking a final look
that is the chilling theory that the team of analysts assembled by australia 's 60 minutes have posited about the final hours of mh370
the conclusions have not been backed by any official findings from investigations into the mystery surrounding the march 2014 flight
but the experts on the 60 minutes show sought to draw the most likely scenario of the plane 's fate from the little that is known
they suspect that the plane 's 2014 disappearance and apparent crash was a suicide by the 53-year-0ld zaharie and a premeditated act of mass murder
but first , the experts said , they believe that zaharie depressurized the plane , knocking out anyone aboard who was n't wearing an oxygen mask
that would explain the silence from the plane as it veered wildly off course no mayday from the craft 's radio , no final goodbye texts , no attempted emergency calls that failed to connect
that would also explain how whoever was in control had time to maneuver the plane to its final location
the wreckage has not been found , though hundreds of millions of dollars have gone into the four-year search
the secret of what happened in the final moments of the ill-fated flight and the motive behind it all probably died with its passengers and pilot
but the 60 minutes team which included aviation specialists , the former australian transport safety bureau chief in charge of investigating mh370 's crash , and an oceanographer put forth what they believe is the most likely theory
bones discovered on a pacific island belong to amelia earhart , a new forensic analysis claims
zaharie 's suspected suicide might explain an oddity about the plane 's final flight path that unexpected turn to the left
flight 370 disappeared march 8 , 2014 , shortly after leaving kuala lumpur , bound for beijing
the craft is thought to have crashed in the far southern indian ocean
the governments of malaysia , china and australia called off the official search in january 2017
the australian transport safety bureau 's final report said authorities were no closer to knowing the reasons for the planes disappearance or the exact location of its wreckage
but the 60 minutes experts tried to answer one of the biggest questions surrounding the flight how could a modern aircraft tracked by radar and satellites simply disappear
because , they say , zaharie wanted it to
and the veteran pilot , who had nearly 20,000 hours of flight experience and had built a flight simulator in his home , knew exactly how to do it
for example , at one point , he flew near the border of malaysia and thailand , crisscrossing into the airspace of both , hardy said
but neither country was likely to see the plane as a threat because it was on the edge of their airspace
an unprecedented missing aircraft mystery
in light of the new analysis , the atsb should abandon its ghost flight theory about the plane 's demise , said mike keane , a former military pilot and the former chief pilot at britain-based easyjet , according to news.com.au
that theory says the plane was on autopilot and that zaharie and his co-pilot were incapacitated when the flight crashed
theories about zaharie 's culpability are not new
zaharie and co-pilot fariq abdul hamid were prime suspects in the plane 's disappearance from the beginning , according to news.com.au
there were rumors that zaharie 's marriage was ending and that he downed the plane after learning that his wife was about to leave , the news site said
another theory was that he hijacked the plane in protest of the jailing of anwar ibrahim , who was then the opposition leader in malaysia
a group called the chinese martyrs brigade has also claimed responsibility for the downing , although skeptical officials called this a hoax
two men on the plane were flying with phony passports , but one was apparently an asylum seeker , and neither had terrorism links
the theory posited on 60 minutes has something in common with previous ones about the fate of mh370 , said a skeptical sara norton , whose brother , paul weeks , died on the plane they 're all guesswork
norton told new zealand news website stuff.co.nz on tuesday.
it 's all assumption and supposition and opinion.
the wreckage , of course , might corroborate or dispel theories about what caused the crash , and crews were still looking for it as recently as this year
the latest attempt to discover it was a $ 70 million effort by a texas company called ocean infinity , according to the associated press
the mission scanned 500 square miles a day during a three-month search
ocean infinity chief executive oliver plunkett said the company 's technology had performed exceptionally well and collected significant amounts of high-quality data.
still , it found no trace of mh370
