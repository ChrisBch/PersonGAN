the transformer megatron chased an allspark-snatching sam witwicky through the dilapidated , graffiti-filled train station in 2007
two years before that , the world saw a climactic fight between ewan mcgregor and a ewan mcgregor clone in the island , which is apparently a car chase away from the motor city
the cinematic allure of the building , designed by the same people who designed new yorks grand central station , is simple michigan central depot was once grand
now it is decidedly not
after the no trespassing signs were put up in 1988 , the train station became another symbol of decay in a city that had more than enough
infamously in detroit , single-family homes were once sold for $ 1 , and the nba team with detroit on its jersey spent four decades playing a half-hour from the city center
but now bay will have to find another symbol of a decaying america for his explosions and invasions
matthew moroun , son of building owner manuel matty moroun , told the associated press on monday that ford motor co. has bought and will redevelop the 500,000-square-foot , 18-story former station that has been closed for two decades
ford is expected to disclose details about its redevelopment plan next week , the first successful one after years of failed discussions about what should happen to the property
ford hopes the corktown historic district just west of downtown detroit and the former train station can give it urban credibility with young technology workers who might otherwise go to work in silicon valley or other attractive tech centers , the detroit news reported
these surreal nightscapes are a photographers ode to detroit
of course , having a soon-to-be-renovated train station compete with a region will be a difficult task
that , of course , has been the plan since 1913
it was designed by the warren & wetmore and reed & stem firms , the same people who brought the world new yorks grand central station , according to the news
the train station makes up the base of the building and is topped by an 18-story office tower
the main waiting room , the place megatron crashed through in search of the allspark , is modeled after a roman bathhouse
the train station was built a dozen years after henry ford established his successful automobile company and shortly after the big three automakers first established companies in or near detroit , according to the detroit historical society
by 1950 , detroit was americas fourth-largest city , with 1.85 million people , many of whom owed their livelihoods to the success of the u.s. auto industry , according to the week magazine
but detroit was beset by racial violence and riots in the 1960s
and an oil crisis in the next decade increased americans desire for cheap , fuel-efficient foreign cars
the pistons left in 1978 , although they returned last year
the train station closed in 1988 and was tenantless for two decades although not necessarily empty
it became home to generations of homeless people , urban explorers and anybody who thought strips of copper or pieces of facade ripped off a century-old building would be valuable to scrap dealers or pawnbrokers
a homeless man who lived in the building once gave a profanity-filled tour of it to a camera crew but said even he was afraid to go in parts of the buildings basement
the morouns they also own a bridge linking detroit to canada and bought the building in 1992 became primarily known as the family that owned the decaying train station west of downtown
they had gotten pitches about what to do with the space , matthew moroun said , but they were all far-fetched aquariums , beer halls , vertical farming
in 2009 , the detroit city council passed a resolution that asked the morouns to demolish the structure , the news reported
the family simply ignored the request
nearly a decade later , matthew moroun stood in front of the building and used his speech to take on the buildings detractors
although my father and i believed in this building and detroit , many others did not
the new york times labeled its iconic facade as an example of how far the city had fallen
the past detroit city council members in 2009 voted , resolved and ordered its demolition
at least one of our major detroit newspapers published an editorial advocating for leveling it
the deal is complete
the future of the depot is assured
the next steward of the building is the right one for its future
