her name is susan westwood
but her racist confrontation with two black women that led to her viral moment and eventual arrest earned her a nickname that stuck southparksusan
westwood , 51 , has joined the pantheon of white people accosting people of color and calling police about trivial or nonexistent concerns
in this case , it involved a black woman from westwoods exclusive charlotte community and the womans sister , who were waiting at night for aaa assistance to help with a car that wouldnt start oct. 19
westwoods racist and apparent booze-fueled tirade in which she ranted that mary and leisa garris did not belong there , and that she was white and hot was captured on video by the sisters and exploded across social media
westwood referenced owning a gun and accused the sisters , among other things , of selling drugs
the incident led spectrum communication to fire westwood
the charlotte-mecklenburg police department said
westwood surrendered to police saturday three days after the warrant was issued and was taken to the brunswick county sheriffs department
she was released on $ 500 bond , the department said , and has a hearing scheduled for dec. 19 , according to court records
westwood could not be reached to comment
it wasnt immediately clear whether she had an attorney
the 911 recordings released by authorities reveal westwoods false and racist claims about the garris sisters
police later confirmed that leisa garris lives in the apartment complex
but at the time , westwood was suspicious when they said they were waiting for aaa to arrive
bbq becky , permit patty and cornerstore caroline too cutesy for those white women calling police on black people
the call lasted more than five minutes
at one point , the dispatcher appeared to doubt the authenticity of westwoods claims and the severity of her allegation that the women had photographed her
at one point , he even told her that taking her picture was not a crime
leisa garris also made calls to 911 during and after the incident
but people who suddenly were on the receiving end of racial harassment have been empowered by a new weapon cellphones
recordings of the incidents have sparked viral videos and spontaneous hashtagged nicknames for people such as bbqbecky and permitpatty , who have been scorned publicly on social media and , as in westwoods case , fired from their jobs
although the incident will probably stain westwoods reputation ( and google search results ) for some time , it was harrowing for mary garris to encounter such bold and naked prejudice
