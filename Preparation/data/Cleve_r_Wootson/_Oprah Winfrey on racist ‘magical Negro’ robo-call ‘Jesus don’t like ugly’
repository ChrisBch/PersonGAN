oprah winfrey has responded to the racist robo-call that uses her name in a ploy against georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams , a democrat who is trying to become the states first black female governor
as you might have guessed , she is not impressed
the robo-calls , which georgians began hearing last week , according to reports , brought an 11th-hour infusion of old-fashioned racism to the gubernatorial election in georgia
the robo-call begins , before spewing nearly 60 seconds of racism coupled with a dash of anti-semitism
its unclear how many oprah robo-calls have been received in georgia

the robo-call labels abrams a poor mans aunt jemima , a reference to the black woman on the front of the pancake mix box , an image that has itself been derided as a racist symbol
it suggests that winfrey is a media construction made to trick fat , white women into voting
and it mocks what winfrey has called one of her all-time happiest moments in media
responding on instagram , where she has 15 million followers , winfrey wrote the antidote to hate ... vote your love.

the abrams campaign called the robo-calls a desperate and vile attempt to sway voters using poisonous thinking.
abrams spokeswoman abigail collazo said in a statement , which tried to link the robo-calls to a tone set by president trump and abramss republican opponent , brian kemp
in a statement to the hill , kemp called the robo-call vile , racist and absolutely disgusting.
i stand against any person or organization that peddles this type of unbridled hate and unapologetic bigotry , he said
but abrams said that kemp has been racially insensitive in the past
she also addressed the racist attacks in the robo-call

the insidious tone of the poor-audio call was at odds with winfreys words on the campaign trail
she and abrams are both black women originally from mississippi , and the media titan spoke of the sacrifices their ancestors had to make to obtain the right to vote
she told voters
well , hello there , that call begins , as the sounds of drums and monkeys can be heard in the background , according to the new york times.
i is andrew gillum.
the speaker goes on to say gillum will pass a law letting african americans evade arrest if the negro know fo sho he didnt do nothin
