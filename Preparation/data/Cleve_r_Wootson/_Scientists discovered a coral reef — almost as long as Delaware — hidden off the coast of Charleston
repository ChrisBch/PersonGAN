but for all our knowledge of how to get over the atlantic , we still know decidedly little about what , exactly , is beneath it
exhibit a , it would seem , is a discovery made this week 160 miles off the coast of charleston an enormous series of coral reefs that , combined , are nearly the length of delaware
scientists say it may have been growing on the ocean floor for as long as modern humans have been on the planet
erik cordes , a temple university biology professor and the expeditions chief scientist , told the washington post.
and the function of the reefs , in terms of recycling nutrients , is critical to fuel surface productivity and the fisheries we rely on
the find is about more than just raw science
the trump administration wants to allow the energy industry to drill offshore , and researchers hope to be able to tell policymakers which areas should be off-limits
scientists with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , the bureau of ocean energy management , and the u.s. geological survey are on a 15-day sea voyage aboard the research vessel atlantis
they make almost daily trips to the sea floor aboard a specially-equipped submersible named alvin
their curiosity was piqued by something found a month ago by researchers on the vessel okeanos mounds of what turned out to be coral debris , with living coral growing along the top edge
cordes told the washington post
they never dreamed we were looking at structures created almost entirely of coral building up over thousands , or even hundreds of thousands , of years
we have yet to find a single rock on any of these features
just coral for miles and miles.
a military historians find could unlock the mystery of 136 sailors missing since wwii
video posted by the woods hole oceanographic institution captured details of the dive in a time lapse
at first , small pieces of coral dotted the seafloor
but , over time , large pieces of living coral can be seen , some of it snatched up by the submersibles arms and placed into sample containers
the discovery comes as the trump administration has proposed rolling back bans on ocean drilling
the move would reinstate offshore drilling leases , and has been publicly opposed by more than 140 municipalities
in january , the trump administration unveiled a plan that would permit companies to drill in waters on the u.s. continental shelf , including protected areas of the atlantic and arctic oceans
the bureau of ocean and energy management has identified 47 potential areas where industry companies can buy leases between 2019 and 2024 , when the proposed period would begin and end , according to the washington posts darryl fears
its still unclear where industry insiders would want to drill and boem studies help determine which areas are most vulnerable , officials said
cordes told the post that the reef appears to be one of those areas
