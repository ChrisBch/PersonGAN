the illusion is called lucky 13.
thats how many volunteers are plucked from david copperfields audience and ushered into a cage onstage
the cage is then covered and hoisted into the air as the famed illusionist engages in some funny back-and-forth banter with the audience
the trick ends when copperfield tells the rest of the audience to turn around and say hello to the grinning , waving people who are most definitely no longer in the cage
but copperfields most successful maneuver may have come when he escaped financial liability after one of the disappeared people slipped and fell during a 2013 performance on the las vegas strip then sued the magician for millions
a nevada jury on tuesday found the multimillionaire magician negligent , but said he wasnt financially responsible for a british tourists injuries during the act , the associated press reported
the verdict means gavin cox and his wife , minh-hahn cox , can not seek monetary damages against the 61-year-old magician , the mgm grand hotel where he performs , or a construction firm that was performing renovations at the time
but copperfield didnt emerge entirely unscathed
on the witness stand in a las vegas courtroom , the man who has made an estimated $ 800 million performing illusions was forced to reveal the secret behind one of his signature tricks
it basically involves flashing lights , lots of running and some confused kitchen workers
david copperfield is the magic force behind a must-read congressional resolution
as the washington posts travis m. andrews reported lucky 13 works like this after the curtains drop over the cage , stagehands waving flashlights hurry the participants out through dark and hidden passageways that snake through and out of the resort
everyone reenters the building via a kitchen
then , they sneak into the theater from the back as everyone elses attention is focused on copperfield
cox said he and the other 12 participants had no idea where they were going , or that they would spend part of their evening jogging through service corridors of a vegas strip resort
some of those dark passageways were filled with dust and debris from the renovations , coxs attorneys argued , and someone copperfield , the hotel or the construction company should have known what would happen
during the dash , cox fell and was taken to a hospital with a dislocated shoulder
later , he claimed he suffered chronic pain and said doctors found a lesion on his brain
he said his medical bills totaled more than $ 400,000 , nbc reported
pictures of cox , who had come to las vegas to celebrate his birthday , showed him in a hospital bed under a blanket , his right arm heavily bandaged
as for that meandering dash from the cage to the back of the theater , coxs attorneys likened it to an obstacle course a dark route in which the floor changed from carpet to cement to linoleum
the alley , coxs lawyers argued , was coated with construction dust
over five years of legal wrangling , copperfield fought a battle on two fronts
he wanted the jurors , or whatever other legal authorities there were , to believe that he was not responsible for coxs fall and injuries
he said he had even walked the path a few minutes before cox did
but the illusionist also tried to convince a judge that he did not have to reveal the secrets of his trick
but the judge disagreed , arguing that if it was a secret , it wasnt a particularly well-kept one
copperfield has performed the trick with 55,000 participants over the years , according to nbc
every one of them is well aware of what happens when the curtain is dropped over the cage
and now , so is the rest of the world
