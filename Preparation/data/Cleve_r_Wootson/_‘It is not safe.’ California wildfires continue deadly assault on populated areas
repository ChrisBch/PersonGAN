thousand oaks , calif. as authorities on sunday continued to search for bodies in the destroyed northern california town of paradise , fire weather returned to southern california , with parched air pouring down from the mountains and generating flare-ups from the historic woolsey fire
dc-10 air tankers fought the wind gusts to drop bright-red flame retardant on rugged , unburned terrain as the fire invaded canyons where california meets the pacific ocean
at midday sunday , the combined efforts of several thousand firefighters seemed to have the woolsey fire , now a protracted disaster , in check
but the red-flag warnings critical fire conditions were forecast to last across the region until 5 p.m. tuesday
fire chiefs had warned that the dreaded santa ana winds would be back around 10 a.m. sunday , and they were right
the winds kicked up just as officials were holding a news conference warning that conditions remained dangerous
as they spoke , a massive plume of smoke rose in the southern sky from the direction of malibu
the woolsey fire had burned 83,000 acres by sunday morning , with just 10 percent containment
in northern california , the camp fire , which wiped out paradise , has been blamed for 29 deaths , with five more bodies discovered in homes sunday and another in a vehicle
that death toll ties the camp fire with the deadliest in state history , the 1933 griffith park wildfire in los angeles
the camp fire burned nearly 7,000 buildings and is the most destructive individual fire in california history
sheriffs deputies and officials from the coroners office have been examining charred homes that have been too hot for body-sniffing dogs
butte county sheriff kory l. honea said late sunday that authorities were trying to account for 228 people reported missing by friends or family members
honea said some may be in shelters
he urged citizens to tell authorities if and when they find a person who had been unaccounted for
some of the victims died in their cars as they attempted to escape
authorities have not released the names of victims , and paradise , a city of 27,000 popular with retirees , is quarantined
the city is without power and has no operational businesses , and few residents have returned
paradise has been essentially obliterated
honeas office has ordered an additional dna lab truck and received help from anthropologists at california state university at chico for the time-consuming and daunting task of identifying victims
in some cases , investigators have found just pieces of bone
although the fire had been 25 percent contained by sunday , high temperatures and gusty winds made the weather optimal for the northern california fire to spread for at least another day
president trump alternated between offering sympathy for displaced people and firefighters and lashing out at californias leaders over what he deemed poor forest management
he tweeted sunday morning , echoing a refrain that he has frequently leveled at california officials including on saturday and threatening to withhold federal money
officials shot back that increasingly destructive fires are a result of global warming , which has led to weather that dries out vegetation and turns large swaths of grassland into a tinderbox
the woolsey fire began in a canyon of that name near the city of simi valley , and it spread primarily through open terrain with few trees and a great deal of waist-high and knee-high shrubs and grasses
jerry brown ( d ) said at an afternoon news conference.
things like this and worse.
he repeatedly cited climate change as a factor and said those who deny it are complicit in the disasters
the chickens are coming home to roost
this is real here , brown said
brown had earlier requested a presidential major disaster declaration , which would make the hardest-hit communities eligible for housing , unemployment and other support programs and allow state and local governments to repair or replace fire-damaged facilities and infrastructure
the federal emergency management agency has granted a state request for emergency aid
the woolsey fire has been linked to two deaths , both still under investigation , and its effects have been broad
los angeles county fire chief daryl osby said
he said the footprint of the woolsey fire contains many unburned areas that are vulnerable to embers stoked by wind gusts that could reach 45 mph
the immediate concern was that the fire would be pushed by the santa ana winds south along the pacific coast , from malibu to topanga canyon and on to pacific palisades and the doorstep of santa monica
the only thing were not concerned about is the ocean , osby said
on sunday afternoon , he was somewhat more upbeat , saying firefighters had had some huge successes in suppressing flare-ups over the course of the day
the officials pounded home a warning to residents dont go back into the mandatory evacuation zones
many residents have been standing their ground , refusing to evacuate and saying they will defend their property
fire officials want them out of the way because of the scale of the response and the need to use heavy equipment and fire hoses
they point out that embers can fly a mile from the front edge of a fire and trap people amid the flames
and these fires are hard to outrun because they have been whipped by heavy winds
said nick schuler , a cal fire deputy chief , as he looked at the billowing cloud of smoke over malibu.
you cant outrun a tornado.
despite those warnings , people have drifted home to mandatory evacuation zones , some fearing looters , though only a couple of arrests have been made , officials said
said chief john benedict of the los angeles county sheriffs department.
please , please be patient with us.
the twin disasters in northern and southern california have provided a reminder that climate change is altering the basic equations of fire suppression
when ventura county fire chief mark lorenzen stopped in the morning to visit one of his firefighters at home , he noticed a plant burning in the yard
it was an ice plant
its a succulent thats supposed to be fire-resistant
and local officials are looking toward the next potential consequence of the wildfires as winter rains loom the shadow disaster of mudslides
