yazoo city , miss
for the past five months , u.s. senate candidate mike espy has tried to remind mississippians how he has served them in the past a son of the delta with three terms in the u.s. house who spent time as bill clintons agriculture secretary
one of his opponents is hearkening to another version of the past republican chris mcdaniel , a conservative fond of provocative statements whose yard signs boast the stainless banner the second flag of the confederate states of america
the states appointed sen. cindy hyde-smith , a republican , is the other candidate who will be on the special-election ballot she took over from thad cochran , who resigned in ill health in april
the winner will fill the remaining two years of cochrans term if no candidate wins a majority , the race heads to a nov. 27 runoff
espy , 64 , whose family has deep roots in mississippi , must draw large numbers of black and democratic voters to the polls
but his biggest challenge will be persuading a large enough swath of others , including white moderates , to ignore the two main republicans on the ballot and vote for a democrat who happens to be black
mississippi politics is black and white , said joe thomas jr. , the democratic county chair from yazoo county , which includes espys hometown , yazoo city
espy is one of three prominent african american candidates running for statewide offices in the south in november
andrew gillum of florida and stacey abrams of georgia won democratic nominations for governor and are seeking to become the first african american chief executives of their respective states
but the south has not suddenly morphed into a post-racial utopia
some politicians and their supporters have used rhetoric about confederate statues and symbols , the not-so-distant memory of a white supremacist march in charlottesville last year and loaded language to stir up deep-seated divisions and mobilize specific voters
within hours of gillums primary victory in florida , his republican opponent , former rep. ron desantis , told reporters that voters couldnt afford to monkey this up by electing gillum
a few days later , some florida voters heard a jungle-music-infused robo-call insulting african americans over background sounds of drums and monkeys
gillum has accused his opponents of trying to weaponize race.
and it is exemplified by mcdaniels tactics
mcdaniel is an ardent supporter of the confederate flag and recently polled his twitter followers on whether in light of all the political correctness and leftist hysteria , history should consider robert e. lee a hero or a villain
( the final tally 91 percent said villain 9 percent said hero )
during a september appearance on msnbcs morning joe , mcdaniel was asked what he would say to black voters who are skeptical of him
the comment drew boos from the live crowd at ole miss
mcdaniel told a mostly white group of supporters gathered at a community center in pearl , miss. , the accusations that he was making his campaign about race were an effort by his opponents to thwart him
his town hall meeting erupted in applause when he said hillary clinton deserved to be in a federal penitentiary and that illegal immigration was one of the nations top national security issues
mcdaniel defended his support of the confederate flag and statues and noted that mississippians affirmed keeping the confederate symbol on the states flag in a 2001 referendum
he said he thinks espy is a fine person , but mississippi wont send a liberal democrat to the u.s. senate.
the demography of mississippi requires that espy play down the role of race
blacks make up roughly 38 percent of the population , the largest percentage of all the former confederate states , but nowhere near a majority
espy noted that in his other bids for office , he has won substantial support from white voters
forty percent of them supported him in his last congressional bid , in 1992 , up from 12 percent in his first bid for congress , exit polls showed
for espy , going after white moderates is occasionally a matter of linguistic gymnastics
instead of talking about the affordable care act , for example , espy focuses on rural hospitals that have had to close because state leaders wont accept medicaid funds an expansion offered by the aca , also known as obamacare
he reminds voters of the time he endorsed republican haley barbour for governor a sign , he says , he will work with anyone who has ideas that are good for mississippi
the need for careful navigation was learned in childhood
espys grandfather , thomas jefferson huddlesworth , made his fortune running dozens of funeral and nursing homes across mississippi
he started the afro american sons and daughters fraternal organization , which operated the first black hospital in mississippi
nearly a century later , huddlesworth is still remembered as the first black man in the delta to own a cadillac
he also started a newspaper for blacks , which he used to invoke the importance of getting an education and a job or joining a social club
but he shied away from some of the most incendiary issues of the jim crow era and the civil rights movement , espy said , because hed be lynched the next day.
in his most visible sign of calibration , espy has declined to go on offense against president trump , as other democrats have , for fear of alienating potential crossover voters
instead , he has emphasized that he is a conservative democrat who will work with anyone
but even that strategy is risky , said marvin king , a political scientist at the university of mississippi who specializes in racial and ethnic politics
also problematic is espys association with the clintons
a few weeks into his fourth congressional term , espy was confirmed as president bill clintons agriculture secretary
he resigned a year later amid allegations that he had received improper gifts
shortly afterward , he was indicted , although ultimately acquitted
hyde-smith , who has been endorsed by trump , said that negative incident is enduring for mississippi voters
that sentiment was echoed by people who attended mcdaniels town hall meeting
marc allen , a 62-year-old air force veteran from pearl , said he was leaning toward mcdaniel because he didnt trust hyde-smiths conservative bona fides
he said he had not done much research on espy but did not like that espy had been a clinton appointee
cristen hemmins , an espy supporter who is white , said he has something other statewide democratic candidates have lacked name recognition
espy said he hopes his election could change the states view of itself
mississippi consistently ranks below almost every other state in measures of socioeconomic success , including obesity rates and educational attainment
