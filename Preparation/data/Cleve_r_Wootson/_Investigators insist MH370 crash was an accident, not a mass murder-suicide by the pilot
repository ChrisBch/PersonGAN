a despondent capt
zaharie ahmad shah , troubled over the end of his marriage or some other unbearable sadness , was the only person awake on the doomed plane full of unconscious people , one theory goes
the suicidal pilot disabled communications on malaysia airlines flight 370 , took a final pass over his home town , then torpedoed the boeing 777 into the indian ocean , experts insisted
a competing theory , the official one posited by investigators , says that everybody on the plane the captain , his co-pilot , more than 200 passengers was unconscious as the uncontrolled craft ran out of fuel and plunged into the sea
the disappearance of mh370 was a tragedy , government investigators say , but an accidental one
the back-and-forth comes after a panel of aviation experts assembled by the australian edition of 60 minutes put forth a new theory about the final hours of the flight
the man in charge of the australian government 's investigation has struck back , saying the new theory has holes of its own
that claim is that zaharie , a veteran pilot , depressurized the plane after turning off its transponder
shortly afterward , everyone else on the plane was knocked out by oxygen deprivation , unwittingly being ferried to their deaths
the reason for zaharie 's supposed suicidal ideation
there were rumors that his marriage was ending and his wife was about to leave him
the 60 minutes experts theory attempted to answer one of the biggest questions surrounding the flight how could a modern aircraft tracked by radar and satellites simply disappear
because , they say , zaharie wanted it to
and the pilot , who had nearly 20,000 hours of flight experience and had built a flight simulator in his home , knew exactly how to do it
shortly after the 60 minutes episode aired in australia , critics of the australian transport safety bureau 's investigation began to speak out
but people on the other side of the debate have said that there are holes in the suicide-by-pilot theory , including the basic biological difficulty of flying a depressurized plane
the atsb 's peter foley told lawmakers at a hearing in canberra on tuesday , according to the guardian
he said a similar situation occurred on a cargo plane in the united states nearly 25 years ago
still , foley conceded to the australian legislators tuesday that the mh370 suicide-by-pilot theory was plausible and that the atsb had listened to experts who supported the controlled ditching theory
and the death-by-pilot theory adherents have an answer for something that has vexed investigators for years a circumstantial but chilling explanation for an unexpected turn the plane made while passing over zaharie 's malaysian home town
the secret of what happened in the final moments of the ill-fated flight and the motive behind it all probably died with its passengers and pilot
the wreckage , of course , might corroborate or dispel theories about what caused the crash but it has not been found , though hundreds of millions of dollars have gone into the four-year search
the governments of malaysia , china and australia called off the official search in january 2017
the atsb 's final report said authorities were no closer to knowing the reasons for the planes disappearance or the exact location of its wreckage
the latest attempt to discover it was a private effort by a texas company called ocean infinity , according to the associated press
ocean infinity chief executive oliver plunkett said the company 's technology had performed exceptionally well and collected significant amounts of high-quality data.
still , it found no trace of mh370 , and on wednesday , the australian broadcasting corporation reported that malaysia 's new transport minister said ocean infinity 's search will end next week
