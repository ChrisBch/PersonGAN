ben bowling 's graduation speech was one of the rare instances where electoral polling numbers can help us understand humor
the 18-year-old is the valedictorian of the bell county high school class of 2018
the southeastern kentucky school is about 80 miles north of knoxville , tenn
the closest a 21st-century democratic presidential candidate has come to winning the hearts and minds of the people of bell county , ky. , was in 2004 , when john f. kerry got 39 percent of people there to punch a ticket for him
trump might be able to pardon himself
but hed probably regret it
every other race has been ( more of ) a landslide by whoever happened to be on the republican side of the ballot nearly 71 percent for john mccain in 2008 , according to the state 's board of elections
mitt romney got 76 percent in 2012 , and donald trump received an overwhelming 82 percent of bell county 's votes in 2016
on saturday , bowling was slated to give a speech before his cap-and-gown-wearing peers and their families , as he noted in one fourth-wall breaking segment
this is the part of my speech where i share some inspirational quotes i found on google , bowling said , before doling out the best the search engine could find
do n't just get involved
fight for your seat at the table
better yet , fight for a seat at the head of the table.
donald j. trump
the crowd went wild , according to a video bowling shared with the louisville courier-journal
their applause for the commander in chief nearly drowned out bowling 's next statement just kidding
that was barack obama
the applause died down to silence
but secretly , a few people in the audience were chuckling at the partisan bait-and-switch
crowd cheers when kentucky hs valedictorian ben bowling quotes trump , then groans when he reveals the inspirational quote was actually from barack obama
y'all , no lie the valedictorian just quoted trump and everyone cheered ... then he told us that it was actually an obama quote
best part of the day
i 'm rolling , tweeted alisha russell , one of the people in the audience , according to the courier-journal
the joke 's deflating effect was not lost on the speaker , who rolled onto his next quote in silence
the crowd erupted in applause and before they could even finish clapping i said i was kidding , and the applause quickly died , bowling later told the newspaper
i just thought it was a really good quote
most people wouldnt like it if i used it , so i thought id use donald trumps name
it is southeastern kentucky after all
bowling could not immediately be reached for comment
obama should be arrested for implying trump needs a filter , fox business host suggests
the quote he found on google was a remark obama made at a commencement ceremony in 2012
speaking to graduates of barnard college in new york , he said now more than ever , america needs what you , the class of 2012 , has to offer
after decades of slow , steady , extraordinary progress , you are now poised to make this the century where women shape not only their own destiny but the destiny of this nation and of this world
but how far your leadership takes this country , how far it takes this world well , that will be up to you
youve got to want it
it will not be handed to you
that 's obligatory
( laughter )
bear with me
my first piece of advice is this dont just get involved
fight for your seat at the table
better yet , fight for a seat at the head of the table
bowling 's speech in that corner of the bluegrass state was n't the only time trump-centric politics have invaded a commencement exercise
beginning six months after trump was elected president , commencement exercise after commencement exercise became a battleground for promoting or protesting the president 's policies
in may 2017 , john cornyn , a republican senator from texas who was then on trump 's shortlist to lead the fbi , was dropped as commencement speaker at the historically black texas southern university
in an online petition , students said cornyn 's views were racist and antithetical to the beliefs of many of the students there
they had threatened to boycott their own graduation
students at bethune-cookman had also threatened to boycott education secretary betsy devos 's commencement address , but administrators did not act on their petitions
instead , the students booed and turned their backs on devos and administrators
ultimately , the university 's president interrupted devos 's speech and told students , if this behavior continues , your degrees will be mailed to you
that did n't happen to bowling in kentucky
he finished his speech , snapped some graduation pictures and received no major backlash from administrators , peers or parents and is looking forward to going to the university of kentucky later this year
i 'm really excited to go to college , bowling told the courier-journal later
there 's more freedom in college and there 's also way more places to eat in lexington
