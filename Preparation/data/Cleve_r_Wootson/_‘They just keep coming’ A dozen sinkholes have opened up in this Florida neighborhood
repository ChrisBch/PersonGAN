for a florida homeowner , few things are more anxiety-inducing than the sight of a sinkhole , sucking in grass and concrete a few feet away from a home unable to move out of the way
but a neighborhood in ocala , fla. , is enduring something out of a homeowners nightmare
at least a dozen sinkholes are threatening homes and draining all the water out of a retention pond in the fore ranch community
neighbors and a prominent geologist worry that there is a bigger threat more sinkholes may form , or they may combine into a mega-sinkhole
they just keep coming , resident maren pinder told cbs-affiliate wftv.
are we safe
we dont know.
the giant dots in the landscape began appearing april 25 , although there were neighborhood reports of a sinkhole problem as far back as 2012 , experts say
in the past week , several cars have been swallowed by the sinkholes , although no people have been injured , the miami herald reported
and all the buildings in the fore ranch development are still standing only one had to be evacuated because it is too close to a hole , displacing eight families , meghan shay , of the ocala police department , told abc-affiliate wcjb
but the scariest thing may be what is yet to come
the worst-case scenario , however , could leave more gaping holes in the landscape or just one very big one
sinkhole forms in front of mar-a-lago metaphors pour in
wilshaw told the washington post
what has been a petrifying week for the people of fore ranch is the result of eons of geological weathering and two decades of development , wilshaw said
a good chunk of florida bedrock is made up of porous rocks such as limestone or sandstone , which can dissolve over time as they interact with acid naturally found in rainwater , according to the florida department of environmental protection
as the limestone dissipates , the sand and clay and dirt above it sink , filling in the gaps
the process takes thousands of years , but can be accelerated by heavy rain , say , from a hurricane or a tropical storm
the process that ultimately forms a sinkhole has been going on for millennia , long before florida was florida , and contributes to other underground cavities , such as the springs and caverns that dot the state
but now there are houses and roads and golf courses in places that used to be open land , turning a naturally occurring geological formation into a disaster capable of swallowing someones house , wilshaw said
construction on the community that would become fore ranch began in earnest in 2004 , and developers built two retention ponds at the end of a system that funneled rainwater from roofs and streets , the geologist said
but that aboveground transformation had unseen effects on how water drained below ground , which , for obvious reasons , can be difficult to ascertain
in 2012 , after tropical storm debbie , nearly 14 sinkholes formed around one of the lakes , wilshaw said
and last week , areas near the communitys other retention pond became dotted with sinkholes , including several that completely drained the water
for people who live in fore ranch , the gaping voids mean an uncertain future
theyre hoping to avoid anything like what happened in the nearby community of land o lakes , where a sinkhole swallowed all of one house and most of another last summer , a tragedy caught on video that rocketed around the world
to prevent that , crews have been seen in ocala all week , using drilling machines and geological equipment to ascertain the scope of the problem and , residents hope , to come up with a solution
until that happens , all residents can do is warily watch the holes
