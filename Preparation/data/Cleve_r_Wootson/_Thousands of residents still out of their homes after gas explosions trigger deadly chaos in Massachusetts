lawrence , mass
the blasts , which led to scores of simultaneous structure fires across three towns in the merrimack valley , filled otherwise sunny skies with thick smoke and pushed thousands of residents out of their homes indefinitely
electrical power has been cut to the communities , and residents have been told not to enter their homes until each one has been inspected for potential dangers
columbia gas of massachusetts , which owns the gas lines involved in the blasts , has thus far given no indication of what might have caused the disaster
baker and other officials , including lawrence mayor dan rivera , issued scathing criticisms of the company
rivera said , with baker at his side at a news conference
he said that the company had promised hundreds of teams of technicians but that none have materialized.
bryant said the company had nearly 300 technicians in the field who had turned off gas to more than 3,200 of the affected customers , a necessary step before electricity can be restored
he said gas would be shut off to all homes in the area by saturday or sunday , allowing power to be turned back on and people to move back in
he referred questions about the cause of the incident to the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) , which is leading the investigation
we are sorry and deeply concerned about the inconvenience , he said
dazed and nervous people stood in the streets or milled around shelters as state and federal officials and columbia gas technicians methodically inspected buildings in andover , north andover and lawrence , just north of boston
before the explosions on thursday , columbia gas notified customers that it would be upgrading natural gas lines in neighborhoods across the state.
the utility said the move would bring increased reliability and enhanced safety features.
leonel rondon , 18 , of lawrence , was killed when an explosion at a house toppled a chimney onto the car in which he was sitting
his father , miguel rondon , stood outside his rowhouse friday watching a family friend who had volunteered to talk with reporters about his son as other relatives gathered on the steps
miguel rondon said the last time he saw his son was thursday , when he showed up after taking his driving test
he was happy , happy , miguel rondon said.
he made his license.
hector rondon , a relative of leonel rondon , handed a single sheet of paper to waiting reporters , with a short description , carefully prepared in english , of the young man the family had just lost
excited about life , it read.
loving and respectful.
and below , in tidy green script he liked cars.
hector rondon took the piece of paper back , folded it in half and then in half again and turned away , briefly raising his hands to his red , watering eyes
bryant , the columbia gas president , said the company extended deepest condolences to rondons family
but officials sounded increasingly frustrated and furious as the day wore on
rivera said he thought columbia gas was hiding from the problem.
baker said at the news conference with rivera
with his emergency declaration , baker said he was instructing the department of public utilities to authorize eversource , another private energy company , to take management control over the effort to restore utility services
baker , rivera and the states two u.s. senators , democrats elizabeth warren and edward j. markey , toured springfield street on friday
rep. seth moulton ( d ) , who represents the area in congress , also visited the neighborhood
bryant said the company has a tremendous track record and responded as quickly as possible
in the streets , people forced from their homes walked in small groups of three or four , carrying backpacks , pulling roller bags and towing wagons overflowing with possessions stuffed in plastic bags social security cards , birth certificates , medications
neighbors remained anxious about leaving their homes unattended
standing mostly outside to obey evacuation orders , members of one extended family guarded their homes and their block
justina lebron and her family spent one night in a hotel and plan to move in with her mother
they have milk and ham and other groceries in their wagon , and for now , they arent concerned about leaving an empty house
thursday night , the helicopters overhead worried lebron
i thought it was a crime , she said
but since then , there has been a parade of patrol cars through the neighborhood
what worries the family more is what comes next
what is the next step
thats what we dont know.
officials and experts cautioned that the cause of the blasts was still unknown , but they were focusing on over-pressurization as the most likely explanation
according to phmsa statistics , between 1998 and 2017 there were 745 serious incidents involving natural gas pipelines , resulting in 278 deaths and 1,153 injuries
in massachusetts in that same period , there were 15 serious incidents resulting in eight deaths and 31 injuries
before thursday , there had been none since 2012
michael ahern , director of power systems engineering at worcester polytechnic institute , said that once gas is extracted from the earth , it is carried first in large pipes that act as a sort of interstate highway system for gas transmission
gas at high pressure , generally about 1,000 pounds per square inch ( psi ) , is carried long distances in steel pipes with a diameter of 18 to 36 inches , ahern said
in the case of massachusetts , those lines will arrive from gas sources in texas , pennsylvania or canada , he said
those large transmission lines then arrive at regional gate stations , where pressure is reduced to an average of 10 to 50 psi , and then distributed locally in pipes that are usually about 8 to 12 inches in diameter , ahern said
those smaller pipes can be cast iron or steel if they are older , while newer pipes are plastic , he said
ahern said gas has been safely delivered this way for more than a century
while he was unaware of the specifics of thursdays explosions and fires in massachusetts , he said he suspected there was a unique set of circumstances that caused it , without reason to worry about the overall safety of gas delivery generally
he said instances of systems failing because of over-pressurization are rare
the most recent he could recall was in san bruno , calif. , in 2010 , when eight people were killed when a large gas transmission line exploded
over-pressurizing gas lines can result in too much gas being forced into homes , creating a situation in which a pilot light or any other source of flame can ignite it and cause an explosion and fire
two cases of gas leaks in residences led to deaths in the washington region within the past 20 years
in 1998 , gas collecting in the basement of a new loudoun county home ignited when a pilot light sparked , killing a 40-year-old mother of two , critically injuring her husband and launching their two children out the front windows of their second-floor bedroom
in 2016 , natural gas built up in the basement of a silver spring apartment complex and exploded , killing seven people and injuring more than 30
standing outside her still-smoldering springfield street home in lawrence on friday , jenny caceres , 36 , said that on thursday night she was trying to scramble eggs for her two daughters but her stove burners sputtered and wouldnt stay lit
she called her landlord , who went to the basement and found signs of trouble
a gas alarm was going off , but the meter wasnt running
he immediately banged on caceress door and told her to get out of the second-floor apartment
she stood across the street with her daughters , with only the clothes they were wearing
her 12-year-old didnt have shoes on
said caceres , a spanish-language translator for the lawrence school district
the building caught fire after she escaped
she doesnt know the condition of the apartment or the two birds she was pet-sitting for her grandmother
i have no idea , she said through tears
