parisian leaders are trying to tackle a problem that is evident to anyone who has ever tried to catch a glimpse of a historic site in a historic city and instead caught a foul-smelling whiff of stale urine
meet the uritrottoir , a portmanteau of the french words for urinal and sidewalk.
it is a bright red , free-standing dry urinal thats meant to give people well , some people a place to go other than a cobblestone street or scenic bridge
the uritrottoirs are filled with straw , allegedly odorless , and use the nitrogen and other compounds in urine to produce an organic compost
on the other hand , flowers grow out of the top
ariel weil , mayor of the 4th district of paris , has called it une invention de gnie ( an invention of genius ) that could solve a problem that persists in cities such as paris , at least until it rains
if we dont do anything , then men are just going to pee in the streets , weil told reuters news agency
but residents of the upscale and historic neighborhoods that are dotted with the red urine bins say they feel there has to be a better , less unseemly way
theres no need to put something so immodest and ugly in such a historic spot , paola pellizzari , who owns a nearby art dealership , told reuters
many have chafed at the design , which does n't include any type of enclosure to prevent the rest of paris from seeing someone relieve himself
responding to critics , weil insisted that paris had to do something
some dont like the public urinals , but they are better than nothing , he said
the paris city council will review the pilot program in september
if it is really bothering people , weil insisted , we will find another location.
the problem of public urination , of course , is not limited to france
since the early precursors of toilets were put into use 5,000 years ago , people have been trying to persuade their less-civilized brethren to refrain from going to the bathroom out in public
the advent of cities made things worse , in a way , forcing myriad passersby to experience what happens when a buildings exterior wall becomes an impromptu urinal
in india , a man painted images of gods on his wall to stop people from going , the bbc reported
and in the state of rajasthan , a group of volunteers has attempted to shame public pee-ers by playing drums and blowing whistles
the germans even have a whimsical-sounding word for the act , wildpinkeln or wild peeing.
a team in munich is working on a way to stop drunken fans from urinating along the lengthy walk between the citys soccer stadium and the nearby subway station
according to citylab , the solution involves a long , unplanted strip of flower bed , which would go over a giant tank , topped with bark chips to reduce the odor
and somewhat diabolical locals in hamburgs st. pauli quarter have started coating walls in a splash creating , urine retardant paint commonly used on ship hulls that basically coats the wildpinkeler in his own urine , the newspaper wrote in 2015
the germans also have a word for this
