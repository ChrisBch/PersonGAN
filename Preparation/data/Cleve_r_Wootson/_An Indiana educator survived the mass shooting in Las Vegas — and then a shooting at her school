for eight months , shelly alexander has found herself on the verge of going to pieces whenever she hears loud noises and for good reason
paddock used a bump-stock attachment that made his semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as rapidly as an automatic weapon nine percussive bangs every second
by the end , authorities estimated , he had fired nearly 1,100 bullets
alexanders taxi was caught in the hail of bullets
none of them hit her , but she did not leave las vegas unscathed
she goes to counseling regularly to deal with the trauma she experienced
and shes constantly having a mental dialogue with herself whenever she hears fireworks or doors slamming or a car backfiring
she was wrong
a 13-year-old student had excused himself from a class nearby and returned with two guns
the boy opened fire , shooting a 13-year-old classmate and a teacher and putting alexander in a small , unsought fraternity of innocent people who have survived two gun attacks
i cant do this again why a congressman walked out of moment of silence for texas victims
a seventh-grade science teacher , jason seaman , sprinted toward the student and disarmed him
seaman was shot three times but survived
about that time , someone made an announcement over the schools pa system
this was not a drill , it said
an active shooter was in the building
alexander , meanwhile , was winning the battle against her fight-or-flight response
at her hotel
but with a roomful of middle school students to protect that morning in may , the situation was different
she was also more prepared the school had put her and other teachers through active-shooter training
she and her students sheltered in a locked classroom , according to fox news
later , she escorted them to safety
inside , she was trying to manage flashbacks of las vegas and to quell the strong emotions that came with them
now as her school and her community recover from the shooting , shes contending with the bittersweet fact that she has companions on her road to recovery
for me , in vegas , i felt very alone , she told the herald.
i felt like what i was experiencing was very odd and crazy
it was like my new normal
i couldnt get used to it
and i didnt have anybody that fully had compassion for it because they didnt experience it with me
but with this at noblesville were all going through it together
