the tumor had ballooned to 132 pounds and stretched the patient 's abdomen into a 3-foot-wide orb
by the time oncologist vaagn andikyan examined the 38-year-old woman , she could no longer walk
and because the tumor was increasing the pressure on her digestive tract , she was malnourished and growing weaker everyday
it was the largest ovarian mucinous tumor andikyan had ever encountered , benign only in the medical sense of the word
it did n't take the gynecologic oncologist long to recognize the growth for what it really was a death sentence
science hinted that cancer patients could take less of a $ 148,000-a-year drug
its maker tripled the price of a pill
andikyan and danbury hospital in connecticut , where the surgery was performed , did not release the patient 's name or other identifying information at her request
complicating things for the woman the tumor was growing
the bigger it got , the faster it grew
and by february , it was adding about 10 pounds of mass a week
there have been larger ovarian mucinous tumors , including a 303-pound mass that left a woman bedridden before it was resected in 1994 , but the doctors at danbury had only read about a handful of such extreme cases in medical journals
every day , their patient 's risk grew along with her tumor
so doctors scheduled the surgery for feb. 14 about two weeks after the initial consultation and raced to plan a complex procedure in time to save the patient
exhaustive pre-surgery planning was necessary because there were many unknowns and hurdles to address , the hospital said in a statement
the scans could only tell the team of specialists so much , and there were myriad problems that could crop up once the patient was opened up in the specially-formatted surgical room
in two weeks , andikyan 's team had developed plans for five life-threatening scenarios
on surgery day , 25 different medical professionals were ready to proceed with what they believed was the optimal plan
to minimize the number of surgeries and reduce complications , doctors planned to cut out the tumor , then immediately perform an abdominal reconstruction , removing extra skin stretched by the mass and giving the patient a normal-looking midsection
overseeing it all , andikyan worried about the patient 's blood circulation
the tumor rested on a major artery that pumped blood to the legs
the hospital placed a cardiothoracic surgeon on standby in case things soured
one complication cropped up early the patient 's blood pressure dropped , and had to be stabilized
after that , the biggest task lay ahead of them removing 132 pounds of a viscous tumor
andikyan told the post that the tumor originated in the epithelial cells lining the woman 's ovary
it 's called mucinous because the tumor cells produce a gelatinlike substance
most such tumors are benign , but pathologists rushed to biopsy the cells and verified that it was n't cancerous
it was n't
and doctors had more good news they were able to save the woman 's uterus and one of her ovaries
she told doctors that she wants to have another child , and with her uterus intact , she 'll be able to do so
in fact , andikyan said her outlook is excellent the tumor was not malignant , all of it is gone , and there is not a large chance that it will come back
after five hours , one of the biggest surgeries of andikyan 's career was a success
and he could see the once-fearful woman who was wheeled into an examination room getting stronger every day
