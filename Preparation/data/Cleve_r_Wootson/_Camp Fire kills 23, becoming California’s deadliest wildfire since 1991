thousand oaks , calif
although the fire had been 25 percent contained by sunday , high temperatures and gusty winds made the weather optimal for the northern california fire to spread for at least another day
as of saturday , the camp fire had destroyed nearly 7,000 structures in and around the mountain town of paradise and has been blamed for most of the last weeks fire deaths
two people were also killed as a result of separate fires in southern california
but the bulk of firefighter resources were focused on the camp fire , the deadliest in the state since 1991
the 1933 griffith park wildfire in los angeles county killed 29
honea , who is also the county coroner , told the associated press that he had to add a fifth search-and-recovery team to help find bodies
authorities have not released the names of victims and have continued to search for more
his office has also ordered an additional dna lab truck and received help from anthropologists at california state university at chico for a time-consuming and daunting task in some cases , investigators have found only pieces of bone
the smoke , like orange fog , that enveloped chico and surrounding towns friday gave way to a low-lying haze that spread all the way up to redding during the weekend , moved by a shift in winds
as the fire moved on , displaced residents were allowed to return to whatever was left of their homes , in some cases finding only ash and charred foundations
jerry brown ( d ) requested a presidential major disaster declaration , which would make the hardest-hit communities eligible for housing , unemployment and other support programs and allow state and local governments to repair or replace fire-damaged facilities and infrastructure
fema has already granted a state request for emergency aid
president trump has alternated between offering sympathy for displaced people and firefighters and lashing out at californias leaders over what he deemed poor forest management
he tweeted sunday morning , echoing a criticism that he has frequently leveled at california officials and threatening to withhold federal money
there is no reason for these massive , deadly and costly forest fires in california except that forest management is so poor
billions of dollars are given each year , with so many lives lost , all because of gross mismanagement of the forests
remedy now , or no more fed payments
officials shot back that increasingly destructive fires are a result of global warming , which dries out vegetation and turns large swaths of grassland into a tinderbox
a spokesman for brown said that more federal forest land has burned than state land , adding that the state has expanded its forestry budget while the trump administration has cut its budget for forest services
as the argument intensified , state firefighters found their resources divided between a historic fire in the north and a pair of fires in the south
near los angeles , about 200,000 people were displaced by the expanding woolsey fire , which began midafternoon thursday near simi valley , even as fire departments were responding to a second wildfire , the hill fire , just west of thousand oaks
the flames raced from the conejo valley to the pacific ocean , across highway 101 and the santa monica mountains , at speeds that shocked veteran fire officials
authorities said two bodies were found , both burned , in malibu in a vehicle that had been in the path of the wildfire , though homicide investigators had not officially declared a cause of death
fire crews , including many from out of state , were deployed throughout areas projected to be in the path of furious santa ana winds
but fire officials working in steep terrain thats hard to reach say they are short of crews and equipment , with many resources deployed in northern california to fight the camp fire
in oak park , a community 40 miles from los angeles , richard gwynn , 75 , and his wife , lynda gwynn , 70 , surveyed the burned landscape of what used to be their home
she became emotional , looking at a canyon where her children had once played , now blackened by fire
richard gwynn said.
but theres nothing left to burn.
fire officials warned that the winds would be back sunday morning , and they were right
the santa ana winds surged down from the high country just as local and state officials held their 9:30 a.m. news conference
the officials pounded home a warning to residents dont go back into the mandatory evacuation zones
its not safe
the destructive wildfires are nowhere near extinguished and remain exceedingly dangerous
as they spoke , a massive plume of smoke appeared to the south , toward malibu , where dozens of homes had been lost in the woolsey fire
los angeles county fire chief daryl osby said
he said the footprint of the woolsey fire contains many unburned areas that are vulnerable to embers stoked by gusts that could reach 40 mph
the fierce winds , which may last for three days , could make drops from firefighting air tankers less effective
with the woolsey fire only 10 percent contained , it could roll south along the pacific coast , from malibu to topanga canyon and on to pacific palisades , to the doorstep of santa monica
the only thing were not concerned about is the ocean , osby said
