the discovery of five pipe bombs mailed to prominent democrats , cnn and a liberal billionaire put the country on edge wednesday and sent law enforcement officials scrambling to prevent any more packages from reaching their targets
the hunt for a serial mail bomber began late tuesday night when secret service personnel conducting standard mail screenings found a pipe bomb inside a plain manila envelope with a bubble-wrapped interior addressed to former secretary of state hillary clinton
a similarly packaged bomb was found hours later in mail addressed to former president barack obama
as more devices were discovered , a disturbing pattern emerged the bomber or bombers appeared to be targeting prominent figures on the political left
the first such package was discovered monday at the new york home of george soros , a billionaire activist known to fund pro-democracy and liberal political groups
amid a poisonous political campaign , gop leaders rush to condemn explosives
officials described the devices as attempted acts of terrorism and cautioned that the number of bombs and intended victims could grow
fbi director christopher a. wray issued an appeal for the publics help to catch the bomber and warned people not to touch suspicious packages
officials said the packages used as a return address the office of wasserman schultz , who chaired the democratic national committee during part of the 2016 campaign
one such package used an incorrect address for former attorney general eric h. holder jr. , and it was returned to her office in sunrise , fla. , where it was intercepted , according to officials
authorities do not believe she had anything to do with the packages and think she was a potential victim
a spokesman for holder declined to comment
the pipe bomb addressed to brennan was found in the mail at cnns headquarters in new york
since leaving the government , brennan has been an outspoken critic of president trump he is an on-air analyst for nbc news and msnbc , rather than cnn

to the other five
the packages came with computer-printed address labels , six forever stamps and return addresses with wasserman schultzs name misspelled , officials said
law enforcement officials described the devices as pipes stuffed with explosive material and wrapped in electrical wire and tape , but they provided no detail on how they would have been detonated
the fbi , the secret service , the nypd and other agencies kicked into high gear wednesday morning trying to determine who was behind the bombs and how many more may be en route to intended victims
at least two of the devices appeared to have been hand-delivered , according to law enforcement officials
said c. bryan paarmann , an fbi counterterrorism official
the devices have been sent to the fbis lab in quantico , va. , for further analysis
most mail-bombing suspects are loner types , said brady , who added he doubts this bomber made a mistake when he used a bad address for holder
wasserman schultz issued a defiant statement
amid the frenetic pace of the investigation , some alarms turned out to be false
a suspicious package sent to new york gov
andrew m. cuomo ( d ) was in fact a thumb drive , according to the nypd
authorities also searched an office building in san diego that houses a newspaper before concluding there was nothing dangerous there
the known recipients of the bombs are all frequent targets of conservative politicians , including trump
speaking at the white house , the president decried the bombs and pledged that the federal government would bring those responsible to justice
those words did not satisfy cnn president jeff zucker , who issued a statement sharply critical of the administrations posture toward the news media
when anthrax-laced letters terrorized washington and new york
politicians of both parties condemned the mail bombs
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ) called them attempted acts of domestic terrorism.
new york mayor bill de blasio ( d ) used similar language
de blasio said
as news of the homemade bombs spread , authorities vowed to ramp up security measures
the nypd increased patrols in areas linked to public figures and at media offices
the senate sergeant at arms sent a message to senators and their staffers advising them to be cautious when handling mail and reminding people not to bring unopened mail or packages from outside into their senate offices
they have also increased security measures for steyer , the biggest donor to super pacs supporting liberal causes and candidates this election cycle
top republicans , including trump and mcconnell , have sought for weeks now to cast the rising tide of public anger as actual acts of violence and a phenomenon to be laid at the feet of democrats
mcconnell said in an associated press interview this month
the contentious confirmation of supreme court justice brett m. kavanaugh prompted fierce and occasionally personal protests targeting republicans on capitol hill
gop leaders chided democratic leaders , including clinton and holder , for delivering remarks that they claimed encourage incivility and potential acts of violence
anxiety , painful memories after bomb found in cnn building
but law enforcement has made arrests in recent incidents targeting members of both parties
a new york man was arrested in august for threatening two house republican leaders another new york man was arrested last week for threatening gop senators over kavanaughs nomination
in april , a california man pleaded guilty to threatening to kill waters
and a florida man was arrested this month for posting threats on facebook against democrats and republicans who opposed kavanaugh
earlier this month , a far-right group called the proud boys attacked left-wing protesters outside an oct. 12 republican party event in manhattan
new york police have since arrested several members of the group
the devices sent to clinton , obama and soros this week were all pipe bombs placed inside plain manila brown envelopes with the addresses typed on stickers , according to a law enforcement official
the official said those three devices appeared to be capable of exploding and causing injuries
authorities urge anyone who receives a suspicious package to contact law enforcement , the official said
the devices were sent out just months after a 23-year-old in the austin suburbs set off a string of package explosives in that region , killing two people and wounding several others
that bomber delivered some in person and sent others through the fedex system , which enabled authorities to track him down
unlike the packages intercepted before reaching obama and clinton , the device sent to cnn was found while its building was teeming with employees
cnns offices at the time warner center in new york evacuated suddenly wednesday morning after the suspicious package was discovered there
the network broadcast footage of its staffers and others from the building flooding the manhattan streets below , where anchor jim sciutto could be seen on a cellphone calling in on the air
zucker wrote in a letter to employees that the center was evacuated out of an abundance of caution after the package was found in the mailroom
he also told employees that cnn had checked on its other bureaus but found no other devices
chi li , 28 , who works at a technology company near cnns building , left to run an errand and came back to find the area closed off
the instant , inevitable cries of false flag after bomb threats targeting the clintons , obamas and cnn
as investigators continued to explore the devices and their origins , white house officials and others in washington decried the string of packages
vice president pence posted a similar statement , calling the devices despicable and saying that anyone responsible will be brought to justice.
trump chimed in after , writing i agree wholeheartedly
i agree wholeheartedly
a letter was sent to trump jr. 's home earlier this year that resulted in his wife going to the hospital
a man later pleaded guilty to sending threatening letters with white powder to trumps sons and other public figures
