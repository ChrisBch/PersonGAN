a month later , the former obama white house staffer has a different concern that his widely shared movinginwhileblack experience will be a largely meaningless blip in history
trying to turn their bad moments into a national call for action , martin and several other black people whove had police sicced on them while theyve been doing innocuous things a meme-able phenomenon hashtagged livingwhileblack are asking for a congressional hearing on the issue
on monday , they sent a letter to the leaders of the house and senate judiciary committees , asking for a hearing on racial profiling before the august recess
the signers shared the letter with the washington post before sending it to congress
the other unexpectedly viral stars whove signed the letter have their own horror stories lolade siyonbola , the yale graduate student who was nappingwhileblack when a fellow student dialed 911 , and donisha pendergast , the bob marley granddaughter of airbnbingwhileblack fame
you know why the lady called the police black people face 911 calls for innocuous acts
the request for a congressional hearing is an attempt to use their sudden celebrity to combat a culture they say too often looks at the actions of black people with criminal-tinted glasses
martin said the notion of a congressional hearing was obvious , given his political background
then he reached out to siyonbola , pendergast and others , hoping their collective voices would spur legislative action
policymakers in the past have held hearings to address racial profiling by police , but martin said legislators should do something to combat unnecessary and outrageous calls by the people who summon officers in the first place
martin said hes not promoting a specific policy position or piece of legislation , but rather would like to hear what a collection of experts , victims and legislators has to say about potential solutions to the issue
he told the washington post.
why dont we formalize that
traveling while black why some americans are afraid to explore their own country
the do something , of course , is the hard part
calling the police on people who are doing nothing except being black is an affront to an innocent persons dignity and , martin argued , a possible threat to their safety
but should it also be a crime
in the letter , martin says the issue of the assumed criminality of black people is something that has haunted black people in america since black people have been in america
still , he told the post that he realizes that his moment of fame is as fleeting as the livingwhileblack hashtag , and he wants to seize the moment
