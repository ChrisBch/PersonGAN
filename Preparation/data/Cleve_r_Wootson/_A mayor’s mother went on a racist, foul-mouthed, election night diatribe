the race was still too close to call early wednesday , but it looked like james rotundo , the mayor of palisades park , n.j. , would end up on the losing end of a democratic primary battle against council member chris chung
the apologies and explanations from james rotundos camp came quickly
still , minorities in a borough with one of the nations densest populations of ethnic koreans worried the outburst was a public display of private antipathy toward a group that has flocked to palisades park in the past 40 years
in a facebook post , rotundo , who has been mayor for 14 years , said his mother sincerely regrets her words and the woman had apologized and retracted her statements
yesterday my 80 year old mother , who i love dearly , put up a very inappropriate facebook message that she sincerely

the democratic primary race between him and chung , who is korean american , remains undecided chung has a thin lead , though about 100 provisional ballots are expected to be counted by monday , according to the newspaper website
with no republican candidate running , the democratic primary is essentially the race for mayor
while the ballots are being authenticated , rotundo has been on a de facto apology tour for his mother
i have never heard my mom talk like this before , he said in the facebook post.
i believe her when she says she is mortified and did not mean these hurtful things
i want to make it clear to everyone that i do not agree with these remarks and that i am very upset and saddened by this incident.
rotundos campaign manager said the candidates 80-year-old mother is not well
apologies aside , lorraine rotundos posting quickly spread through the areas korean american community , who saw it as another not-so-micro aggression by a white person aimed squarely at the korean americans who now outnumber them
sarah kim , with the korean american association of new jersey , told new york abc-affiliate wabc.
i am an american , as well.
people who identify as asian account for more than 57 percent of the population of palisades park , according to the census bureau
in 1980 , the boroughs asian population was 6 percent , according to the new york times
there have been growing pains
in 1994 , the borough cracked down on businesses that had signs posted only in korean , requiring them to put up signs in english with the same font size , the times reported
but what koreans saw as the biggest affront came in 1996 , when the city passed an ordinance that critics say disproportionately affected late-night korean restaurants and karaoke bars
some korean americans have a personal stake in next weeks summit finding family
the ordinance required karaoke bars , which are almost entirely korean-owned , shut their doors at 9 p.m. and restaurants to close their doors at 3 a.m. , according to the times
it was a bid , the ordinance said , to maintain the boroughs tranquil residential character.
many of the towns korean immigrants work late hours and enjoyed being able to unwind with korean food at 4 a.m
the rules would cut the hours and profit margins of the immigrant-owned businesses
the most egregious thing , detractors said , was the new rules excluded premises commonly known as diners , meaning the boroughs only 24-hour diner owned by a white person could continue to stay open around the clock , the times said
swibinski , rotundos campaign manager , said reports of racial disharmony were overblown and the immigrant influx had a positive impact on the town
it helped revitalize palisade parks downtown and gave the borough a thriving koreatown
he said lorraine rotundos facebook post was a product of an unwell woman , not a sign of something bigger
palisades park , new jersey , the only zip code in america with a majority korean population , is about to get its first korean american mayor
