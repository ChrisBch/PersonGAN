just 30 or so people attended the 1992 protest on the steps of georgias state capitol a smattering of student activists but mostly reporters and a few georgia bureau of investigation agents , snapping photos of demonstrators lighting a state flag on fire
in tuesdays gubernatorial debate , abrams said she was proud of georgia and proud to be a georgian , but deeply disturbed by what the confederate symbol stood for
she called the protest an action of peaceful protest that reflected the views of many
i said that that was wrong , she added about the confederate symbol
and 10 years later , my opponent , georgia secretary of state brian kemp , actually voted to remove that symbol
goldie taylor , editor at large at the daily beast who said she co-led the march , tweeted tuesday that abrams did not burn the flag , an act taylor attributed to two other students
kemp , a republican , did not speak on the flag issue during the debate , and his campaign did not return messages seeking comment
he has tried to portray abrams as too extreme for georgia
in ads and speeches since abrams won the democratic primary in may , kemp has been calling her an out-of-touch liberal
house candidates campaign on their agendas , but voters vote on trump
when abrams was in college , more than half the georgia state flag was made up of the confederate emblem , which squeezed the georgia state seal into a small rectangle on the left
the confederate emblem was added in 1956 as a rebuke of the growing civil rights movement , the associated press reported
previous flags had featured the state seal and blue and white bars
political pressure to change the state flag began to mount again as the state sought to host the 1996 olympics and concerns rose that a blatant symbol of the confederacy was harming the states business reputation , according to the ap
in 2001 , the state put the confederate emblem in a much less prominent position on the flag , part of a smaller display of previous state flags beneath the phrase georgias history
the latest iteration of the georgia state flag , from 2003 , erases the stainless banner
abrams has made no secret of her disdain for the confederate images and symbols that dot her state , and the picture of her during the protest has become part of a growing debate about the role of those symbols in places of public veneration
georgia has one of the largest commemorations , a gigantic bas-relief carving on the side of stone mountain that features confederate leaders gens
stonewall jackson and robert e. lee and president jefferson davis
in 2017 , shortly after violence in charlottesville during a white nationalist march , abrams said the monument on stone mountain should be removed
paid for by founders of the 2nd kkk , the monument had no purpose other than celebration of racism , terror & division when carved in 1915 , she wrote on twitter
we must never celebrate those who defended slavery and tried to destroy the union
confederate monuments belong in museums where we can study and reflect on that terrible history , not in places of honor across our state
on the campaign trail , kemp has said he would protect the monument from the radical left
the differences of opinion about the flag were reflected on social media , where some said they would never vote for someone who had desecrated a flag , while others lauded abrams for doing her part to get rid of a symbol of racism
way to go staceyabrams
leadership without action is cowardice and you 're actions were on the right side of history
burn baby burn all the confederate symbols you
when staceyabrams was at spelmancollege , the georgia state flag still had the confederate emblem in its design
she exercised her first amendment rights by helping to burn it on the state capitol steps
good for her
id have set that thing on fire , too
georgia democratic gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams helped torch state flag during college protest dont burn our
good for her , one person wrote of abrams
id have set that thing on fire too
