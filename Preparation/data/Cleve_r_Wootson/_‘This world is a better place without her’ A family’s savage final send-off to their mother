the obituary is short and decidedly unsweet , a grand total of 105 words spread over five increasingly savage paragraphs
it starts with the birth of kathleen dehmlow ( nee schunk ) in the winter of 1938 and her marriage to dennis dehmlow 19 years later , all in the tiny minnesota city of wabasso
two children came from that marriage gina and jay
but the death notice quickly fast-forwards to 1962 , apparently a pivotal year in the soap opera of kathleen dehmlows life and her childrens
by the fifth paragraph , it is clear what her children feel about their mother and her chances in the hereafter
paragraph 1 okparagraph 2 okparagraph 3 waitparagraph 4 ohparagraph 5 *airplane flies overhead with a banner reading welcome to hell mom*
gina and jay could not be immediately reached for comment
its unclear what motivated them to write the scathing obituary or to publish it in the redwood falls gazette , the paper of record of dehmlows hometown , a 0.8-square-mile patch of minnesota with fewer than 700 people
if the five-paragraph obituary provides a window into kathleen dehmlows life , it is a jaded and incomplete one
its not unheard of for aggrieved family members to use the last words written about a person to get the last word , said susan soper , an expert on obituaries and the creator of a workbook that helps people write their own
others have used obituaries to shed light on the damaging addictions that consumed their loved ones
the motivations of family members can be as simple as they are powerful catharsis , bitterness , anger
people dont generally speak ill of the dead , soper told the washington post.
in fact , sometimes they will put the best possible face on a person in the obituary and overlook whatever the misdeeds or characteristics that might be unpleasant
the hysterical obituary that made strangers miss a man they never knew
for example , marianne theresa johnson-reddicks daughter outlined many of her mothers sins in a 2013 death notice
perhaps even more scathing than the words in the newspaper was the essay katherine reddick wrote in xo jane , explaining why she wrote it
on weekend nights , she would go out on the town , drugging the younger children so they wouldnt cause trouble and forcing the older ones to subsist on dog food
reddick , said the obituary expressed authentic and heartfelt reflections about a woman who never resembled a mother
the family of leslie ray popeye charping , of galveston , tex. , was similarly elated at his passing last year and maintained no enduring concerns about speaking ill of the dead
according to cnn , they posted a scathing obituary on the carnes funeral home website , shortly before cremating charping and unceremoniously placing his ashes in a barn
obituary confessions are , of course , not always so morbid
for example , in 2012 , val patterson , a scientist from salt lake city admitted in his mostly lighthearted obituary that he didnt have a doctorate in engineering and that he hadnt even graduated from college
even stood for
for all of the electronic engineers i have worked with , im sorry , but you have to admit my designs always worked very well , and were well engineered , and i always made you laugh at work.
