stacey abrams refused to utter the l-word
as the associated press called the georgia governors race for georgia secretary of state brian kemp on sunday , cnns jake tapper was asking his opponent whether she felt the victor was the legitimate governor-elect
abrams , who had hoped to force a runoff with kemp but conceded the race on friday , pivoted to her concerns about irregularities , voter suppression and a last-minute investigation during her campaign for her states highest office
during the race , she had accused kemp of actions antithetical to democracy making it harder and in some cases impossible for certain groups of georgians to vote
so , with abrams admitting kemp was the winner , tapper pressed during her first national interview since the election
he wanted to know whether she thought kemp had a legitimate claim on the office , even as other democrats publicly stated that the race had been stolen
but we know sometimes the law does not do what it should , and something being legal does not make it right
abrams continued , using another l-word.
but what you are looking for me to say is there was no compromise of our democracy and there should be some political compromise in the language that i use , and thats not right
whats not right is saying that something was done properly when it was not
will i say that his election was not tainted , was not a disinvestment and a disenfranchisement of thousands of voters
i will not say that
abrams , who hoped to become the nations first female african american governor , has accused kemp of widespread voter suppression and said voting irregularities tainted the election
the accusations had special sting because kemp , as secretary of state , was essentially the referee in a race he was involved in
on friday , kemp had 50.22 percent of the tally , an edge of nearly 55,000 votes

she also said she planned to seek elected office again
as the washington posts vanessa williams and felicia sonmez reported , kemp and abrams have clashed over voting rights in georgia for years
kemp has pushed for restrictive voter identification and registration laws that have purged more than 1 million voters from the rolls in recent years
several of those laws were successfully challenged in court , which said they were violations of the federal voting rights act
more recently , abrams and other democrats accused kemp of championing a law that disproportionately affected black voters and launching an 11th-hour investigation of the democratic party , which he accused of trying to hack the states voter registration system
