john oliver is not the first person to blast the trump administration for using scripture to justify its practice of separating children from parents accused of entering the united states illegally
but he may be the first to make the point using whimsical childhood rhymes
on sundays episode of last week tonight , oliver pointed out that the bible is not a government document , regardless of u.s. attorney general jeff sessionss use of the holy book to defend the administration on the family-separation issue
oliver dedicated nearly five minutes of his show to explaining why the bible passage romans 13 cant be used to shield the administration from the torrent of criticism about what many religious and political leaders say is a harsh and immoral crackdown on undocumented immigrants
white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders , who is a conservative christian , echoed sessionss thoughts when asked about them by the white house press corps
but olivers criticism was about more than the nations chief lawyer using a religious document to justify a government action
a growing chorus of faith leaders the rev
franklin graham , son of billy graham rabbi jonah dov pesner of the religious action center cardinal daniel dinardo , president of the u.s. conference of catholic bishops has said that the administrations practice of separating children from their parents is immoral
trump tweets regret for picking jeff sessions , but advisers say hes unlikely to fire him
olivers biggest argument was not about the separation of church and state or the historical minefield that surrounds romans 13
it was about hypocrisy
his finishing point was that president trumps administration is on shaky ground if it wants to use the bibles moral code as the standard for all its actions
