one moment , shizuka matsuki was out for a walk with her pit bulls , standing next to a pond at silver lakes rotary nature park in davie , fla. , roughly 30 miles north of miami
the next moment , she was gone
the only sign that the 47-year-old woman had ever been there friday morning were the dogs , now alone and barking near the water , refusing to leave
one sported a fresh , bloody wound
a witness who ultimately called authorities walked toward the dogs and spotted a large alligator in the water , according to miami abc-affiliate wplg
and only one car was in a nearby parking lot registered to matsuki and her husband
still , the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission warned people not to jump to conclusions about what had happened on the side of the pond until they could investigate
by late friday , they revealed the grisly news
we would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of shizuka matsuki
search teams located the body of ms. matsuki june 8 at the silver lakes rotary nature park lake in davie
we will be conducting a thorough investigation into this incident
that evidence was a human arm , the florida sun-sentinel reported , citing authorities
they were able to confirm it was matsukis appendage because of a distinctive tattoo
authorities located her body a short time later , the fwc announced on twitter
neighbors at the gated isla del sol community in plantation , where matsuki lived , told the miami herald she was a soccer mom whom they frequently saw walking her dogs in the morning while wearing workout gear
her husband was away in chicago on friday , neighbor peter limia told the herald , but had warned matsuki to be careful or to possibly avoid walks alone at the nature park altogether
limia said , relaying what he had heard from other neighbors
but people in matsukis neighborhood had received other warnings about another body of water where she frequently walked her dogs
on wednesday , one of her neighbors snapped a picture of an alligator lounging on a front porch , the herald reported
police were called , and the gator was removed
according to the florida sun-sentinel , the isla del sol homeowners association sent an email to its residents shortly after the six-foot gator was trapped
its unclear if matsuki ever received or read that message , or if it had encouraged her to put her dogs in the car and take them for a walk at a spot farther from home
she was a frequent visitor to silver lakes rotary nature park , but authorities have not said why she opted to go there friday morning
nate fischer , a neighbor of matsukis , wrote on facebook that matsuki would frequently let her dogs off their leashes , allowing them to swim in the water
he saw them occasionally when he was fishing in the neighborhood
the warning from the neighborhood association about alligators in the water may have prompted her to change things up and go to a lake farther away
florida wildlife officials have logged 401 unprovoked bite incidents from 1948 to 2017 , according to a fact sheet published in 2017
at least 24 of those incidents resulted in fatalities , according to the report
before matsukis death , the most recent fatality was in june 2016 , when a nebraska boy whose family was visiting the walt disney world resort was snatched by an alligator and pulled into a lake at the grand floridian resort & spa
