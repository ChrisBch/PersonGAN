the act of kindness seemed destined to pull johnny bobbitt from the depths of homelessness and drug abuse he was struggling with on the day kate mcclures car sputtered to a stop in front of him
she was a motorist on interstate 95 in philadelphia who found herself stuck on an off-ramp , scared and out of gas
he was a homeless veteran who told her to lock her doors , then spent his last $ 20 to bring her a canister of fuel
later she sought to repay the favor , first with cereal bars and warm socks and spare dollars , then with a gofundme campaign to raise money so the good samaritan would not have to sleep under a bridge
bobbitt , she told anyone who would listen , deserved a fresh start
he is such a great guy , and talking to him each time i see him makes me want to help him more and more
they hoped the gofundme would raise $ 10,000 , but the story resonated
it was featured in national newspapers , including the washington post
the pair made an appearance on good morning america and were interviewed by the bbc a feel-good story at the start of the holiday season
in a few months , the campaign had raised more than $ 400,000 from nearly 14,000 donors , and bobbitts prospects had brightened
but over the past 10 months , the sweet story has soured
there are accusations of mismanagement and outright theft of the money raised on bobbitts behalf
the gofundme cash , bobbitt suspected , had been squandered on vacations , a luxury car and more than one addiction
and this weekend , the threat of litigation loomed
last fall , mcclure said , the plan was to get bobbitt a house and his dream truck , a 1999 ford ranger
bobbitt also planned to donate money to people and organizations that had helped him as he struggled with homelessness
the plan was to make the second act of bobbitts life a successful one , and for a while , things seemed happy

in reality , things werent that rosy
instead of a house , mcclure and damico got bobbitt a camper , which they kept in their names and parked on land owned by damicos family , according to news reports
they bought him a television , a laptop and two cellphones , food and clothing and a used suv that was soon broken-down and idle
what he didnt get , though , was any type of ownership over the money raised on his behalf
he met briefly with a financial adviser , but there was never any lawyer or any trust , according to richmond cbs affiliate wtvr
but bobbitt said he saw troubling signs for the money that thousands had donated to him
mcclure is a receptionist for the new jersey department of transportation and damico is a carpenter , according to the philadelphia inquirer
but suddenly she had a new bmw , and the couple was taking vacations to florida and california and las vegas , bobbitt told the inquirer
he learned of a helicopter ride they took over the grand canyon
and he told the inquirer that damico has gambled away some of the gofundme money
( damico told the newspaper he had used $ 500 from the account to gamble on a night when he forgot his sugarhouse casino card but had quickly repaid the money with his winnings )
good intentions had given way to something else , bobbitt told the philadelphia inquirer
with that amount of money , i think it became greed , bobbitt said
according to the inquirer , damico spoke of expenses he and his girlfriend had incurred caring for bobbitt , including time they took off from work
and damico gave an evolving account of how he handled the money to the inquirer
initially , he said he would not produce financial records because the money was put into an existing account at pnc bank that does not belong to bobbitt
on wednesday , he said he and mcclure had opened up a separate account for bobbitt
on thursday morning he said he told a reporter the trusts had been set up because thats what bobbitt wanted him to say
the money that came to bobbitt couldnt stop his addiction
he went through two unsuccessful stints in rehab that brought him no closer to being sober
some of the money gofundme donors gave to him ended up in the pockets of drug dealers , bobbitt told the inquirer
in april , six months after his fateful meeting with mcclure , bobbitt told the inquirer that he had been clean for three weeks and jobless for much longer
its going to be a struggle for the rest of my life , he said of his addiction
damico , who frequently gave bobbitt a ride to counseling sessions and group meetings , told the inquirer that giving a six-figure sum to a man addicted to opioids is like me handing him a loaded gun
he has to do what he has to do to get his life together

on saturday , it was unclear how much of the money earmarked to bobbitt had actually gone to him
damico told the inquirer he had made some lump-sum payments to bobbitt , but damico and mcclure did not return calls or messages to the post seeking comment
they also didnt provide financial statements or records in interviews with other news organizations
chris fallon , an attorney hired by bobbitt , told the post on saturday that they are attempting to secure an accounting before a scheduled meeting on monday and didnt want to speak for fear of jeopardizing arbitration efforts
gofundme told the associated press it has launched an investigation to determine whether the money was mismanaged and is working to ensure bobbitt receives the help he deserves and that the donors intentions are honored
if bobbitts claims are true , it would be the biggest case of gofundme fraud or mismanagement seen by gofraudme , a whistleblower organization , according to adrienne gonzalez , the sites publisher
some of the hucksters are serial scammers who start dozens or hundreds of bogus campaigns in a day , said gonzalez
others fake diseases , figuring no one will demand evidence of , say , a recent cancer diagnosis
and still others , she said , end up unwitting fraudsters unqualified to handle the vast sums of money they suddenly find themselves stewards of
from the bat , its clear that there was no sort of plan , gonzalez said of bobbitts case
she didnt plan on it exploding , but once it started to explode , she didnt think about how this man was actually going to get help
people contributed not thinking that this is a sick individual who needs help and no amount of money is going to make that go away overnight
savvy donors should look for a plan that ensures the money will make it to a needy person , and some type of accountability measures to ensure donations dont end up in the wrong pockets , she said
nearly a year after bobbitt and mcclure met , the camper is gone , and so is the suv
bobbitt told the inquirer that he remains an addict and still doesnt have access to the money that was supposed to turn his life around
at night , he sleeps under a bridge at the intersection of callowhill and second streets , near an i-95 on-ramp
he spends his days doing exactly what he was doing when mcclures car stopped in front of him panhandling
