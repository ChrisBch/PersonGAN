the warning to parents came sunday , a few hours after the appointed time for trick-or-treating in galion , ohio a 5-year-old boy had tested positive for methamphetamine after collecting candy on the citys west side , officers said
candy may have been laced with the drug , police said , and parents should scour their childrens sweets
nearly a week later , authorities were trying to scuttle any fears about a candy-drugging stranger
meanwhile , cambray carwell , the father of braylen carwell , the boy in question , was charged with possession of methamphetamine and evidence tampering , police announced on the facebook page they had used to warn the community
police say carwell , 24 , also tested positive for meth a week after a hospital analysis found evidence of the drug in his sons system
the 5-year-old told cbs affiliate wbns , describing what his parents said was a seizure.
and then i couldnt move my arm or my fingers
fda approves powerful opioid despite fears of more overdose deaths
the boys mother told wbns that she and braylens father are recovering drug addicts but that both have been clean for years
she denied her son could have come into contact with methamphetamine through a family member
after braylen was released from the hospital sunday , police obtained a search warrant for carwells house
inside they found drug paraphernalia , marijuana and methamphetamine
they also tested the boys candy and toy teeth that his parents said he had put into his mouth
those tests came back negative
carwells story is eerily similar to one of the earliest claims that halloween candy had been laced with drugs , contributing to an urban legend that still lingers in the minds of many parents
in 1970 , 5-year-old kevin tostons family said he died after snacking on tainted halloween candy while at his uncles house in detroit
authorities later determined that the child had gotten into his uncles poorly hidden stash of heroin , eaten it and died
but the story stuck in peoples minds and was even used in an attempt to cover up a murder
on oct. 31 , 1974 , ronald clark obryan laced his 8-year-olds pixy stix with cyanide
the boy complained of searing stomach pain , then died on his way to the hospital , the post reported
obryans motive , texas investigators learned , was to collect $ 20,000 in life insurance money
he also distributed the poisoned candy to his daughter and other neighborhood children
he was executed in 1984 , but not before other condemned prisoners bestowed upon him the nickname candy man a villainous sobriquet that has endured for decades
