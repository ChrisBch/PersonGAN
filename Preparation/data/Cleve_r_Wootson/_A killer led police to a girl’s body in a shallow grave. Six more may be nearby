to investigators , arthur ream was always tight-lipped about any connection he had to the disappearance of a half-dozen girls who went missing outside detroit in the 1970s and 1980s
but to other inmates , authorities say , ream was a prison cell braggart who spoke frequently about the girls he killed and the shallow graves he buried them in mysteries that have flummoxed investigators for nearly four decades
investigators whove pieced together strings from some of those other inmates have reopened the cold cases of six young girls
this week , theyve been using earth-moving equipment to find the remains of the girls in macomb township , roughly 20 miles northeast of detroit
warren police commissioner william j. dwyer said at a news conference wednesday.
we are cautiously optimistic that we unfortunately will find remains.
officially , the police are searching the woods for the body of 12-year-old kimberly king , who was reported missing in september 1979 while staying at her grandparents home
the cold case was reopened in october , and this week , aerial images and photographs showed a crew digging at the edge of a rural wooded field on the property of a vacant farm in macomb township
ream is familiar with the area
that is where ream buried the body of cindy zarzycki , a 13-year-old girl he killed in 1986
zarzycki was dating reams son at the time
the older man abducted her from a dairy queen in eastpointe after gaining her trust by saying he was planning a surprise party for her boyfriend , according to the macomb daily
a girl was found dead in a landfill 49 years ago
she has finally been identified
two decades later , he led authorities to her remains in a wooded area southwest of 23 mile road
he is serving life in prison for her murder
in addition to king , authorities have identified four other potential victims , according to detroit nbc affiliate wdiv
dwyer said wednesday that the victims had no connections to one another
any foul play appears to be a crime of opportunity
reams attorney in the zarzycki murder case , tim kohler , told the detroit free press that he saw no hint that the man he was defending has killed other victims
before the murder trial , according to the newspaper , kohler told ream he might be able to strike a deal with prosecutors a plea agreement for second-degree murder if ream told him where cindys body was
but ream , whom kohler described as not a likable guy , told his attorney , i cant do that.
at some point , he changed his mind
he ultimately led authorities to zarzyckis body and drew a map of the scene
a decade later , at the same place , dwyer said investigators are cautiously optimistic that we unfortunately will find remains.
dwyers department and an fbi search team more than 25 people in total spent most of this week using earth-moving equipment to dig for bodies
by wednesday afternoon , their grid search hadnt turned up anything
but dwyer said they wanted to make sure they did a thorough search and were willing to work 24 hours a day if necessary
