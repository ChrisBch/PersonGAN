myesha senior planned to accept her psychology degree with a dash of flair
her familys roots are in jamaica , so she was going to flash a usain bolt pose , then strut across the stage at the university of floridas graduation ceremony
her mom was a giddy accomplice , ready to hoist the jamaican flag and scream when she saw her daughters face on the arenas giant screen
one graduate did a back flip on the stage
another proposed to his girlfriend
many others snapped stage selfies
but seniors moment quickly soured
mid-pose , an inappropriately aggressive marshal at the ceremony grabbed her and pushed offstage as thousands watched and others recorded
videos of her and other similarly treated black students spent the weekend ricocheting around twitter
many saw more than an over-the-top marshal and a botched attempt to maintain decorum
just over 6 percent of the student population at the university of florida identify as black or african american , according to forbes
but 100 percent of the students being bodily removed in the worst videos were black , including senior
i was getting ready to do the usain bolt pose , she told the washington post
i tried to do it really fast
i saw the guy coming toward me and when he pushed me , i almost fell , and i caught myself
but he pushed me so far that i passed the ladys hand that i was supposed to shake
it happened several times to several people on friday
nafeesah attah , who planned to flash a delta sigma theta sorority hand sign , was pushed so hard her cap fell off as she struggled to maintain balance
oliver telusma spent a few seconds in a sort of rotating bear-hug with the unidentified university official
a short time later , university of florida president w. kent fuchs found himself apologizing , saying school officials were inappropriately aggressive in rushing students off the stage
during one of this weekends commencement ceremonies , we were inappropriately aggressive in rushing students across the stage
i personally apologize , and am reaching out to the students involved
attah and senior said they received personal calls from fuchs , who apologized and said the university was taking steps to make sure the actions didnt happen again
the marshal responsible for the action is being investigated , he told them
fuchs didnt return a message from the post seeking comment , although he made a public apology at the next days commencement exercises
i was just reading a book canadian cops called on black man reading c.s
lewis in his car
it was unclear what , if any , disciplinary actions were being taken and what specific steps the university was taking to ensure it didnt happen again
in his apology fuchs did not say why the marshal had treated the students in that manner
statement by presidentfuchs at today 's commencement ceremony
the students who got the worst of it had mixed emotions about the university presidents response
senior said fuchs was gracious when he called her
but his apology didnt come after she was pushed , she noted , it came after the university was roasted on social media
and fuchs was sitting on the stage when senior and the others were hurried across it
he did nothing in the moment , she said
students who had been rushed off the stage insisted the damage was done
they had only one chance to walk across the stage as an undergraduate , and it will forever be a bad memory , they said
telusma told abc news he felt bad for his family , whose lasting memory , at least for undergrad , will be them watching their son having his back turned toward the audience and being handled like a savage animal
as ufs very involved commencement website can attest to , institutions of higher learning have to stage-manage large , quasi-public events full of unpredictable people who dont always follow the rules of decorum
cellphones go off
so do clothes
then there is this potty-mouthed graduation fight that happened to the soundtrack of pomp & circumstance
there is only so much that administrators can do to control or punish misbehaving students who are about to walk out of a university for the last time
attah told the post she understood the need for decorum
but she believes her actions were not undecorous or any more extreme than the actions of some white classmates who were not manhandled
a lot of people think that its very trivial , attah said
it speaks to the bigger and larger issue of race relations in the united states at this time and making sure that black students feel comfortable at these universities
this is the time to highlight black excellence instead we were treated like criminals at our very own commencement
for senior , the effects of the marshals actions endured long after the graduate hung up her cap and gown
that night , she went out with friends to celebrate one of their last times together before moving onto the next chapter in their lives
but the night was muted , senior said , because she spent a good chunk of it responding to people criticizing her on twitter
i was not being disrespectful , she said
i have home training
my family was there watching
i didnt push nobody
i didnt yell at nobody
i was very collected
now people are making it into this whole different argument
it is just the hidden racism
did you just call black students animals
at this point , you want to call me an animal and say were ruining a traditional ceremony , she said of the critics , some of whom were especially harsh
i just want to tell those people , you guys are the animals
im pretty sure if this was a white graduate that was manhandled , you would be like , oh no , fire the marshal , shut down uf
