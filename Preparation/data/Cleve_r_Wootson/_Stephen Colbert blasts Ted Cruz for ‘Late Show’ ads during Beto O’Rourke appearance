with a little over 50 days until texas voters cast ballots , incumbent sen. ted cruz ( r ) and his supporters are doing everything they can to quiet the buzz around suddenly surging democratic challenger rep. beto orourke
in recent days , the texas gop pulled out a photo of a punk-rocking orourke wearing what may very well be a dress , cruzs campaign released a potty-mouthed video of orourke spewing a certain four-letter word on the campaign trail
and a photo of orourkes dui arrest has been making the rounds , even though it is two decades old
and on wednesday , the senators campaign was apparently unwilling to let the democrat have airtime on a national late-night tv show without some ted cruz counterpoint
as the houston chronicle originally reported , the cruz campaign bought tv ad time on cbs during wednesdays airing of the late show with stephen colbert , which featured orourke
that meant viewers in amarillo , san antonio , waco and el paso who tuned in to see orourke also got to see cruzs face
the ad buy was not lost on colbert , who spent four minutes of airtime taunting cruz about it
most teeth ever
stephen colbert ponders what else trumps doctors might say
on the show , orourke touched on some of negative advertisements , including the punk rock pictures
four guys living in a plymouth satellite.
but he also touched on policy issues , telling colbert that he lived in a border city , el paso , that has a low crime rate , hometown evidence that president trumps arguments linking immigration to violent crime are flawed
we dont need a wall , he told colbert
he also said he wasnt daunted that trump would be joining forces with cruz to try to help the incumbent win the senate race
earlier , colbert had scathing words about that , too
