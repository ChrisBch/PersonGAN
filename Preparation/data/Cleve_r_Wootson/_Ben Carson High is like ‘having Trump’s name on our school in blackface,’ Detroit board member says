if anyone represented what a detroit high school student could become with the proper dedication and focus , it was ben carson or so the thinking went
he graduated from southwest high school in 1969 , two years after riots in detroit began to paint the motor city as an dreary symbol of urban decay
he went on to become a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon , operating on fetuses inside the womb and separating twins conjoined at the head
as detroit was crawling out of the largest municipal bankruptcy in u.s. history , carson was launching a bid for the nations highest office
he is a presidential medal of freedom awardee and the current u.s. secretary of housing and urban development
but its that last act carsons foray into politics and his association with president trump that has detroit school board members calling for someone to pry the letters off the high school that bears carsons name
detroit school board member lamar lemmons told the washington post , when asked why is he leading the charge to remove carsons name
and hes allied himself with a president that says he is a white nationalist and sends dog whistles that even the deaf can hear.
lemmons said the neurosurgeons name was plopped onto the school while the city was being overseen by an emergency financial manager following the 2013 bankruptcy , skirting the more ponderous process for determining whose name should grace a detroit school
it wasnt always this way for detroit or for lemmons
when carson came to speak at a detroit church nearly two decades ago , lemmons brought his granddaughter and took a photo of the surgeon holding the baby
for a time , lemmons said , it was a cherished family memory
and shortly before carson launched his ultimately unsuccessful bid for president in 2015 , he showed up at his namesake school and spoke to students , according to the detroit news , imparting a lesson on resilience
ben carsons hud political loyalty required , no experience necessary
but now , lemmons said , community members regularly send him letters asking the school board to rename dr. benjamin carson high school of science and medicine
and if carson makes a trip to detroit , there will be no laying of hands on the lemmons children
carson could not immediately be reached for comment
in the past , he has defended trumps treatment of minority issues
