on the surface , andrew macintosh was a shining pillar of the brisbane , australia , community
he served dutifully on the city council 's inclusive board , which made recommendations about how the city should grow
and he was a national quality manager for aveo , which owns retirement communities along the country 's coasts
but in an unflattering picture snapped on a public sidewalk in the greenslopes neighborhood , macintosh , 64 , was recently unmasked as something else
the predawn jogger who secretly defecated on neighborhood streets
he is seen staring at the camera in the incriminating photo , caught literally with his pants down , the reflective parts of his black running shoes glowing in the sudden camera flash
if he looks surprised , that 's because he was photographically ambushed by a neighbor who waited in the bushes to capture just this moment an amateur undercover sting operation that intensified for more than a year , according to australian news site news.com.au
over that time , neighbors say , the man they dubbed poo jogger had defiled their streets some 30 times
and it was not some sudden , primal urge while out for a morning run a call of nature that anyone with sudden gastrointestinal distress could empathize with
the poo jogger 's potty breaks reeked of premeditation
right next to his droppings , the poo jogger frequently left used toilet paper

vexed and apparently tech-savvy neighbors at one point set up a hidden camera with night vision capabilities to try to catch the pooper in the act , the news site reported
the camera did n't capture any definitive images , but the amateur sleuths had something to work with a rough approximation of what time of day the public defilement occurred
so resident steve smith decided to take matters , and a camera , into his own hands
he secreted himself in a piece of shrubbery in the early-morning hours , lying in wait for the poo jogger
it was a rare instance in which a man hiding in bushes taking photos of someone defecating became a neighborhood hero
smith told news.com.au.
theres a red light which goes on before the cameras flash goes off , and he saw that and looked at me as the photograph was taken
and with that , the poo jogger 's identity was no longer a secret
smith posted the photo on a neighborhood bulletin board , and the police were soon involved
macintosh was charged with being a public nuisance
in court this week , he was ordered to pay a $ 378 fine , according to the courier mail
and he was a few thousand retweets away from joining a pretty gross fraternity of public defecators
nsw won origin and yet , once again , queensland is the real winner , having caught the poo jogger
in may , for example , thomas tramaglini , the 42-year-old superintendent of kenilworth ( new jersey ) school district , was arrested after he was seen defecating on a high school football field , as the washington post 's jacob bogage reported
school staff and the resource officer were notified that someone was regularly befouling the track and football field , and authorities began surveilling the area
and residents of a colorado springs neighborhood have been infuriated by a woman they refer to as the mad pooper.
cathy budde , her children and their neighbors keep finding the brunette woman 's feces and the napkins she uses to clean herself along a community 's running paths , the post 's rachel chason reported
budde has snapped photos of the woman , and even confronted her in person , but she does n't know her name.
the mad pooper will face criminal charges if she is ever caught
in australia , things have quickly soured for macintosh
now that he has been outed , neighbors have started taking pictures of him even when he is not relieving himself
he is also the subject of viral social media vilification and no longer works at aveo
the company said in a statement obtained by the guardian
