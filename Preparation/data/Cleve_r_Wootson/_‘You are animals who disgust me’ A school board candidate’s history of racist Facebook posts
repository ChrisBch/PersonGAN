eight months later , ferguson was on his facebook page again , as he called for violence against protesters
jankowski is one of six candidates running for three open seats on the school board in monroe township , n.j
in the districts high school , more than a third of students identify as minorities , according to u.s. news & world report
it is not uncommon for news organizations to look closely at the backgrounds of people running for elective office
what is uncommon is for disparaging information to be laid out in a public social media post , easy for the world to see
lets give this rickjankowski the attention he seeksthisisamerica livingwhileblack
simpson , caitlyn jenner , trayvon martin , affirmative action supporters , nascar driver tony stewart , cher and whoever the hell moby is in addition to obama , james and the protesters in ferguson
his personal facebook page and the one for his campaign had both been deactivated or set to private by saturday morning , and jankowski did not respond to messages seeking comment
members of his community , meanwhile , were speaking out , either distancing themselves from jankowskis splenetic remarks or mobilizing to make sure he doesnt attain the office he seeks
education leaders in the community said jankowskis comments do not reflect the board he was campaigning to join
the closest hes come to the school board was being vocal at some meetings , board of education vice president james henderson told nj.com
a teen spread a racist video of a black classmate eating chicken
both face criminal charges
when loretta winters , the head of the gloucester naacp , heard about jankowskis comments , she mobilized an effort to ensure he never took a seat on the dais of the school board
she said that similar reports ran in a local newspaper this week and that the next morning she received a phone call from jankowski
he apologized profusely , she said
more important , he told her he was dropping out of the race
she said she accepted his apology but felt that he showed contrition only because he got exposed.
