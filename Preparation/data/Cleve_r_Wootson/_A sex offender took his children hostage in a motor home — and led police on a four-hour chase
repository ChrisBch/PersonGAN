if not for the criminal twist , it would have been a routine outing on an overcast day , stephen houk , 46 , piled his 3-year-old son , 11-month-old daughter and a dog into a tan rv and cruised some california highways
but trailing behind the bicycles attached to the back of the stolen rv were as many as 15 police cars , lights flashing
they would not let the large , tan recreational vehicle out of their sight but also were unable to safely bring it to a stop
houk is a registered sex offender
he is presumed to be armed and , as of wednesday , still on the loose
his children , whom he is accused of kidnapping , are safe , and were last photographed playing at a police precinct , moments away from being reunited with their mother
the rv-centric police chase houk stretched for more than 100 miles and riveted the golden state on tuesday
the gas tank of a late 1980s-model toyota dolphin motor home without an optional auxiliary tank holds 25 gallons of unleaded fuel , good for nearly 300 miles of highway driving
in houks case , it was good for one odyssey-like four-hour police chase through a large swath of southern california
she called police , and houk took the children and a dog and fled on foot until he apparently found the 25-foot dolphin rv
houk could not outrun the officers , but law enforcement also could not stop houk , who was wanted for child abduction , evading authorities , child endangerment and weapons violations
with such a big vehicle , reporters for nbc-affiliate kcra opined , spike strips or an attempt to stop the vehicle by force could end disastrously for the young hostages inside or innocent bystanders on slick roads
and there was another x-factor investigators believed the felon had a gun
if things got desperate , the children would be in even more danger
because of all that , a police spokesman told the international business times , officers were being as patient as possible with houk
while newscasters spouted all those factors in grave tones , houk looked rather nonplussed in videos that showed the inside of the rv
the dolphin has a boxy , tan exterior , with plush carpeting , oak-paneled cabinets , slimline blinds and a fluffy , velvety couch inside , according to a brochure that lists its specifications
it was the cheapest and smallest model of the dolphin motor homes of the time , which featured a vast array of things that fold into beds
houk accelerated it to normal freeway speeds but never topped 60 mph in moderate to light traffic
some newscasts showed him talking on the phone as the rv ambled along , with a dog seated in the passenger seat
it had plenty of time to get comfortable
according to los angeles abc-affiliate kabc , the vehicle chase started around 2:30 p.m. and stretched for four hours around the greater los angeles area
the suspect fled on surface streets at normal speeds in the midcity wilshire area of los angeles , driving toward hollywood
a short time later , the rv entered the 101 freeway and then got onto the 170 freeway , headed north to the san fernando valley
houk then switched over to the northbound 5 freeway , traveling through santa clarita , castaic and newhall
by then the chase was nearing the four-hour mark
it was unclear whether houk was headed anywhere in particular
as he left one jurisdiction and entered another , some officers would fall back and others would take up the chase
the only limiting factor seemed to be the dolphins gas tank
houk eventually switched to the 99 freeway going north , went through bakersfield on surface streets , then got back on the same highway headed south
but the chase at least this part of it was headed to an end
according to the sheriffs office , the motor home came to a stop around 6 p.m. at a road in shafter , just north of bakersfield
police surrounded the rv and appeared to be trying to negotiate with someone
but houk wasnt inside
when officers looked inside the rv , the two children were there , and so was the dog , but there was no sign of houk
the children were taken away by police , and officers began trying to reconnect them with their mother
a short time later , authorities made the announcement the children were safe , but the manhunt would continue
both children have been found safe & uninjured
manhunt for suspect underway ... armed parolee at large pursued by law enforcement from hollywood to bakersfield ... lasd
