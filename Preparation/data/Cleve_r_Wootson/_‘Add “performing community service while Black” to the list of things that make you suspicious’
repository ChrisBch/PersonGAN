the absurdity of the situation was so overwhelming that , for a moment , shawna harrell had to walk away from the state trooper in front of her
here she was , garbage bag in hand on a highway shoulder elbows deep in bottles and needles and diapers discarded by other people trying to explain to a man with a badge why she was not a suspicious character
the historically black sigma gamma rho sororitys harrisburg , pa. , chapter had adopted a section of interstate 83 near the susquehanna river
and on saturday , harrell and other sisters grabbed bags , gloves and blue and gold t-shirts and went out to do some service for their community
after a quick selfie in front of the adopt-a-highway sign stenciled with the sororitys name , they had filled several bags
volunteering while black cop allegedly accused sorority girls of 'fighting while they were doing community service
then they saw the state trooper , lights flashing , pull up behind one of their parked cars
whats going on
the trooper asked , according to a recounting of the incident posted by harrell and shared on social media.
are yall fighting
the officer said he had received reports of black women fighting on the side of the highway , harrell said
no , sir , harrell told him.
we are cleaning the highway.
to emphasize their point , the women held up their garbage bags and pointed to the highway sign that had been the centerpiece of their selfie moments ago not to mention the sorority insignia on their shirts
it was not enough
the trooper said he had never seen people cleaning this particular section of highway and wanted to see id
and just like that , harrell said , they were the latest people to have their innocuous activity viewed through criminal-tinted glasses all because they happen to be black
share your story have you been racially profiled on a college campus
the trend has been repeated across the nation
a black kindergartner was handcuffed by police for throwing a temper tantrum
police have been sicced on black people buying clothes at fancy stores , and the less-fancy outlets where those stores ship out-of-season clothes
one man believes someone thought he was a dangerous negro while watching waves and quietly reflecting on a book about being a better christian
last week , a yale university student had the cops called on her because she was taking a nap
add performing community service while black to the list of things that make you suspicious
this happened to my sgrho sorors in harrisburg , pa this morning
though they were n't harmed ( thank god )
the fact that the officer asked for their ids is telling
in her post , harrell said she had filed a formal complaint
sigma gamma rho sorority had gotten word of the incident and demanded an apology
the statement said
sigma gamma rho sorority releases statement on sorority members being questioned by state trooper while engaged in an adopt-a-highway community service activity
he said the trooper asked the women for identification so that he could document who he spoke with
drivers routinely call police when they see people on the side of the highway , tarkowski said
the agency did not provide details about the interaction between the trooper and the sorority members on the side of the road
its unclear if there was a police report , and the agency did not identify the trooper involved
it was also unclear if the police agency intended to issue an apology
the agency did however , comment on the volunteers saturday morning service
