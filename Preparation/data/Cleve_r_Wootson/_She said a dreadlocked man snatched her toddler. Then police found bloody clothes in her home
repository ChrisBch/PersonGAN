still smarting from a fresh head wound saturday night , charisse stinson described a parent 's nightmare
she had been walking down the street with her 2-year-old son , jordan belliveau , when a toyota camry pulled up , she told investigators
the driver said his name was antwan , and he asked if she and her son needed a ride
in the car , stinson said , she was suddenly hit in the head and blacked out
when she came to in a nearby park , antwan , his toyota camry and her toddler were gone
police in largo , fla. , a town nearly 20 miles northwest of st. petersburg , began a statewide search for the boy
they said he was possibly in the company of a man known only as antwan a roughly 25-year-old black man with dreadlocks and gold teeth who was wearing black and1 basketball shorts and a white tank top
investigators released a sketch of the suspect
they searched ponds and dumpsters and woods
at a news conference , they spoke directly to antwan , asking him to drop off the child at any safe place
and they told the public , as one investigator vowed , we 're going to find jordan.
but behind the scenes they had doubts , according to the tampa bay times
records from social workers showed concerns about how stinson , 21 , was caring for the boy who had been returned to his mother just a few days before he disappeared
the boy 's father had doubts about the veracity of stinson 's story
and at stinson 's home , investigators found toddler clothes covered in blood
late tuesday , they charged stinson with felony child abuse and murder
she told investigators that jordan had an unexplained , serious injury to his right leg , according to an arrest affidavit
he had seizures throughout that night , the police documents said , and his condition worsened
instead of taking her dying son to a hospital , police told reporters in a news conference , stinson took him to a secluded wooded area and hid his body
after disposing of her son , stinson gave herself a head wound , then walked across the street to a hampton inn , a made-up story in tow
investigators found jordan 's body tuesday , although they declined to say how
his wounds were consistent with what stinson had described
in an interview with reporters , largo police lt. randall chaney said detectives were suspicious of stinson 's story from the beginning but were not going to discount reports of a missing child without doing everything they could to investigate his mother 's claims
chaney said that during stinson 's statement , she never showed remorse
there was no feeling of any remorse , only her attempt to escape the reality of the story by making things up as she went
that included antwan , who chaney said investigators now know stinson made up
and with that , antwan joined a long list of imaginary black boogeymen invented to deflect attention away from heinous crimes
perhaps the most famous case is that of susan smith , a south carolina woman who , in 1994 , claimed a black man hijacked her car with her children in it
later , she admitted that she had driven into a lake with her children inside
in 1989 , charles stuart of boston claimed that a black man jumped into the car as he was driving his pregnant wife home from lamaze class , and shot her to death
after their baby boy , delivered prematurely , also died , the boston police and media zeroed in on a succession of suspects , eventually singling out willie bennett
charles stuart committed suicide after his brother matthew revealed to police that it had all been a lie , and that carol stuart was killed for insurance money
boston was left to grapple with how eagerly it believed a black man was to blame
in 2009 , bonnie sweeten claimed that she and her 9-year-old had been kidnapped by two black men in a truck , according to cbs news
in reality , she had taken her daughter to disney world
sweeten had swindled loved ones and the law firm she worked at out of nearly $ 600,000 , and was trying to avoid getting caught
and in 2016 , a police officer in jackson , ga. , said she was the victim of an unprovoked attack by a mentally disturbed 250-pound black man
a short time later , officers said she had lied about the attack and shot herself in her bullet-resistant vest to sell the story
sherry hall 's story of a crazed black man cavalier enough to attack a police officer spread fear in her city of 5,000 fear that hall stoked during television interviews
