as soon as jessica griffin 's daughter 's feet hit the floor wednesday morning , she collapsed in a heap
five-year-old kailyn kept trying to stand but fell every time
she was also struggling to speak , her mother said
her daughter had been fine when the family went out to a t-ball game the night before , nbc-affiliate wlbt in jackson , miss. , reported
maybe kailyn was having a hard time waking up wednesday morning , or perhaps her legs were asleep
then griffin saw the tick
she had gathered kailyn 's hair to put it in a ponytail when she spotted the arachnid , embedded in the girl 's scalp , swelled with the girl 's blood

she pulled the tick out and placed it in a plastic bag , then rushed to the hospital with kailyn , wtxl reported
doctors told griffin it was an uncommon condition called tick paralysis
griffin , of grenada , miss. , wrote in a facebook post wednesday that seemed a mixture of worry and relief.
scary is a understatement
griffin could not be immediately reached for comment
it was unclear where or when she thought her daughter had acquired the tick , or how long it had been on her body
ticks are most active from april through september , the washington post has reported
tick paralysis is caused by female ticks on the verge of laying eggs
after the tick eats a blood meal and is engorged , it secretes a neurotoxin into the host , according to the american lyme disease foundation
the symptoms can occur five to seven days after the tick starts feeding
paralysis begins in the legs , then spreads to the upper extremities
it can manifest as fatigue , numbness and an increasing inability to move , according to the foundation
in the later stages , it is harder for the victim to move her face or tongue
if nothing is done , the toxin ultimately makes it impossible for a person to breathe , resulting in respiratory failure
the paralysis is more common in animals , which are unable to check themselves for the ticks
but human children also are susceptible because of their smaller body mass
girls get tick paralysis more frequently because the ticks can easily hide in long hair , according to the foundation
the cdc reported a cluster of cases of the extremely rare disease in 2006
one of the victims was a 6-year-old girl who had trouble walking a week after visiting her grandmother in the mountains of larimer county
a nurse bathing her after she was admitted to the hospital found a tick along her hairline
and last year , amanda lewis woke up and found that her 3-year-old daughter , evelyn , could n't stand no matter how hard she tried , according to the la grande observer
lewis , of la grande , ore. , posted a video on facebook , hoping family members or friends could help figure out what was causing the girl 's sudden strange ailment
they could n't , but the video was watched about 22 million times and shared more than 600,000 times
at the hospital that day , physician john page saw that a 3-year-old had been admitted with ataxia and suspected that it might be tick paralysis
he scoured the girl 's scalp and found the arachnid , which was embedded in the skin and could have been easily dismissed as a red bump
once it was removed , evelyn was walking the next day
in mississippi last week , kailyn griffin had a similarly quick recovery
her mom 's last picture of the incident showed the girl grasping two balloons in a hospital hallway
griffin wrote , including a raised hands emoji.

an earlier version of this post incorrectly identified ticks as insects
they are arachnids
