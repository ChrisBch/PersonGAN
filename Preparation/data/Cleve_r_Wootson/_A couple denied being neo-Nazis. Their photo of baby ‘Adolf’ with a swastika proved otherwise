claudia patatas and adam thomas had long denied being leading members of the white-power group national action , which is banned in britain
but their family photos suggested otherwise
there is the one of patatas holding their newborn while thomas holds a flag emblazoned with the nazi swastika
and theres one of thomas cradling the baby boy the child is wearing polka-dot footie pajamas , his father the sort of hooded robe favored by ku klux klansmen
there is also the middle name that the couple chose to give to their son adolf
at the end of a seven-week trial in birmingham crown court , thomas and patatas were convicted of terrorism charges after leading not-so-secret double lives
both were found guilty monday of being members of national action , the extreme right-wing organization that virtually deifies adolf hitler and the third reich
thomas was also found guilty of possessing instructions to make a bomb
the group hoped to start a race war that would rid britain or at least the county of west midlands , halfway between london and liverpool of anyone who didnt happen to be white , according to police
when national action was banned , after popular anti-brexit campaigner jo cox was killed by a far-right extremist , the group re-branded , calling itself the triplekmafia , a not-too-subtle allusion to the ku klux klan
but authorities said the groups members werent simply a bunch of photo-snapping nazi-philes with white-power insignia decorating their homes
we now know they were a dangerous , well-structured organization , midland police detective chief superintendent matt ward said in the police statement.
their aim was to spread neo-nazi ideology by provoking a race war in the uk and they had spent years acquiring the skills to carry this out
underscoring the threat , police announced the conviction of two other members of national action mikko vehvilainen and alex deakin
thomas had tried twice to join the military but was rejected both times
patatas and thomas had also tried to swell the ranks of national action , putting up offensive stickers at aston university in birmingham
national action was the first extreme right-wing group to be banned in britain after cox was killed in summer 2016
during the trial , according to the washington posts karla adam , witnesses told jurors that white supremacist thomas mair shouted britain first
then shot cox three times and stabbed her 15 times
authorities said mair was an avid reader of far-right literature
in his home , police found books about white supremacy and nazi germany
coxs husband called her death a political act and an act of terrorism.
mair was sentenced to life in prison , and authorities added national action to a list of more than 80 terrorist organizations banned in the united kingdom
but the ban didnt stop patatas , thomas and other adherents in midlands
the couples continuing fascination with nazism , white supremacy and racial war was on display at their trial
the bbc said the couple was part of a secret relaunch of the group a different name , triplekmafia , but the same agenda
the couple kept an ax and a machete at home , and authorities found a crossbow near the newborns crib , the news organization said
but they also had several items best described as nazi memorabilia a mug with an ss emblem and a cookie cutter shaped like a swastika
two couch cushions also bore swastikas , and a festive holiday sideboard in their living room had kkk figures and the words may all your christmases be white.
