it was supposed to be a sedate sunday afternoon on the edisto river a group of friends kayaking along the south carolina waterway that has been dubbed a paddlers paradise.
then one member of the group paddled under a tree
suddenly , members of the group initially told authorities , a rattlesnake dropped from the tree and plopped into the kayak with the 28-year-old man , michael adams
the snake bit the man on the hand twice , colleton county fire chief barry mcroy told the columbia ( s.c. ) state
but this story was met with skepticism by an expert on snakes
and on tuesday a man claiming to be the victims cousin offered a different account of what happened
kyle colquitt told abc news 4 that his cousin was the victim , and that he had picked up the snake from the water
colquitt added that his cousin remained calm while another kayaker paddled to a nearby house for help
the washington post could not independently confirm this account
after the man was bitten , the kayakers dialed 911 at about 5:20 p.m. an ambulance rushed the man to a nearby hospital , where the emergency room had antivenin waiting
a silver spring woman was recently bitten by a venomous snake in her bed
during the ambulance ride , mcroy said , the man was in bad shape , and greatly deteriorated.
parts of his body swelled up , the chief said , and he had trouble breathing
the man spent the night in the colleton medical center intensive care unit , charleston cbs affiliate wcsc reported
the next day , he was flown by helicopter to a better-equipped facility , where he remained in critical condition
the snake was captured by the injured mans friends , but authorities have not said what type of rattlesnake it is
because of access to high-quality medical care
between 7,000 and 8,000 people are bitten by snakes each year , according to the university , and about five to six americans die of the bites each year
when presented with the kayakers initial account , david a. steen , a research ecologist with the georgia sea turtle center , told the washington post that the story sounded peculiar
snakebites are reportedly on the rise in maryland
steen said that he did not know enough about the south carolina incident to say what happened , but that people who get bitten by rattlesnakes often do so after trying to handle the reptiles
