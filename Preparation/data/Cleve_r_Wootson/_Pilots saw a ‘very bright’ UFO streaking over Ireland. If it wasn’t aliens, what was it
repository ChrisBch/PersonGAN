the confused person on the radio was not someone typically associated with dodgy reports of extraterrestrial interaction
there were no claims that large-eyed green men crossed the cosmos to turn livestock inside out or too-detailed , breathless tales about cold metal tables and undignified alien probes
the flummoxed person on the radio was simply an airline pilot who could not explain what she saw in the sky over ireland
the british airways pilot was operating flight ba94 from montreal on friday when she contacted the nearest air traffic control tower to inquire whether there were any military exercises over the atlantic ocean to which she hadnt been alerted , according to the irish examiner
when controllers told her that the skies were clear , she politely set them straight
she said she and her crew saw bright lights streaking through the air at phenomenal speeds twice the speed of sound
also wondering were pilots flying nearby , who saw the same , well , whatever it was
the irish aviation authority said the reports will be investigated under the normal confidential occurrence investigation process.
but for many people who read between the classified lines , there was no need
we already know the truth
this is normally the point at which chortling naysayers would shout their disbelief
after all , for decades the public has been told that aliens dont actually exist and that people who believed otherwise were crackpots in tinfoil hats
sorry , this strange space rock was not sent by aliens to save us
but in an admission straight out of a b movie , the pentagon recently confirmed that there was a $ 22 million government program to collect and analyze anomalous aerospace threats government speak for ufos
and area 51 , the secret base in nevada whose existence had been denied by the government for decades has existed for decades , the government admitted
it was a test strip for a cia spy plane and other classified aircraft , according to a cia history declassified in 2013
and because the government had a giant secret test base in the nevada desert , it used the area for all kinds of secret testing putting the a-12 aircraft and the angular f-117 stealth ground attack jet through their paces
so who needs a tinfoil hat now
the admission lent a patina of viability to a century of bizarre , unexplained phenomena
but what of the bright lights over the atlantic seen by not one but two airline crews responsible for the health and well-being of hundreds of passengers
aircraft experts told the irish examiner that the lights were probably meteorites entering earth at a low angle
the high speeds were the result of acceleration caused by earths gravity
the bright lights were probably the result of friction as the celestial bodies pierced earths atmosphere
we believe you
