the bottle of orange juice cost $ 5 at shoprite , but tayeb souamis wife had found the same brand on sale for $ 2.50 elsewhere
yes , it was only 250 pennies , but every one of them mattered to a family that had just refinanced its home and had a daughter headed to college
so on may 19 , souami dutifully trudged back to the store in hackensack , n.j. oj and receipt in hand
but at the customer service counter , he saw a sign for the powerball jackpot , which had ballooned to $ 306 million at that point , according to video of souamis news conference posted by cbs new york
he liked the number and was feeling lucky , so he purchased two tickets using the money he got from the returned orange juice and mostly forgot about the lottery for the rest of the day
thousands of south carolinians won the lottery on christmas or so they thought
now some are suing
the next morning , it was more errands
souami , 55 , had some work to do in the yard , but he also wanted to get his car washed while his wife stayed at their home in little ferry , preparing meals for the week
but on the way to the carwash , he stepped into a 7-eleven convenience store to check the tickets
i scanned the first ticket
it wasnt a winner
and the second ticket it was good , but always i see $ 2 , $ 4 , but that day i see , must be seen by the retailer
i scan it again and it said the same thing
and i say to the lady , i hand it to the lady and i say can you check
i think your machine is not working
souami said the clerk scanned the ticket and said , oh , my god
souami , a father of two who immigrated from an undisclosed country in africa in 1996 , had purchased the sole winning ticket
the winning numbers were 3 , 6 , 9 , 17 , 56 and the powerball 25 , according to newjersey.com
his odds of winning were one in 292.2 million
he described himself as an occasional lottery player , more likely to play when the prize reaches a high amount
after learning he was a winner , he spent the next three weeks planning the rest of his life
he says he bought two mega millions tickets in his life
the second won him $ 533 million
souami , who until very recently was an accountant for a food importing company , said he wanted to make sure the 200 people he works with would be okay before he quit
the father of two decided to take the $ 183 million cash payout and remain in his new jersey home town
hell pay off his recently refinanced home , pay for his daughters college tuition and pay off his own college loans
and perhaps hell toast with his new favorite drink
i love orange juice now , he said
