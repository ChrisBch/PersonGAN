music- and booze-filled party cruises around lake victoria are a rite of passage of sorts for fun-seeking young ugandans , but the one that pushed off into the waters saturday night seemed doomed from the start
the rickety vessel was in poor condition and had been docked for some time before people started piling into it near kampala , the ugandan capital , authorities told the associated press
the owners of the boat did not have a license to operate and overloaded the boat well past the point of being safe
making things worse , rough weather had turned the water in africas largest lake treacherous
the revelers aboard including a ugandan recording artist and a prince were apparently unaware of the danger until it was too late
the trouble began about midway through the cruise , not far from shore
about 7 p.m. , the boat overturned and sank , spilling about 90 people into the lake although some estimates have as many as 120 crammed into the vessel
inebriated partygoers suddenly found themselves flailing in the water , facing a life-or-death scenario
many were not wearing life jackets , authorities said , and their panic was probably increased by their state of intoxication
witnesses said they heard people screaming for help , treading water or trying to swim to shore
sam tukei , one of several men who used fishermen canoes to try to rescue people , told the ap.
by the time the police came , we had saved many people.
two fishing boats that came to the aid of passengers were overwhelmed with people and capsized , according to the bbc
government rescue teams arrived a little later , sending divers into lake victoria to recover at least 33 bodies over the next two days , according to reuters
on monday , the third day of the recovery mission , police and government teams were trying to pull the wreckage of the boat out of the lake to determine whether more bodies were beneath it , according to police
to pull bodies out of the water , uganda-based nbs tv reported , officials were using fishing nets
video sabitijoseph the number of the exact people who were on the boat are contested , the eye witnesses say they were about 120 but the police says they were about 90
in an attempt to retrieve the missing bodies people are throwing fishing nets
dozens of family members and friends spent a chunk of the weekend gathered along the shoreline , peering through a wire fence , emitting occasional screams or cries at the sight of a loved ones body being pulled from the water , the bbc reported
others pored over sweaters , wallets , keys and shoes , hoping to identify the dead
among the rescued were music artist iryn namubiru , according to the bbc , and prince daudi kintu wasajja , brother of the king of buganda , ugandas largest traditional kingdom
the boat was owned by a man named templa bissase or bissaso and his wife , according to a statement that president yoweri museveni issued to the ugandan daily monitor on sunday
the boat was traveling from a private beach and had the capacity to carry 50 people but it was unregistered , unlicensed and possibly uninsured
the boat partys music was turned up so loud , musevenis statement said , that the people aboard might not have heard the emergency commands of the captain.
shamirah nsereko , a survivor , told ntv uganda on sunday night that the captain repeatedly warned the passengers that the boat was taking on water and listing
they might not have heard him over the music
but then youre talking to people who are so drunk , she said
boat accidents are increasingly common on east africas large lakes , including lake victoria , which is surrounded by uganda , tanzania and kenya and is larger than switzerland
saturdays tragedy was the second large-scale sinking on lake victoria in two months
in september , nearly 150 people died after a ferry carrying hundreds of people capsized on the tanzanian side of the lake , the bbc reported
the ferrys capacity was 100 people , but 400 had climbed aboard , many of them carrying goods for nearby markets
a lobster boat captain said a freak storm killed his crew
then doctors found drugs in his system
critics directed their rage at the government , which they accused of using an overloaded , undersized ferry on a busy route that crosses lake victoria a half-dozen times a day
compounding problems it was market day , and the ferry was also loaded with supplies , including heavy bags of cement and corn
editha josephat magesa , a resident who lost an aunt , father and younger brother in the september boat tragedy , told the bbc
but closer to uganda , as authorities continued to pull bodies out of the water , it was unclear who , if anyone , would be held responsible for the weekend deaths
the husband and wife who owned the boat were listed among the victims
museveni said in his statement
