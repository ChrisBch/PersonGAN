the albertsons manager interrupted the conversation between guadelupe zamorano and hermelinda stevenson to chastise them for the rule they were publicly flouting , right in front of the grocery store
they were speaking spanish
supervisors verbally harassed hispanic employees , the complaint says , publicly reprimanding them and threatening to discipline them for violations of the no spanish policy
managers repeatedly told them they could not speak spanish , but gave no such admonishments to people in albertsons uniforms who were not hispanic
albertsons cos. , based in boise , idaho , is one of the nations largest food and drug retailers , with 280,000 employees in 35 states
stores operate under 19 banners , including vons , safeway , amigos and pavilions
a california waiter refused to serve 4 latina customers until he saw proof of residency
violators were threatened with discipline , court documents say , and routinely received public reprimands like the one zamorano and stevenson say they got on that fall day in 2012
zamorano said she was once chastised for conversing in spanish with a spanish-speaking customer
zamorano had worked at albertsons for five years and stevenson had worked there for 23 years when the policy was implemented , their complaint says
after the dressing down , zamorano called the companys hotline to complain about browns conduct and the ban on spanish
after another dressing down a month later , zamorano requested a transfer to a different store , citing the no spanish police
stevenson also requested a transfer to a different store
in the complaint , she claimed the harassment and monitoring from management was making her anxious and physically sick
to feel comfortable , she and other employees would leave the stores premises to have lunch
in a statement , the eeoc said the stores actions violated title vii of the civil rights act of 1964
thursday was not the first time the eeoc had targeted albertsons for alleged discrimination
in 2009 , albertsons agreed to pay $ 8.9 million to settle three employment discrimination lawsuits filed by the agency on behalf of 168 former and current employees
those suits said minority employees at a colorado distribution facility were given harder work assignments and were disciplined more severely than their white counterparts for similar infractions
dozens of employees complained to management about the discrimination , and the complainers were passed over for promotions and even fired in retaliation , the eeoc said
minority employees were frequently subjected to negative , racially tinged comments , including the use of slurs for blacks and hispanics harassment that even extended to the bathroom
the eeoc said
the graffiti wasnt cleaned up for years , until the restroom was remodeled , the commission said
