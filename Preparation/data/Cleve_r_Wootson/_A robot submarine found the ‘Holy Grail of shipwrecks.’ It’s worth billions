spanish treasure fleets that traversed the atlantic ocean to the americas and back were a 16th-century invention as important as free two-day shipping
organized 70 years after columbuss first voyage , the fleet was made up of several specialized ships with one primary goal exploiting the riches of the new world as efficiently as possible
except when it didnt
it stands as one of the most expensive maritime losses in history
and the holy grail of shipwrecks stayed underwater , undiscovered for more than 300 years
enter a tiny submersible robot named remus 6000 packed with sensors and cameras and capable of diving four miles underwater that has discovered the centuries-old final resting place of the sunken ship
the unmanned underwater vehicle , operated by woods hole oceanographic institution ( whoi ) , uses far-reaching sonar to identify objects on the seafloor then circles back to take pictures of anything worthy of a closer look
remus 6000 has used the same tactic to find the remains of air france 447 , two years after it crashed off the coast of brazil in 2009
the wreckage of the san jos was discovered two years ago , but the location off the colombian port town of cartagena and other details have been closely held secrets
new details were released monday from the agencies involved in the search , including the colombian military that ferried remus 6000 to the search location
researchers realized what they had found from a key distinguishing feature
the small craft descended to just 30 feet above the wreck and snapped photos of those cannons
jeff kaeli , one of the engineers who operates the remus 6000 , said he was in his bunk when the first pictures came in
those who know the coordinates of the find have not expanded much beyond the robot and the engineer in part because the remains of the san jos are the subject of another international dispute
do the precious metals and emeralds at the bottom of the atlantic belong to the people of colombia or to the people of spain
whoi said in a news release about the find
still the researchers at woods hole say they have no financial stake in the haul
