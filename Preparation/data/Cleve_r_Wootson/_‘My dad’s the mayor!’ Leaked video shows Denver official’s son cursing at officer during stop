the video clip lasts just 20 seconds , but its long enough to anger anyone who believes public officials and their loved ones secretly suffer from a strong sense of entitlement
jordan hancock , the 22-year-old son of denver mayor michael b. hancock , had been clocked going 65 mph in a 40 mph zone in aurora , a suburb of denver
its unclear what preceded the heated exchange between the young man and the officer captured in the video , originally obtained by denver abc affiliate kmgh
but at some point , the 22-year-old unloads on the officer , spewing a stream of profanity and gay slurs and telling him his days as a police officer are coming to an end
my dads the mayor , he says , followed by some curse words
of denver
the officer responds.
well , youre in aurora.
guess what , im about to get you fired , jordan hancock replies , adding more expletives
that was march 23 , according to a police report
in the ticket , the officer wrote attitude very poor , see video.
jordan hancock appeared in court monday and agreed to pay a $ 250 fine , the news station reported
he told a judge he was speeding because he was running late
the mayor was traveling and not immediately available for comment , his spokesman , amber miller , told the washington post
jordan hancock also could not be reached
we 've addressed our son 's behavior at a traffic stop w/him
he 's apologized to the officer
while we do n't support nor condone his inexcusable actions & words , we love our son dearly & will work w/him to turn a personal mistake into a valuable lesson for himself & the community
the aurora police department said it was trying to determine how the video got into the hands of a reporter , according to a statement it sent to kmgh
the video has not been deemed public record and was released without departmental authorization
when it was leaked , it was also evidence from a matter that was pending before the citys municipal court , potentially jeopardizing the case
a california waiter refused to serve 4 latina customers until he saw proof of residency
still , the department said the unidentified officer in the video appears to have behaved appropriately
the statement said
both father and son have faced scrutiny in the past
as the washington posts kristine phillips wrote in march , the mayor acknowledged that he sent inappropriate text messages to a police officer who had been a member of his security detail in 2012.
you look sexy in all that black
he wrote to the woman
the city paid the officer , leslie branch-wise , $ 75,000 as part of a settlement
and in 2014 , according to the denver post , jordan hancock was inside an suv in nearby fort collins when a 19-year-old was shot and seriously injured following a reported shouting match between alleged rival gang members
but police said hancock and the other teens in the car misled officers about the shooting , saying the gunshot came from someone in the area and not from inside the vehicle
the post reported
a port authority official berated and cursed at officers during a traffic stop
a dash cam was on
in that incident , the mayors son was never charged with a crime
jordan hancocks most recent traffic stop is the second headline-making case thats sparked outrage at a seeming abuse of an official position in the past few weeks
last month , dash-cam video surfaced that featured a cursing and coercive commissioner of the port authority of new york and new jersey raging at officers who had pulled over her daughter and the younger womans friends
she said , early and often , that she is a friend of the tenafly , n.j. , mayor and also happens to be a personal acquaintance of the police chief
her daughter , she said , is a student at yale , and the younger womans friends attend mit and the officers were ruining what had been a nice easter weekend hike
the video was released via a public records request and , in a flash , turner became the latest prominent person to receive a public comeuppance after being caught on video lashing out at someone with a blue-collar job
