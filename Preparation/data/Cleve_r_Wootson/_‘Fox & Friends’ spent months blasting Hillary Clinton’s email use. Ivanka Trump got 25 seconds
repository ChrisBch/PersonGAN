fox & friends and many , many other fox news programs dedicated significant portions of its 2016 presidential campaign coverage to a question that seemed at the center of our faith in our republic
did hillary clintons rule-breaking use of private email to conduct government business render her unfit to serve in the topmost levels of the federal government
there was analysis about operational intel in the emails that could put u.s. citizens at risk
a question-and-answer segment focused on whether a hypothetical president hillary clinton could pardon herself
at one point , judge jeanine pirro demonstrated what it would be like to smash two blackberrys with a hammer
the segment lasted 25 seconds
the information was one of several news tidbits relayed to viewers of fox & friends by jillian mele , an early-morning host , and focused on ivanka trumps lawyer slamming a report.
media observers were quick to point out the irony
colby hall wrote in an opinion piece for mediaite.
if they didnt , theyd look ridiculous , right
as the washington posts carol d. leonnig and josh dawsey reported monday , ivanka trump sent hundreds of emails to cabinet officials , white house aides and assistants using a private account , which violated rules about federal records
according to leonnig and dawsey , shortly after then-candidate donald trump blasted clinton on the campaign trail , his daughter used her personal account for much of 2017 with jared kushner , her husband and fellow white house adviser
she sent hundreds of emails from the account
ivanka trumps use of the private account was unearthed by white house ethics officials responding to a public records lawsuit
people close to ivanka trump told leonnig and dawsey that she wasnt trying to hide her government work and was unaware she was breaking email rules
such use of email could violate the presidential records act , which requires official white house communications be preserved
its also a security and potential risk
the house oversight committee plans to investigate
fox news has faced criticism from those who have claimed the network serves as a mouthpiece for the trump administration
on the day before election day , for example , fox news host sean hannity joined president trump at a rally in cape girardeau , mo
the campaign had described hannity as a special guest.
hannity maintained on twitter that he was covering the rally for his show , not campaigning with the president
judge jeanine , the smasher of blackberrys , was also present and was singled out by trump
she treats us very , very well , trump told the audience.
shes my friend , and shes your friend.
