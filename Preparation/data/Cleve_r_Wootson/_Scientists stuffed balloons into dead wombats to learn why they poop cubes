of all the adaptations that allow our animal brethren to soar through the air or endure the darkness and crushing pressure of the oceans depths , there is one property that is unique in kingdom animalia
only wombats can produce cubical poop
but how does it get that way
and does it provide any evolutionary advantage to wombats as they take a trip on the circle of life
those questions about wombat poop have perplexed scientists since wombat-poop-studying scholars have existed , and the answers have eluded mankind until this precise moment in human history
now , we have answers , and they are distinctly intertwined with the nature of the australian animals
gauging wombats by sight alone , the marsupials are what scientists would officially refer to as cuddly
but in the wild , theyre pretty aggressive and territorial essentially cantankerous cousins of koalas
although its rare for wombats to attack humans , youtube videos abound of the muscular marsupials going after zookeepers , hissing and snorting at stunned videographers and startling bbc animal show hosts
in 2010 , an australian man killed a wombat with an ax after finding the aggressive marsupial waiting for him on his doormat
a witness told the australian broadcasting corporation , which said the wombat in question may have been in the advanced stages of mange
if a wombat comes across a strange wombat or a predator in the wild , its not unusual for fur to fly
still , wombats arent itching for a fight
theyre herbivores that subsist on roots and other plant matter , and usually attack only when threatened
mostly , they just want to be left alone
thats where the poop comes into play
wombats produce up to 100 cubes of poop each night and surround their mazelike dens with it to serve as a no trespassing sign to other wombats a border wall made out of poop , according to national geographic
wombats are nocturnal and have poor eyesight , so the wall is essentially made of smell
wombats that are better able to deter unwanted strangers are more likely to avoid conflict and injury , and thus increase their reproductive success , according to the magazine

but round poop rolls and cant stay in place on the ground or the logs and rocks that dot the wombats landscape
still , determining the biological mechanics of how wombat poop turns into a cube understandably took some particularly involved science
patricia yang , a postdoctoral fellow at georgia tech , has dedicated her young career to studying , in intricate detail , the biomechanics of how animals poop and pee
and the other golden rule )
last year , she delved into the hydrodynamics of defecation.
a significant chunk of her research involved her and other students going to atlantas zoo and taking slow-motion video of animals pooping and peeing
studying how nature has solved some of the problems of physics is a distinct branch of design known as biomimicry
excreting urine and feces is a biological function , but its also a physical action , using energy and specially made structures to move solids and liquids around
an elephants urinary tract , for example , can move nearly half a bathtub of water in 20 seconds
as yang says in her dissertation , its an example of scalable hydrodynamic systems.
studying how an elephant empties its bladder can provide insight into how to make a better fire hose or sewage pipe
biomimicry is particularly useful when designing systems to be more energy efficient and less wasteful
what is a more efficient user of solar energy than a blade of grass
but understanding the inner workings of wombats required yang to do much more than setting her video camera to slo-mo mode and dodging suspicious zookeepers
yang and other researchers acquired dead wombats that had been hit by cars in tasmania and euthanized by a veterinarian , according to her papers abstract
they emptied out the animals dietary tracts and filled it with a balloon , which they used to study the pressure exerted by the walls of the intestines
as a control , they similarly inflated pig intestines
they found that in the final 8 percent of the wombat intestines the homestretch of a two-week digestive process where wombat feces turns from a liquid into a solid the intestines are not uniformly elastic
this difference in elasticity molds the feces into a specific shape
the result perfectly stackable wombat poop , with a practical purpose that could cross into the human manufacturing industry
we currently have only two methods to manufacture cubes , yang told national geographic magazine
throughout history , humans have either cut cubes from hard materials or molded them from soft ones
wombats have a third way.
