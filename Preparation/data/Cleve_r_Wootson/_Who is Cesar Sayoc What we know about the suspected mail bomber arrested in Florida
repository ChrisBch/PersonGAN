on the internet and in real life , cesar sayoc was not shy about broadcasting his support for donald trump and his contempt for those the president might consider enemies
he plastered stickers across his white van supportive of trump alongside images of the presidents critics with red targets over their faces and a large decal that read cnn sucks.
on twitter , the 56-year-old trafficked conspiracy theories and ranted about liberal billionaire george soros , former president barack obama , former secretary of state hillary clinton and others whose politics were out of line with his
although officials declined to say what they believe motivated him , court records , his social media and those who know him make clear that sayoc was troubled and , at least in recent years , deeply partisan
ronald lowy , an attorney representing sayocs family members , said he believed sayoc was mentally ill and lived out of his vehicle for over a decade
sarah jane baumgartel , an attorney appointed friday to represent sayoc , declined to comment
said daniel lurvey , a lawyer who represented sayoc in the past
one of sayocs cousins , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said sayoc was a really good guy who wouldnt want to hurt anyone , and the bombs which didnt detonate were a hoax.
the cousin said that while he did not know sayoc to be political , he could intuit his relatives message
the cousin said that was a reference to holders quipping at a recent campaign event , when they go low , we kick them.
sayoc , a registered republican who lives in aventura , fla. , north of miami , attended brevard college in north carolina , where he was a member of the soccer team , according to a school yearbook
he also was listed as a member of the canterbury club , a religious organization
a yearbook photo showed him posing behind someone in a bishops robe
sayoc had worked in recent years as a pizza delivery driver
analysis the mail-bomb suspects van , annotated
that work history , though , seems to have been inflated
chippendales denied he was ever affiliated with the company
he also told co-workers that he was an american indian from the seminole tribe , that he lived on the reservation , and that he had done work for the seminole hard rock hotel & casino in hollywood , fla
but the seminole tribe of florida , seminole gaming and hard rock international said they could find no evidence to support that
his cousin said sayocs father is filipino and his mother is italian
lawyer david mcdonald , who questioned sayoc for the deposition , said sayoc was glib and articulate , but also maybe delusional.
sayoc was no stranger to law enforcement , racking up several arrests for larceny , fraud and drug possession
in 2002 , police in miami charged sayoc with calling florida power & light and threatening to blow up the electric utility
the report claims sayoc said it would be worse than sept. 11.
he ultimately pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation
discussing an arrest for a bomb threat in a later deposition , sayoc said he was joking around , but that the bomb squad had showed up at his dry-cleaning store
analysis false flag hoaxes about bombing suspect persist , despite evidence and a trump shrine on wheels
lowy , a miami attorney , said he is representing sayocs mother , madeline giardiello , and sisters sabrina and tina
giardiello , 76 , has been active in democratic politics and was an officer on her condominium board in aventura for many years , lowy said
she has not spoken to her son in three years , and he never showed an interest in politics when he and his family were last in touch , lowy said
lowy said he represented sayoc on a number of matters over the years , which he called unsophisticated , stupid stuff.
another cousin , lenny altieri , 67 , said sayoc had worked for years at various adult entertainment clubs in south florida
he last saw sayoc at a holiday gathering five years ago , and he said sayoc sent some racist texts to him afterward
sayocs support of trump seemed to predate the election he tweeted his support of trump and his presidential campaign as far back as may 2016
at one point , a video clip shows , sayoc attended a trump rally
he seemed to be fixated on trumps opponents
one account in his name mentioned soros 34 times , obama 29 times and clinton 21 times over the years
social media account tied to mail-bomb suspect singled out democrats
of holder , to whom authorities say sayoc sent a package , the florida man once wrote this man murdered for political reasons and got away with it.
the charges against sayoc assert that he posted a message critical of soros as recently as wednesday
that was after authorities had recovered the package directed to the billionaire
gureghian , the general manager of new river pizza and fresh kitchen , said that sayoc worked as a delivery-truck driver for several months but quit in january
the white van he drove to deliver pizzas was covered in disturbing images , she said , so the restaurant required him to park it on the side where it could not be seen
sayoc was kept on because he did his work reliably and good drivers are hard to find , she said
but he disturbed his co-workers with racist comments and texts , she said
gureghian , who is lesbian , said that sayoc made constant remarks about her sexuality
she said sayoc quit in january and told her he had trained to be a truck driver hauling hazardous materials , with a top secret clearance
