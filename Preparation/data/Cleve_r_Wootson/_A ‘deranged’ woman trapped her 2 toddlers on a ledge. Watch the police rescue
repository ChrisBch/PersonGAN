officer rob addea positioned himself directly beneath the narrow , rain-slicked ledge and pleaded with the paranoid woman above
it was 4 p.m. saturday , and police in delray beach , fla. , had apparently just stumbled into someones madness
a 23-year-old mother , who police said was agitated , deranged and high on the narcotic molly , was hallucinating and becoming increasingly unstable , as the worried neighbors who called 911 could clearly see
worst of all , she had brought her 1-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter onto the slippery ledge with her , and the toddlers were terrified
a police report said
officers scrambled to the scene , improvising a plan to rescue the children and subdue their mother their moves captured by body cameras in footage that was ultimately uploaded to the departments facebook page
but this situation was dire
it was raining
one child was wearing just leggings another only a diaper
the only thing that separated them from a potentially deadly fall was a few inches of an overhang and a flimsy rain gutter
their mother was very fragile emotionally , police said , and appeared to be getting worse
if he burst into the house and dashed up the stairs , the sudden move could startle the woman into doing something rash , and he wouldnt be there to catch a falling child
as other officers sped to the scene , addea knew what he had to do let me just buy us time , he told himself
this photo of an officer comforting a baby went viral
but theres more to the story
but how do you reason with a person who may be beyond reason
the woman thought that the officers were lying to her about who they really were and that they would kill her and her children
she thought someone had hacked into her phone
escalating matters , the police were being subsumed into her hallucination to her , the officer telling her everything would be okay was one of the evil agents who had come for her , addea said
he also worried about physics
the ledge was wet and slightly sloped
the children were barefoot
he pushed those thoughts away as other officers arrived.
we needed a team effort to get to her , he recalled
he reassured the woman that she wasnt in trouble , that he was there to help and that , yes , he was an actual police officer
other officers went for tools to break down the homes front door , but one person standing outside gave them the door code
a little later , they were inside the house , up the stairs and on the ledge.
were here to help , okay , one officer said
it was , addea believes , the most dangerous moment of the whole encounter no one knew how the woman would react to the sudden presence of officers on the ledge
and the children were still vulnerable in her grasp
the woman began screaming at addeas colleagues sgt
brian griffith and sgt
mike debree repeating her claims that they werent real police officers
she threw her cellphone to the ground
griffith flipped open his badge and held it out to the woman
debree edged closer to the children
then , he clamped a hand around each of their arms
the children screamed as they were gripped by a stranger.
help me
the girl shrieked.
im scared
its unclear whether she was more afraid of the height , her mothers unstable moment or the things she had been warned about the officer
a 7-year-old told her bus driver she couldnt wake her parents
police found them dead at home
slowly , the children were led through a neighbors window
officers wrestled the flailing woman into handcuffs
she had taken the narcotic molly , the street name for mdma , police later learned
the drug exacerbated an unidentified preexisting mental condition , sparking the paranoia and hallucinations , police said
the woman whose identity was not released was taken to a hospital for treatment and faces two charges of child abuse when she gets out
her boyfriend , who authorities say provided the drug , also could be charged
the department of children and families took custody of the children
on thursday morning , days after the rescue , addea said the entire time he was in the situation , he was trying to quell a roller coaster of emotions so no one ended up hurt
he received his assurance a few minutes after the situation was defused , as he shifted from ending a crisis to writing a police report
for a moment , he watched the children , who were now safe
