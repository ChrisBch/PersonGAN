but that is not all that they unearthed
should the fate of a 150-million-year-old fossil lie in the hands of one deep-pocketed person who happens to be the highest bidder
or should it be controlled by a museum or another authority who can ensure that it can be studied by scientists and preserved for posterity
the t. rex that got away smithsonians quest for sue ends with different dinosaur
the dinosaur in question was dug up between 2013 and 2015 and may be a relative of the allosaurus , a jurassic-era biped that was among the earliest and most widely studied dinosaur discoveries , according to live science
eric mickeler , who works for the aguttes auction house that organized the bidding battle , told agence france-presse that the dinosaur is the only one of its species that has been discovered
eric geneste , a dinosaur expert , told the news organization that scientists cant classify the dino as an allosaurus yet
the number of teeth dont match up , and the new dinosaur has longer shoulder blades
obviously , the wyoming fossil needs additional study , scientists say
but paleontologists worry they may never get a close enough look at it because the fossil belongs to a private buyer , not a person or an organization bound by the mores and rules of the greater scientific community
a few weeks ago , the society of vertebrate paleontology , which represents more than 2,000 students and professionals , asked the auction house to scuttle the sale
the society said in an open letter
the person who bought the dinosaur doesnt exactly plan to make it the centerpiece of a fountain in his french villa , auctioneers said
the buyer , identified only as a british businessman , has pledged to lend it to a museum and said that it will be made available to scientists
auctioneer claude aguttes told reuters
but the buyer has remained at least publicly silent on another issue that is vexing scientists if it is a new species , who gets to name it
the society said
still , its unclear whether the owner was influenced by the near-promise made on page 51 of the auction brochure
