the black women waiting for aaa said they could smell the alcohol on the breath of susan westwood , the slurring , unsteady white woman who had approached them in a dark parking lot in charlotte
but westwood had no trouble conveying a racially tinged message straight out of the jim crow era
she is white , she told the two black women , and a resident of the apartment complex in one of the citys most exclusive neighborhoods where they happened to be standing
she makes $ 125,000 a year and pays hefty rent , and her children attend myers park high school
i am white and hot
so what are you doing here
mary garriss night had started to sour even before westwood sauntered up
she was visiting her sister , leisa , on oct. 19 , but when she went to leave , her car would not start
they got on the phone with aaa , but the call was interrupted by westwoods meandering tirade
so instead , the sisters used the cellphone to record the moment when waiting for a tow truck became yet another thing you can not do while black
but people who suddenly found themselves on the receiving end of racial harassment have been empowered by a new weapon cellphones
recordings of the incidents have sparked viral videos and spontaneous hashtagged nicknames for people such as bbqbecky and permitpatty , who have been scorned publicly and on social media and , in some cases , fired from their jobs
westwood has become known as southparksusan
but the garris sisters encounter went beyond an uncomfortable moment for a black person in a public space , as westwood escalated to profanity , racial stereotypes , then threats
westwood demanded to know where the women lived and screamed , youre not going to sell drugs here
then she warned it could be dangerous hanging out in the mostly white neighborhood
the sisters growing unease was reflected in the 911 call that leisa garris placed after retreating to an apartment balcony
no one was injured , but officers who arrived found westwoods actions merited criminal charges
westwood could not immediately be reached for comment
according to officer keith trietley , a charlotte-mecklenburg police department spokesman , westwood has been charged with two counts of communicating threats and two counts of simple assault
the police report is scant but notes that leisa garris does , in fact , live at the apartment complex in question
the drunken outburst also cost westwood her job at the local cable company that paid her $ 125,0000 and allowed her to live in the exclusive community
even days later , the incident and the fact they could be accosted and threatened by a woman they had never met still stung
