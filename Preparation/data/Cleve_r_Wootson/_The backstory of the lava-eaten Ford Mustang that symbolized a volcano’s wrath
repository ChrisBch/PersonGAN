the lava inched toward mike hales property in a slow , unstoppable wave , consuming everything it touched
suddenly the math for the hawaii resident was devastatingly simple too many possessions , not enough time
the rest of the world has seen the dramatic end of that calculus hales silver ford mustang , melted by a smoking flow of lava from hawaiis kilauea volcano
that instant symbolism was not missed by hale as he took stock of the loss of his leilani estates home in an interview with wxchasing.com , a site that records videos of extreme weather phenomena
before an evacuation order was put in place , hale hatched a plan to save whatever he could
there was nothing anyone could do to save his house
but he called his friends and asked them to help round up his possessions in the time before the eruption
critical among them the several cars on his property that are the lifeblood of a small car-rental business
because it couldnt simply be started and moved , the mustang went to the bottom of the priority list , along with the truck
to live on a volcano is to accept risk
on hawaiis big island , the risk has become reality
hale said he forgot about the vehicles as his focus shifted to retrieving valuables from inside his house and to the seismic activity outside of it
before the eruption , there were six to 10 earthquakes every hour , hale said
three volcanic fissures had opened on mohala street , yards from his house
and he was also wary of the warnings about noxious gases that can be more dangerous than slow-moving lava
it mirrored the larger devastation on hawaiis big island , as the washington posts amy b wang wrote
on april 30 , the floor of a crater on top of the volcano collapsed , sending its pool of lava back underground and causing small earthquakes
scientists predicted the magma would travel elsewhere and push its way back to the surface somewhere in the east rift zone
they were correct
days later , the ground split open on the east side of the islands leilani estates neighborhood , exposing an angry red beneath the lush landscape
from the widening gash , molten rock burbled and splashed , then shot dozens of feet in the air
officials called it active volcanic fountaining.
some residents insisted it was pele , the hawaiian volcano goddess , coming to reclaim her land
hundreds of residents were ordered to flee amid threats of fires and extremely high levels of dangerous sulfur dioxide gas
as hale collected valuables , he tried keep track of the people risking their lives to help him , making sure no one was in danger
he was safe on another part of the island as his mustang melted , its final moments captured by a videographer
all hale saw was smoke rising from his community
as the video of his melting car spread , he was setting up tents to serve as temporary storage for neighbors orphaned belongings
and when he finally saw the video , his attention was not on the car at all
instead he fixated on his r2d2 mailbox
his daughter had made it for him a few christmases ago
that had sentimental value , he said.
the mustang , i do have other cars.
still , the melting car was featured in a gofundme account someone had set up on his behalf
