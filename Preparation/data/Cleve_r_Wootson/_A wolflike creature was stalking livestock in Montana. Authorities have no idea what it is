but when he summoned wildlife officials to investigate , something was off
the dead animals canine teeth were too short , the front paws were tiny for a wolf , and the claws on those paws were too long
the ears were too big as well , experts told the washington post , and the coat was wrong
this was no wolf
it was a young , non-lactating female and a canid , or member of the dog family , montana wildlife officials concluded , but thats about as far as animal experts got
but from that vacuum of information has sprung not-quite-educated guesses from armchair taxonomists and conspiracy theorists people who have spent entirely too much time staring at a picture of a carcass of a wolfish creature on the tailgate of a pickup truck
their leading theories about the mystery creature
its bigfoot because its large and hairy and unexplained
some dogmen look like a stretched-out dog that walks on two feet
others look like a sasquatch with a dobermans face
dire wolves were real
now someone is trying to resurrect them
there has been only one reported dogman sighting in montana , according to the dogman encounters website , which includes a handy map
its a dire wolf the creature got too close to livestock , not prince joffrey of the game of thrones fame , and although winterfell is actually a real place you can visit , its nowhere near denton , mont
dire wolves were native to the americas and larger than their cousins , the gray wolf
but they went extinct more than 10,000 years ago
thousands of dire wolf skeletons have been found in the la brea tar pits in los angeles
auchly , with montana fish , wildlife and parks , doesnt put much stock in that theory
but it could be a dire wolf 2.0
a breeder in southern oregon has spent the past three decades trying to create a new sort of dog called the american alsatian that would look very much like the extinct species and the animals given to the children of house stark
its a wolf-dog hybrid wolves and dogs are interfertile , according to the international wolf center , meaning they can interbreed and produce offspring that can then produce more offspring
hybrids can be unpredictable
when wolves reach sexual maturity , hormonal changes can trigger behavior changes , making animals more stubborn or aggressive , the wolf center says
theyre more likely to challenge the human leader of the pack , even if that leader is a person who picked up a wolf-looking puppy because it looked cool
abandonments are commonplace once people discover their animals may be difficult to control
wildlife officials , for some reason , are not relying on the armchair theories about the wolflike creature
they sent the carcass to the departments lab in bozeman
researchers there will take tissue samples and ship them to the u.s
fish and wildlife service laboratory in oregon
there , scientists will extra dna from cells looking for specific dna markers , which will be compared with those of known species
