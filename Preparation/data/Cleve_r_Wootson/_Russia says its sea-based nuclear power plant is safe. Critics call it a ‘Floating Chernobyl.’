the reactor in question is called akademik lomonosov
but environmental groups have other names for the barge nuclear titanic is one
another is floating chernobyl.
critics say that pretty much the worst thing you can do to a nuclear reactor is expose it to the high waves and fierce winds of the arctic ocean
jan haverkamp , a nuclear expert for greenpeace central and eastern europe , called it a shockingly obvious threat to a fragile environment.
the world will see who is right sometime next year
lomonosov , named after an 18th-century russian scientist and poet , was towed out of the st. petersburg shipyard on saturday for its meandering , year-long journey , the associated press reported
vitaly trunev , the head of rosenergoatom , a nuclear power station subsidiary of rosatom , told reuters during the launch , addressing the most obvious question.
it is protected from all kinds of natural and technical harms.
there are skeptics , including 11,000 people who have signed a petition hoping to sink plans to launch the vessel
and , for a time , the vessel made a sizable chunk of st. petersburg nervous
the barge was supposed to be equipped with nuclear fuel at the city 's shipyard , rosatom said , but city leaders thought better of fueling a first-of-its-kind nuclear reactor in the middle of a city of nearly 5.3 million people
and russia 's baltic sea neighbors worried about what would happen if a nuclear reactor en route encountered bad weather or technical issues too close to their fjords
so the ship sans nuclear fuel will be pulled through the baltic sea , around the northern tip of norway to murmansk , a russian city of more than 300,000 residents , where it will be fueled
it will ultimately be anchored near the kamchatka peninsula in northeast russia , and moored off the coast of pevek , where it will replace an aging reactor
theres a small chance an asteroid will smack into earth in 2135
nasa is working on a plan
by 2019 , the first-of-its-kind rig will provide power for the port town and for oil rigs
for rosatom , it is buoyant proof of concept that a floating sea-based reactor can work
rosatom is in talks with potential buyers in southeast asia , latin america and africa , according to russian television station rt , which estimates that 15 countries have shown interest in the floating plants
greenpeace has several concerns about the plan , haverkamp said
it has written reports about what it calls rosatom 's checkered past and criticized the company 's plans to use its latest venture to drill for fossil fuels
rosatom , a conglomeration of nuclear-related industries under the russian government , produces nearly 20 percent of russia 's electricity , according to its website
among its activities , the company also mines uranium
but greenpeace says rosatom 's latest venture , the floating nuclear barge , is dicey
and there are , of course , dozens of nuclear-powered vessels that spend almost their entire life at sea
according to the world nuclear association , about 140 ships mostly submarines , but also icebreakers and aircraft carriers prowl the world 's oceans
the first nuclear-powered submarine was launched in 1955
that could be a point for either side some nuclear-powered submarines have been in service for years
but accidents involving nuclear-powered submarines have occurred
in one case , an explosion killed 10 and injured 49 in 1985 on russia 's pacific coast , according to the maritime executive
