seven days after bill cosby was convicted on three counts of sexual assault , camille o. cosby offered a fiery defense of her husband , the iconic entertainer
her nearly 800-word statement , posted to facebook thursday morning , likened her husbands ordeal to the racially charged killing of emmett till and called the accusations and ensuing conviction mob justice , not real justice.
camille cosby also called for a criminal investigation into the pennsylvania prosecutor behind her husbands conviction
bill cosby was found guilty last week of assaulting andrea constand , the only woman among dozens of accusers to bring criminal charges against the disgraced comedian
a jury took less than two days to convict cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting constand in 2004
a temple university womens basketball operations director more than three decades his junior , constand was lured by cosby into his home with promises of mentorship
the conviction could put the 80-year-old comedian in prison for the rest of his life
bill cosby convicted on three counts of sexual assault
no sentencing date has been set
the conviction comes in a retrial of a 2017 case in which a mistrial was declared
bill and camille cosby have been married since 1964 , and she is said to have inspired his characters wife , clair huxtable ( played by phylicia rashad , who also defended her former co-star , before his conviction )
camille cosby remained by her husbands side as the number of accusations against him grew , though she rarely spoke publicly about the case
in 2014 , she broke her silence with a statement questioning the portrayal of her husband by the media , likening it to the explosive , untrue story rolling stone had published about campus rape at the university of virginia
that statement reads.
an accusation is published , and immediately goes viral
we all followed the story of the article in the rolling stone concerning allegations of rape at the university of virginia
the story was heart-breaking , but ultimately appears to be proved to be untrue
camille cosbys recent statement also laments the cutting back of syndicated airings of the cosby show and the rescinding of honorary degrees the comedian received
the series started to disappear from cable networks like tv land after the accusations began
bounce tv , a network owned by katz broadcasting that airs programs geared toward black audiences , removed the cosby show from its schedule after the verdict , according to deadline
ohio state , brown , tufts , fordham , baylor , oberlin college , university of pennsylvania , university of san francisco and boston university revoked degrees from bill cosby before the conviction
afterward , yale university rescinded an honorary degree for the first time in its history , joining temple university , johns hopkins , carnegie mellon , notre dame and wesleyan university
here is camille cosbys statement , in full
clearly , most people were not included in that original draft of the constitution no women , native americans , poor white men and , absolutely , no enslaved africans
what have the masses of people done who are treated as outcasts by we the people
they , through the purity of the unceasing human spirit , forced 27 amendments to the constitution that have guaranteed fundamental rights to all peoplefinally doing what the framers should have done in 1787
now enters an american citizen , bill cosby
bill cosby was labelled as guilty because the media and accusers said so period
and the media ensured the dissemination of that propaganda by establishing barricades preventing the dissemination of the truth in violation of the protections of the first amendment
are the media now the peoples judges and juries
since when are all accusers truthful
history disproves thatfor example , emmett tills accuser immediately comes to mind
in 1955 , she testified before a jury of white men in a mississippi courtroom that a 14-year-old african american boy had sexually assaulted her , only to later admit several decades later in 2008 that her testimony was false
a more recent example is the case of darryl hunt , an african american who in 1984 was wrongfully convicted for the rape and murder of a white woman , only to have dna evidence establish in 1994 that he did not commit the crime
nonetheless he was held in prison until 2004 , serving almost twenty years behind bars , until the true rapist confessed to the crimes
these are just two of many tragic instances of our justice system utterly and routinely failing to protect african americans falsely accused in so-called courts of law and the entirely unfair court of public opinion
although the smithsonians hierarchy did not capitulate , a disclaimer was posted on the exterior of that museum
and all of that occurred before the trial even started
the worst injustices , however , have been carried out in the pennsylvania montgomery county courthouse
three criminal charges , promised during an unethical campaign for the district attorneys office , were filed against my husbandall based on what i believe to be a falsified account by the newly elected district attorneys key witness
i firmly believe her recent testimony during trial was perjured as was shown at trial , it was unsupported by any evidence and riddled with innumerable , dishonest contradictions
moreover , bill cosbys defense team introduced the testimony of a witness who confirmed that the district attorneys witness admitted that she had not been sexually assaulted , but that she could say she was and get money which is exactly what she did
i am publicly asking for a criminal investigation of that district attorney and his cohorts
this is a homogeneous group of exploitive and corrupt people , whose primary purpose is to advance themselves professionally and economically at the expense of mr. cosbys life
if they can do this to mr. cosby , they can do so to anyone
how much longer will we , the majority of the people , tolerate judicial , executive , legislative , media and corporate abuses of power
we , the majority of the people , must make america what it has declared itself to be.a democracynot to be destroyed by vicious , lying , self-absorbed paradigms of evilness
once again , an innocent person has been found guilty based on an unthinking , unquestioning , unconstitutional frenzy propagated by the media and allowed to play out in a supposed court of law
this is mob justice , not real justice
this tragedy must be undone not just for bill cosby , but for the country
i wish to thank the witnesses who courageously came forward at trial to testify as to the truth , as well as those witnesses who would have done so but for the judge preventing them from testifying
someday the truth will prevail , it always does
