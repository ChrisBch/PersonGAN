hours after authorities hauled away a new jersey couple 's bmw allegedly bought with donations that were supposed to help a homeless veteran get off the street , the online fundraising company gofundme announced that there would be a six-figure happy ending for johnny bobbitt
or , at least , happy-ish
the company also said it was cooperating with the investigation looking at what , exactly , kate mcclure and mark d'amico did with all the money that stemmed from a heartwarming story about an off-ramp rescue and soured into something much worse
last week , bobbitt filed a lawsuit against the couple , alleging they withheld most of the money and spent it on vacations , gambling and a new bmw
a judge gave mcclure and d'amico until this past monday to hand over the remaining money , according to the philadelphia inquirer
but a day after the deadline , an attorney for bobbitt said there was no money left to surrender
bobbitt 's legal team has asked judge paula t. dow to force the couple to stay in new jersey , give up their passports and not spend any money from their bank accounts , the inquirer reported
the judge also ordered the couple to appear in court , saying that she had heard enough from their attorney , according to cnn
mcclure and d'amico started the crowdfunding campaign after bobbitt came to mcclure 's rescue on the side of the road in october
mcclure had run out of gas on interstate 95 in philadelphia , and bobbitt walked to a service station and spent $ 20 of his own money to buy her gas
mcclure and d'amico could not be reached for comment friday morning
there are conflicting reports from the couple and bobbitt about how the money was used and whether bobbitt was a participant or a victim
initially , the crowdfunding campaign was a heartwarming story
mcclure and d'amico said they hoped the money would buy bobbitt , among other things , his own home and his dream truck a 1999 ford ranger
that holiday season they made a christmas-card-ready trio , baking cookies and wearing holidays onesies at the couple 's burlington home
but signs that things had gone awry piled up
bobbitt met with a financial adviser but never had access to the money or signed paperwork for a trust , according to the inquirer
but bobbitt said he saw troubling signs
mcclure is a receptionist for the new jersey department of transportation , and damico is a carpenter , according to the inquirer
but suddenly , she had a new bmw , and the couple were taking vacations to florida , california and las vegas , bobbitt told the inquirer
he learned of a helicopter ride they took over the grand canyon
and bobbitt told the inquirer that damico gambled away some of the gofundme money at a casino in philadelphia
damico told the newspaper that he had indeed used $ 500 from the bank account to gamble on a night when he forgot his sugarhouse casino card but had quickly repaid the money with his winnings
the couple have denied that they used any more of the money for anything else for themselves
bobbitt and his attorney disagreed , saying the shiny bmw in mcclure 's driveway was proof
on thursday , police officers and a tow truck showed up at the couple 's home to confiscate it
the couple 's home was searched as part of a criminal investigation , burlington county prosecutor scott coffina said in a statement , but charges have not been filed , cnn reported
during the search , the couple looked unhurried
tv news footage showed d'amico swinging a golf club on the lawn as officers carried boxes of evidence out of his house
he fiddled with his baseball cap and played fetch with a dog
mcclure stayed mostly out of sight before driving away in a white sedan
gofundme made its announcement later that day
but that policy has limits
donors who find evidence of misuse can get a refund of up to $ 1,000 , and intended recipients who do n't get the money raised on their behalf can get a maximum of $ 25,000
but the company removed the cap in bobbitt 's case , along with a restriction requiring claims about malfeasance to be made in 30 days
through the entire ordeal , bobbitt 's situation has not significantly improved
he spent most of the summer sleeping under a bridge in philadelphia near the same spot where mcclure 's suv sputtered to a stop in front of him last year
gofundme has put $ 20,000 in a bank account to help him as the investigation continues , the inquirer reported
it 's unclear when he would get the rest
