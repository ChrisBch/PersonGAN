but as the nation mourned the anniversary of the san juans disappearance thursday , painful questions lingered what horrible tragedy had befallen the submarine
and , most importantly , would the craft and the bodies of the 44 sailors aboard ever be recovered
in a bittersweet announcement saturday , authorities said they may soon have answers to those twin mysteries
the san juan has been found nearly 3,000 feet beneath the oceans surface in waters off the valdes peninsula in argentine patagonia , according to the associated press
argentine defense minister oscar aguad later said the government lacked the proper technology to recover the submarine , adding that officials still need to determine next steps , the ap said
dozens heard amelia earharts final , chilling pleas for help , researchers say
almost exactly a year ago , the diesel-electric ara san juan was returning to its base south of buenos aires after a routine mission to ushuaia , near the southern tip of south america , the argentine navy said
then , suddenly , it went silent
if trouble arose , the crew of the submarine was supposed to surface and essentially phone home , but that never happened
still , hope lingered despite the radio silence
the submarine was full of dozens of trained and resourceful sailors
and the san juan had multiple ways of communicating , as well as an ample supply of food and oxygen
even if the sub couldnt communicate or surface , authorities hoped they could find it before it was too late
the argentine navy called in reinforcements from up and down the western hemisphere , an international team from the united states , britain , brazil and chile and a dozen other countries combining manpower and technological know-how
but in those initial days of the search , the news kept getting worse
the search-and-rescue ships were battered by 50 mph winds and 20 foot waves , sour weather that complicated the effort to find a craft that had a finite amount of food and air
and authorities disclosed that just before the sub went missing , the captain reported that water had entered the engines snorkel and short-circuited one of the subs batteries , although he said the issue had been contained , according to the associated press
the german-built craft was refitted between 2008 and 2014 , a complicated process in which the submarine was cut in half before the engines and batteries were replaced , the associated press said
but even a tiny mistake during the refit could potentially put ship and crew at risk
a short time after the captains warning , an explosion was detected near the last known location of the submarine
the navy has said a concentration of hydrogen caused by the battery problem could be responsible for the blast
but investigators found responsibility also lay up and down the military ladder
president mauricio macri promised a full investigation into the blast , the associated press reported , and appointed a federal judge to oversee the probe
police raided naval bases as part of the investigation in january and the head of the navy was dismissed
the investigation found that navy officials allowed the submarine to go on an extended mission despite the mechanical problems
but as military officials faced repercussions on land , the location of the sub remained a mystery , and the search continued
in september , the argentine government contracted the u.s. company ocean infinity , known for finding wrecks lost at sea
the government said it would pay the company $ 7.5 million if it found the location of the missing submarine , according to abc news
this week , the company sent out mini-submarines to the seabed and one ultimately returned with definitive photo evidence of the wreckage on the last day of the companys mission
