mason , ohio for months , a loud and acrimonious campaign for ohios 1st congressional district has played out in the cincinnati area between incumbent republican steve chabot and his challenger , hamilton county clerk of courts aftab pureval
gordon marsh , shuffling across a strip mall parking lot , was quick with a blunt assessment.
im voting against chabot , he said.
im not crazy about pureval , either.
but marsh said his choice had little to do with the local candidates or issues
it was all about donald trump
less than a month from the midterm elections , dozens of congressional races are tightening as campaigns make their final push
democrats are aiming most acutely at nearly two dozen seats held by republicans but won in 2016 by democrat hillary clinton , figuring those are the easiest to pick off
the next ring of interest are districts the president won , but narrowly
in those districts , located mainly in the suburbs and exurbs such as those outside cincinnati , des moines and greensboro , n.c. , the presidents shadow is looming so large that it obscures everything else
the president has sought to make the election revolve around an improving economy and the dire results he says would emanate from a democratic takeover of one or both chambers of congress
but he has also contended that he is on the ballot and voters in those districts agree
trumps ability to dominate the political conversation has put congressional candidates from both parties in a tricky spot
for republicans , the risk is sticking close to a president with immense star power among the maga faithful but who is radioactive to other voters
for democrats , the options are attacking trump and appearing to be members of a leftist mob , or staying mum and turning off voters eager for an aggressive check on the president
north carolinas 13th district stretches from the suburbs north of charlotte to greensboro
battered by the loss of the states textile industry , the region features a strong mix of left-leaning voters in the cities , conservative rural voters and a bipartisan mix in the suburbs
republicans were ordered to redraw the district in 2016 following a gerrymandering lawsuit
trump won the district in 2016 by 9 points his smallest margin in a north carolina republican district
the republican incumbent , rep. ted budd , is a gun store owner seeking reelection after he emerged from a 17-person primary in 2016
kathy manning , a greensboro lawyer and community organizer , is making her first bid for elected office
manning has steered away from addressing the president directly and insisted that voters are talking about kitchen table issues.
still , without mentioning trump by name , she said voters are fed up with the atmosphere in washington
budd , however , has embraced trump wholeheartedly , while conceding that his style is different from the presidents
north carolinians on both sides of the party divide say trump not only is a significant part of the decision between budd and manning , but has also changed the tenor of local politics
the same is true for every race in the 13th district , he said
the timbre of the races has become more contentious in the past two years , sometimes devolving into name-calling and animus , smith said
in august , tempers flared after someone defaced a confederate monument that stands just outside city hall
later , ku klux klan fliers tied to rocks were thrown into yards in suburban neighborhoods
andrew poston , a 25-year-old teacher , said he leans republican but would have trouble voting for anyone who wouldnt be a check on trump
i hope cooler heads prevail.
halfway across the country , iowas 3rd congressional district includes des moines and suburban and rural areas west and southwest of the city
the number of democratic , republican and independent voters is nearly equal
trump won by only 3 percentage points in 2016
republican incumbent david young , the mild-mannered grandson of a farmer and a preacher , is the opposite of trump in style , comfortable hosting low-key forums and roundtables where he talks about the nitty-gritty details of a pending farm bill
seeking to unseat him is cindy axne , a political newcomer and small-business owner who casts herself as the washington outsider and young as a politician who works for corporations and not for iowans
if elected , she would be the first woman to represent the district in congress
young rarely invokes trump saying hes different , both stylistically and morally
hes not accountable to trump , he says , but to the people in the 3rd district although he did speak at the presidents recent rally in council bluffs
axne has drawn on the energy released by opposition to the president
she casts the race in stark terms the heart and the soul of the country is at risk.
for des moines democrat penny murphy , the race is less about the candidates than the president
staying at home on election day is not a choice , murphy said as she ate lunch at palmers deli & market in des moines
charles ruby , 55 , said he usually ignores the midterm elections
but this time around , he voted early , stopping by on his motorcycle at a polling site in adel , a small town outside of des moines
the whole kavanaugh debacle , he said , is his prime motivator for voting
ohios 1st district includes cincinnatis hamilton county and , since 2010 , when the state legislature redrew the lines , traditionally conservative warren county
the incumbent , chabot , was first elected in 1994
a folksy , family-values conservative , chabot has held his seat for 22 of the past 24 years
trump took the district in 2016 by 6 points
the districts realignment gave republicans a tight hold on the seat for a few years , but urban sprawl reaching into warren county has helped make the 2018 election surprisingly close
challenger pureval , 36 years old and the son of indian and tibetan immigrants , has anchored his campaign in the contrasts between his agenda and the incumbents
but he largely keeps trump out of his message
thats exactly what i plan to do.
until very recently , chabot also kept his distance from the president
in march 2016 , when trump was the front-runner to capture the republican nomination , the congressman penned an open letter to the candidate urging trump to stop saying thuggish things.
his campaign and allies , however , have engaged in raw personal assaults , at one point seeking to tie pureval to libyan terrorists
nonetheless , ohioans said the president was at the center of their decision
parking his car outside a downtown cincinnati bank branch , michael southern admitted he did not know much about either chabots or purevals platforms
when he votes in november , it will be based on each candidates stance on the president
but again , the president was key
