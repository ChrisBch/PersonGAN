for one robo-call producer speaking into a microphone in what we can only assume is a dark basement , the answer is clear an 11th-hour infusion of good old-fashioned racism
the robo-call begins , before spewing nearly 60 seconds of racism coupled with a dash of anti-semitism
georgians began hearing the call last week , according to the hill
the video is made by theroadtopower.com , an anti-semitic video podcasting website that the anti-defamation league says has zeroed in on divisive political campaigns across the country , including two of the three races that feature a black candidate for governor
its unclear how many oprah winfrey robo-calls have been received
the robo-call labels abrams a poor mans aunt jemima , a reference to the black lady on the front of the pancake mix box , an image that has itself been derided as a racist symbol
it suggests that winfrey is a media construction made to trick fat , white women into voting
and it mocks what winfrey has called one of her all-time happiest moments in media
oprah winfrey says a 2020 presidential run would kill me
in a statement , the abrams campaign called the robo-calls a desperate and vile attempt to sway voters using poisonous thinking.
abrams spokeswoman abigail collazo said in the statement , which tried to link the robo-calls to a tone set by president trump and abramss republican opponent , brian kemp
in a statement emailed to the hill , kemp called the robo-call vile , racist and absolutely disgusting.
i stand against any person or organization that peddles this type of unbridled hate and unapologetic bigotry , he said
but abrams said monday that kemp has been racially insensitive in the past
she also addressed the racist attacks in the robo-call

the insidious tone of the poor-audio call was at odds with winfreys words on the campaign trail
she and abrams are both black women from mississippi , and the media titan spoke of the sacrifices their ancestors had to make to obtain the right to vote
she told voters
hi , im oprah the georgia governors race is at full boil and now the cavalry has arrived
well , hello there , that call begins , as the sounds of drums and monkeys can be heard in the background , according to the new york times.
i is andrew gillum.
the speaker goes on to say gillum will pass a law letting african americans evade arrest if the negro know fo sho he didnt do nothin
in a statement emailed to the washington post , gillum campaign spokesman geoff burgan said this is reprehensible and could only have come from someone with intentions to fuel hatred and seek publicity
