scientists have an imprecise understanding of the obscure phenomenon of mass whale strandings , when large numbers of the marine mammals suddenly beach themselves often their final acts
but such strandings are mostly solo occurrences they usually do not involve scores of whales
a hikers grim discovery in new zealands mason bay over the weekend remains a heartbreaking mystery
there , lying in a jagged line on the remote beach , were more than 140 immobile animals two full pods of pilot whales , dead or dying in the sun
because of the remote location mason bay is on new zealands southernmost island , which has a population of fewer than 400 authorities said they werent able to gather enough people to help the whales get back into the pacific ocean in time
that left just one option help the whales die
ren leppens , the rakiura operations manager for the new zealand department of conservation , said in a statement
half the animals were already dead when conservationists arrived , he said
however , its always a heart-breaking decision to make.
refloating whales and dolphins can take many labor-intensive hours , an abundance of trained personnel and , in some cases , special equipment
experts recommend at least one person per animal just to soothe a beached creature even then , its a dangerous undertaking
whale-watchers horrified to witness fishermen harpoon two orcas
with the heart-rending decision to euthanize , the mason bay operation morphed from rescue to cleanup
pilot whales can grow 19 feet long and weigh more than three tons , a massive amount of decaying flesh
and decomposing whales present a unique kind of hazard , as gases build up inside the large mammals , according to national geographic , turning majestic sea creatures into a sudden explosion danger
according to the conservation department
the agency said the restriction would remain in place as officials consider their next step
the stranding was new zealands largest since several hundred pilot whales were found last year in a place called farewell spit many of them were already dead , according to the department of conservation
in that incident , authorities said , hundreds of pilot whales swam into a shallow bay , then got stuck in the waterway , ultimately beaching themselves
it was one of the worst mass beachings in the countrys history , despite desperate attempts to save the animals
photos published by new york times last year showed more than 500 volunteers draping towels over the marine mammals and pouring buckets of seawater on them before they could be refloated
some made it back into the water , but others beached themselves again shortly after , the times reported
more than 400 whales were successfully refloated , the department of conservation said , but as many as 250 died
the most recent mass stranding came a century after the largest reported whale stranding on record , also in new zealand , according to cnn
in 1918 , about 1,000 whales stranded themselves on the chatham islands
since 1840 , there have been more than 5,000 incidents of marine mammal strandings in new zealand , so many that the department of conservation has a special hotline to report them
