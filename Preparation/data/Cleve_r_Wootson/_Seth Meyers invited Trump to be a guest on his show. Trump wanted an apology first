donald trump had remembered that saturday evening in april , particularly the 2 minutes and 34 seconds seth meyers spent skewering him with joke after excoriating joke
it was 2015 four years after the white house correspondents dinner in which trump had become meyerss verbal punching bag and the comic ran into the billionaire at rockefeller center during the saturday night live 40th anniversary special
meyers told politico he seized the moment to make an impromptu pitch trump should come on late night.
they could bill the appearance as a conciliatory meeting four years after the not-so-good-natured ribbing in front of president barack obama and a ballroom full of snickering journalists
trump seemed amenable at the time , but later , meyers told politico , he made an intransigent demand
not a behind-the-scenes handshake , or a contrite text message , meyers told politico , but a public , on-air apology for making fun of trump at the white house correspondents dinner
meyers refused , trump declined , and the appearance never happened
the incident instead became the subject of coffee-table conversation and , perhaps , an insight into the mind of an aggrieved trump
the 2011 white house correspondents dinner may be best known as the day obama got a bit of revenge on trump , one of the loudest voices in the birther movement that claimed the u.s. president was not , in fact , a u.s. citizen
trump was mocked at the 2011 white house correspondents dinner
he insists its not why he ran
but before obama lit into trump , meyers had worked him over , uttering the word trump some 16 times , according to a transcript of the many jokes
cutaways showed a stone-faced , unsmiling trump enduring the fusillade
years later , pundits wondered did that embarrassing night put trump on a beeline trajectory to be the leader of the free world
trump had spoken about running for president as early as 1988 , but many said the night of meyerss speech was a watershed moment
the new yorkers adam gopnik wrote in september 2015 that he was seated a few tables away from trump in 2011
michelle wolfs caustic comedy routine at the white house correspondents dinner , annotated
of course , that pursuit would make him an even bigger target for whoever happened to be headlining the white house correspondents dinner
this year it was michelle wolf , who followed in meyerss footsteps with a caustic diatribe directed at trump
