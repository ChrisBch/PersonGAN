the appointed time for trick-or-treating in galion , ohio , is from 2 to 4 p.m. on the last sunday of october during daylight hours that make it easier for parents and police to keep costumed kids safe
this year , rain fell during that two-hour window in the northern ohio city
afterward , as braylen carwell peeled off his costume and prepared to dive into his haul , he thought his sudden shaking was related to the cold , wet weather
the 5-year-old told cbs affiliate wbns.
and then i couldnt move my arm or my fingers
braylens parents thought it was a seizure
but a urine test revealed the real cause methamphetamine
his father , cambray carwell , told investigating officers that he had taken his children trick-or-treating on the citys west side , according to a police report
when they got home , carwell told police , the children removed their costumes and braylen fell over having a seizure of some sort.
braylen had eaten only a couple of pieces of candy , his father said , but had placed fake vampire teeth into his mouth before he started shaking
carwell said he threw the candy into the trash , and police drove to the fathers house to book the childs halloween haul into evidence
carwell and pence did not immediately return calls from the washington post seeking comment
no one has been arrested in the drugging , and investigators have not identified a suspect , galion police chief brian saterfield told the post
in the united states , for example , the prescription drug desoxyn ( methamphetamine hydrochloride ) has been approved by the food and drug administration for treating obesity and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
police posted a warning on their facebook page , though no other child in galion has turned up with similar symptoms , saterfield said
braylen was hospitalized for seven hours but is expected to make a full recovery

it makes all the difference
the idea that nefarious strangers are sliding tainted candy into the pails of unsuspecting trick-or-treaters is an urban legend that refuses to die
it has roots that date back to halloween deaths decades ago
on oct. 31 , 1974 , ronald clark obryan laced his 8-year-olds pixy stix with cyanide
the boy complained of searing stomach pain , then died on his way to a hospital , the post reported
obryans goal , investigators learned , was collecting $ 20,000 in insurance money
to cover his tracks , he placed the cyanide-laced candy in bags belonging to his own children and those of other kids in the neighborhood
he was executed a decade later , but not before other condemned prisoners gave him a villainous nickname that has endured for more than 40 years the candy man
several years before the pixy stix killing , 5-year-old kevin tostons family said he died after snacking on tainted trick-or-treat candy while staying at his uncles house
authorities later determined that the child had gotten into his uncles poorly hidden stash of heroin , eaten it and died , according to aaron carroll , who has written a book on urban legends
in both instances , the victims were related to the people responsible for their deaths
but national stories about children who died after eating tainted candy transformed halloween inspections from something only paranoid people did into standard parenting 101 behavior
statistically , though , there are bigger dangers for children on halloween , such as an increased likelihood of getting hit by a car , according to the centers for disease control and prevention
still , law enforcement agencies have issued warnings after finding drugs made to look like candy
and as marijuana legalization has spread , law enforcement agencies have warned parents about the dangers of thc-laced candy in halloween bags , although those fears have never materialized , the posts christopher ingraham reported
turning meth into lollipops is usually done to make the drugs more palatable to adults and less risky to transport , bill piper , the senior director of national affairs for the drug policy alliance , told the post last year
saterfield , the galion police chief , said his investigators are keeping an open mind about what happened to braylen
the boys mother told wbns that she and braylens father are recovering drug addicts but that both have been clean for years
she denied that her son could have come into contact with the meth via a family member
im not covering up the truth , she told wbns on monday.
im just speaking the truth of what happened to my son yesterday
nobody in my family or braylens dads family would drug my children
