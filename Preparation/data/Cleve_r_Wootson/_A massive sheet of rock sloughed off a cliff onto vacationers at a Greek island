one moment , tourists were sunning themselves in the sand of shipwreck beach , or taking in the massive rock formation while bobbing in the remote cove in western greece
then there was an almighty cracking sound , in the words of one vacationer , as a section of limestone broke off from the cliffside
the ensuing landslide rained rocks on terrified tourists and caused a large wave that capsized small boats in what is usually a peaceful cove
in all , seven people were injured in the hail of rocks , including a 34-year-old woman from the czech republic who suffered a fractured vertebra , according to the associated press
two of her children and her husband were also treated for minor injuries
the rock face apparently came down in three sections , collapsing in a mound in the cove that is only accessible by boat
youtube daredevils filmed dangerous stunts for clicks then died going over a waterfall
video from the scene showed tourists scurrying to escape the falling rock , then trying to check on briefly trapped loved ones or chasing after overturned boats
josh oconnell , a 21-year-old irish man who works for a tour company , told the newspaper there were more than 400 people in the area and more than a dozen tourist boats
fire department rescue crews scrambled to the beach in boats , bringing a sniffer dog to try to detect anyone who might have been trapped beneath the rubble
a short time later , authorities told the ap , everyone who had arrived at the beach on tourist boats had been accounted for
none of the injuries were life-threatening
for decades , shipwreck beach was best known for the crash of the mv panagiotis , a ship that ran aground off the picturesque coast of zakynthos in the fall of 1980
zakynthos is also featured in the south korean drama descendants of the sun , which prompted savvy travel companies to start tours to the remote island , according to the korea bizwire
on thursday , authorities cordoned off the beach as they worked to determine whether there was any more danger from falling rock
