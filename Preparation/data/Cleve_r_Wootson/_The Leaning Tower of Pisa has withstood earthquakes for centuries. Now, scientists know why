the leaning tower of pisa and its 5.5 degree lean have vexed engineers for centuries
partially constructed on unexpectedly soft soil , the ancient bell tower began to lean before it was even finished , a historical goof that went on to become one of the world 's historical oddities and made the tower a unesco world heritage site
how can something so obviously structurally unsound endure in an earthquake-prone region for hundreds of years
people who assemble an ikea cabinet and have 18 pieces left over do n't expect to pass a wobbly hemnes down to their great-grandchildren
professor george mylonakis wanted to know why
the tower in northwestern italy has managed to survive two world wars , millions of tourist visits and at least four strong earthquakes that have hit the region since 1280 , according to phys.org
one of those quakes was greater than 6.0 magnitude
mylonakis , an engineering professor who studies geotechnics and soil-structure interaction , and more than a dozen researchers came up with an answer that involves that famous soft soil and a jargon-laden term called dynamic soil-structure interaction.
so during a quake , the tower does n't shake as much as the earth beneath it , in further defiance of gravity
mylonakis told the website
the researchers have released only some of their findings
they expect to release the rest this month at the european conference on earthquake engineering in greece
the tower 's insulation from earthquakes does not mean it can metaphorically thumb its nose at nearby , earthquake-ravaged buildings
tilting the tower of pisa
it has continued to settle throughout its history and by the early part of the 20th century , was in real danger of falling
in 1990 , the italian government closed the tower to visitors and began a decade-long restoration project , according to smithsonian magazine
restorers put 900 tons of lead counterweights on the north side of the tower while they came up with a better plan to slow its descent
as the washington post 's jane morley wrote in 1998
the plan involves erecting a stationary a-frame structure on the north side and extending cables from it to a sort of sling or harness around the midsection
this is to hold the structure in place while crews gradually begin to remove small amounts of soil from the high north side
presumably , this will cause that side to subside or sink slightly , rotating the tower back toward the north by about one-half of 1 degree
engineers also installed equipment that allows them to make adjustments to the water pressure beneath the tower , further controlling the tilt
all that construction fixed the tilt a bit to 3.9 degrees from 5.5 degrees while still helping the building maintain its namesake lean
but more importantly , it meant the tower was n't in danger of toppling from the effects of gravity alone
then again , maybe not
