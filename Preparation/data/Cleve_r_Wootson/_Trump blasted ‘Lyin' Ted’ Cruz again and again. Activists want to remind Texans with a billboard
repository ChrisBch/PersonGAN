deep in the heart of texas , a billboard truck will soon hit the road with a curated list of president trump 's tweets attacks on sen. ted cruz , a former political foe
trump popularized the term lyin ted in 2016
but it 's 2018 now , and democratic voter mobilization and an unlikely challenger have mounted an improbable campaign for a reliably republican seat
trump said an october rally is in the works to lend cruz support.
i 'm picking the biggest stadium in texas we can find , trump said friday on twitter
help from the president was long unthinkable in a race that for months looked like a cruz cakewalk , the associated press reported
antonio arellano , a houston-based activist and latino community organizer , thought fellow texans may need a reminder of how trump has suggested they vote when cruz is on the ballot
he was already in the market for a billboard when he tweeted a doctored image carrying a real trump tweet from 2016
why would the people of texas support ted cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them
he is another all talk , no action pol
the tweet read
on the market for a billboard , outside the biggest stadium in texas we can find
his project became more possible , arellano said sunday , with each retweet and suggestion that it could be fully realized
my followers were saying , 'where can i donate
lets make this happen , he told the washington post
he started a gofundme page to fuel the effort , and donations soared
arellano was subsequently joined by david hogg , a former student at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland , fla. , who got involved after catching wind of the image on twitter
political activist claude taylor also joined the effort , and their $ 6,000 goal was met and surpassed within a day , arellano said
the group raised $ 9,760 , then turned away further donations , he said
he hopes to have the truck on the road in the next two weeks
arellano said the actual billboard will be a mobile truck with two sides , and could carry two different tweets at once , one on each side
the route has not yet been planned , but arellano said he is exploring where in the state he should dispatch it with the hashtag trumptweettruck
the cruz campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment
the billboard seeks in part to highlight the contentious history between cruz and trump at a moment when they need each other , although arellano said it mostly criticizes cruz for not challenging trump 's hard-line immigration policies that have affected latinos in texas
cruz 's father is a cuban immigrant
trump is supporting cruz in a tighter-than-expected race to keep a republican majority in the senate
cruz seeks to fend off democratic rep. beto o'rourke , who is riding a wave of national coverage
beto orourke a revolt against trump and a demand for compassion in texas senate race
although he would be the most serious democratic contender to unseat a republican in years , o'rourke 's path to victory would be difficult in the comfortably conservative state
still , a recent nbc news-marist college poll found orourke trailing cruz by just four percentage points in a state trump won by nine , the post 's jenna johnson reported
there are more than a few tweets the truck could highlight
trump has tweeted he doubts cruz 's christian bona fides and attacked the physical appearance of cruz 's wife
in response , cruz called trump a sniveling coward
leave heidi the hell alone.
but cruz now welcomes trump 's support as o'rourke draws in potential voters with a message of unity and compassion in a vitriolic political world , and will often avoid naming cruz and trump directly
trump has trained his twitter salvo on o'rourke , calling him a disaster for texas on friday
that is surely a relief for cruz
the truck may not have new material
but the election is still two months away
