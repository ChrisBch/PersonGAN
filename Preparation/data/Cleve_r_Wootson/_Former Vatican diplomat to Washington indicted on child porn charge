a catholic priest who once was one of the churchs top diplomats in washington was indicted by the vatican on accusations of possessing and sharing a large quantity of child pornography
in a statement obtained by reuters , the vatican said monsignor carlo capella would face a trial starting june 22
he is being held in a cell in the vaticans police barracks
authorities in the united states and canada had been investigating capella for nearly two years
canadian police said the priest allegedly uploaded child porn from a social networking site over the 2016 christmas holiday
in august , the u.s. state department notified the vatican of a possible violation of laws relating to child pornography images , by a diplomat
soon after , the vatican recalled capella , who as a diplomat was one of four staff members who had immunity from prosecution in the united states
the vatican denied u.s. efforts to have capella prosecuted in an american court
the 50-year-olds wide-ranging career in the church brought him to the united states only this past year
born in the town of carpi in northern italy , he was ordained as a priest in 1993 , pursued a degree in canon law and then entered the vaticans corps of diplomats in 2004 , according to the associated press
in that role , he was posted in india and then hong kong before another stint at the vatican
in 2008 , according to a document from the archdiocese of milan , pope benedict xvi conferred the rank of chaplain of his holiness on capella a recognition of service to the church that bestowed on him the title of monsignor
the city-states criminal law says people convicted of possessing child pornography face up to two years in prison and $ 12,000 in fines , and those convicted of producing or distributing the images face steeper penalties
the arrest is another blow for the church , which has faced abuse scandals for decades
the vatican has a zero-tolerance vow on child sexual abuse , but critics have accused pope francis of not doing enough
a week ago , francis met with a group of priests from chile who were reportedly trained in a cultlike community and suffered sexual and psychological abuse , according to the associated press
the el bosque community had been led by the rev
fernando karadima , a powerful preacher in chile who was sentenced by the vatican in 2011 to a lifetime of penance and prayer for having sexually and spiritually abused young parishioners
francis appointed barros to his current diocese in 2015 after the bishop denied all accusations against him
francis later retracted his statement , and last month , all 34 bishops in chile offered to resign after a three-day emergency meeting at the vatican
and on may 31 , francis became the first pope to denounce publicly a culture of abuse and coverup in the catholic church , as the church launched another investigation into the abuses in chile
francis has also created an ambitious reform commission , but one of the two survivors of clergy sexual abuse serving on the body quit in march out of frustration
