and duplantis thinks the light of the world wouldnt exactly settle for 30 inches of legroom or getting patted down by tsa
why would he choose anything less than the falcon 7x , a private jet that nears the sound barrier but also has noise-limiting acoustic technology , a bluetooth-enabled entertainment center and an optional in-flight shower
duplantis , saying he needs about $ 54 million to help him efficiently spread the gospel to as many people as possible , has asked the lord and hundreds of thousands of hopefully deep-pocketed followers across the world for just such a plane
he is the latest aircraft-seeking preacher to draw raised eyebrows and outright condemnation from critics who say asking for a multimillion-dollar luxury jet is not exactly what jesus meant when he said store up for yourself treasures in heaven.
but this is not the first time duplantis has been enmeshed in the preacher private plane debate
the falcon 7x would be his ministrys fourth jet all paid for with cash drummed up from followers
and before anyone asks , he already has an answer for nonbelievers and critics who want to know why , exactly , his ministry requires a luxury jet that would make his fleet the same size as donald trumps
he told people on this week with jesse , a regular video broadcast on his website
the video on may 21 carefully mixed the gospel with a few insights into the economics of international aviation
watch this week with jesse as jesse shows the importance of using aviation as an amazing tool for evangelizing the world
tune in each monday at or on our jdm app
duplantis didnt immediately return calls from the washington post seeking comment
in the video , duplantis didnt specify which ministry-furthering missions the plane would be used for , although he has indicated in the past that he has an extensive travel schedule
duplantis is the founder of jesse duplantis ministries , which includes a weekly television program that reaches 106 million u.s. households , according to his amazon author biography
in 1997 , he and his wife founded covenant church in destrehan , la. , just outside new orleans
the biography says
he preaches the prosperity gospel , which says god shows favor by rewarding the faithful with earthly riches
giving money to pastors and their ministries , leaders say , is a sort of investment
and prosperity gospel preachers have encouraged their flocks to invest heavily in aviation
pastor creflo dollar might get his $ 65 million private jet after all
the campaign was widely ridiculed online , and dollar never made it to the waiting list , which consisted mostly of billionaires
could you imagine if before feeding the multitude w/ 5 loaves and 2 fishes , jesus set up a gofundme account to buy a plane
kenneth copeland , another prosperity gospel adherent who has appeared on-screen with duplantis , announced his ministry had purchased a gulfstream v jet that probably cost millions
the announcement on copelands website showed him wearing a bomber jacket in front of a gleaming white plane
glory to god
its ours
the website said.
the gulfstream v is in our hands
but the ministry needed more , it told followers
the plane was an exceptional value but needed another $ 2.5 million in upgrades
the ministry also needed to build a new hangar , buy special maintenance equipment and lengthen its runway to accommodate the new plane
after making the ask , copeland prayed on camera for god to bless contributors
he and duplantis defended their use of private jets in a widely shared and mocked youtube video
thats why were on that airplane , he said.
we can talk to god.
copeland said he used to travel with faith-healing prosperity preacher oral roberts , who flew commercial , and it got to the place where it was agitating his spirit
people coming up to him
he had become famous
and they wanting him to pray for them and all that
during his request for a new plane , duplantis said he realized some people would remain skeptical
he said there was no obligation , and there was only one surefire way to determine what exactly god wanted them to do pray
because let me tell you something about it , its going to touch people
its going to reach people
its going to save lives one soul at a time
