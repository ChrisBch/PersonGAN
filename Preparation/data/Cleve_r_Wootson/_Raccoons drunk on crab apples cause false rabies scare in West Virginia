rabid animals are , of course , no laughing matter
the rabies virus can infect the central nervous system , resulting in disease and death , according to the centers for disease control and prevention
but that happens after a host of increasingly scary symptoms partial paralysis , agitation , hallucinations , hydrophobia
a british man and two children died in morocco after they were bitten by a rabid cat
so it was not surprising that when people in the city of milton , w.va. , saw raccoons behaving weirdly , they involved the local police
officers staked out the area where the suspect animals were hanging out , looking for any signs of the masked perpetrators
but when they caught two of them , they realized they were dealing with a different kind of issue
the raccoons werent rabid
they were drunk
the raccoons , apparently , had been feasting on crab apples that had fermented on the tree , causing the small animals to walk around staggering and disoriented , police said
turns out they appear to be drunk on crab apples , police said in their official statement to the community
the apprehended animals were held in custody and allowed to sober up in what can only be deemed a raccoon drunk tank
then they were released into the wild , but not before some enterprising officer took a picture of the animal , showing it to be dazed , woozy , more than a little out of it
they named one drunk raccoon dallas and released both near the woods
so , ptl scarberry made his first apprehension today , taking this masked bandit into custody with assistance of sgt ...
and with that , dallas joined a long line of animals that have made headlines for public intoxication
officers in gilbert , minn. , for example , received reports of under-the-influence birds flying into windows , cars and acting confused , police chief ty techar wrote
an early frost meant that berries had fermented before the birds flew south for the winter , according to the washington posts antonia noori farzan , and birds were eating them and getting drunk
residents who thought that perhaps they were in a 21st-century remake of an alfred hitchcock film were amused but also relieved
one person commented on the chiefs post
scientists have identified the 50-foot creature that washed up on an indonesian beach
high animals are more common as more jurisdictions legalize marijuana and people plop the drug into tasty edibles that also appeal to their pets , who cant read warning labels and dont typically have the impulse control to stop at one , brulliard reported
although most of the calls involve dogs chomping on marijuana edibles , brulliard wrote , veterinarians also cited examples of chihuahuas lapping up bong water , cats being exposed to vaping , and even rabbits , ferrets and birds getting accidentally stoned
