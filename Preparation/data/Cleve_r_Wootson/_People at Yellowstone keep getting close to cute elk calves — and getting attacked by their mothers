if the elk of yellowstone national park had a spokeswoman , she would be working overtime trying to set the record straight about elk-human interactions despite the headlines , the average elk has a lot more to fear from the average human
there are , after all , myriad websites with details on how to kill the mostly docile woodland creatures with arrows and guns , strip the muscle from their bones , or purchase literal buckets of their antlers
there are also parts of the internet dedicated to sharing pictures of people posing with elk corpses
but days at yellowstone national park have begun to resemble an episode of when animals attack
twice in three days , cow elk females of the elk species have attacked people at the popular national park , using strong legs and sharp hoofs to send unsuspecting humans to the hospital
the reason for the sudden aggression babies
it is calving season at yellowstone , and elk mothers are fiercely protective of their newborns , as two women learned too late
on sunday , charlene triplett , a 51-year-old who works at the mammoth hot springs hotel on park property , was attacked
the elk was defending a calf that was roughly 20 feet away , hidden behind cars , park rangers say
its unclear whether triplett even saw the calf before she was approached by the elk
the national park service said in a statement monday
tripletts injuries were severe , and she was flown to the trauma center at eastern idaho regional medical center
park rangers meanwhile stayed in the area , warning other unsuspecting visitors about the elk and her calf
no one was cited , but the park warned people to stay 25 yards from the animals
apparently , not everyone got the word in time
rangers said in a news release posted wednesday
the national park service said
park officials said they dont know whether the same elk and the same calf are involved in each case
what is clear is that the elk , while mostly non-aggressive herbivores , are big , powerful and capable of inflicting damage
there are as many as 20,000 elk in yellowstone , which stretches over nearly 3,500 square miles
the animals live in six or seven herds
males can be more than 700 pounds and eight feet long females can be 500 pounds and nearly seven feet long
and a quarter-ton of mother elk can be particularly aggressive in defense of their young , while males can become unpredictable , even hostile , during mating season , instances that make headlines and result in dramatic videos
those and other incidents share common threads
the elk were mostly minding their own business the people got too close
