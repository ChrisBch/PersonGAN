no one is questioning whether leaving the couch to go for a walk or run or to lift heavy objects would personally do you some good accelerating your heart rate , burning some calories , maybe even adding a few years to your life
but consider this all that exercise may be a selfish act , a shortsighted game of checkers in an evolutionary chess match thats been going on for eons
and by not stepping , you may have already taken the first step toward saving the species
finally , there is a study that , if read in just the right way , can lend credence to wasting away a sunday ( or monday or tuesday ) afternoon
think of it as a not-entirely airtight rebuttal to the american heart association , the nfl , to michelle obama and your smartwatchs gentle but judgmental reminder that youve taken only nine steps in the last hour
there is proof in the form of a scientific paper , whose authors may be typing out an angry email to the washington post at this very moment
an article in the journal of proceedings of the royal society b biological sciences this month has found evidence that species that exert less energy on average have a better shot at making another rotation around the circle of life
crossfit-averse people everywhere can send thank-you notes to luke strotz , a postdoctoral researcher at kansas universitys biodiversity institute , who spent years studying the fossils of mollusks and bivalves
his most recent study shows that theres a significant connection between a low basal metabolic rate ( thats the amount of energy an organism expends while at rest ) and a speciess evolutionary endurance
the paper , he told the washington post , gives us more insight into what causes species to go extinct
his co-author , bruce lieberman , an ecology and biology professor , dubbed it survival of the sluggish.
the researchers studied the fossils of bivalves and gastropods in the atlantic ocean
the animals in the study have shells , which have a better chance of weathering the passage of time
and theyve already been heavily scrutinized and catalogued by scientists across north america

strotz and his colleagues compiled a database of some 46,000 specimens from nearly 300 species and found that higher basal metabolic rates were a reliable predictor of extinction likelihood.
the reasons remain a mystery
maybe animals developed a high metabolic rate because they had a high mortality rate and needed to mature quickly and reproduce young before they died from predation , he hypothesized
strotz called this the live fast , die young theory
he said more research is necessary , including on other species
but there are benefits from strotzs study that extend beyond a desire to never know what , exactly , a burpee is
strotz says his research and similar studies can help conservationists understand which animals are the most likely to go extinct because of climate change
there are , of course , caveats one should know about before basing a lifetime of sloth on one tangentially applicable scientific study
full transparency bivalves and gastropods are not human
they are invertebrates that mostly live in the ocean , and in a different section of kingdom animalia altogether
also , netflix has never asked a mollusk are you still watching
and there are other variables in the extinction equation , which can also be influenced by bad luck ( see giant comets , habitat loss and plague )
also , strotz said , hes talking about the average metabolism of a species , not an individual
in the past few days , he has seen articles about his work circulating across the world , along with pictures of slacker stereotypes such as homer simpson and the dude from the big lebowski.
it was not exactly what he was going for when he spent months measuring thousands of mollusk and bivalve shells and pondering extinction
but despite his study being the first thing that comes up when someone googles lazy mollusk , he says hes happy that he has been able to get a lot of sedentary people focused intently on the bigger questions about existence on earth
