authorities removed two nooses and six hate signs found on the grounds of the mississippi state capitol on the eve of a u.s. senate runoff election featuring a black democrat and a white incumbent criticized for pro-confederacy stances and remarks about a public hanging.
state capitol police took down the nooses and the signs and said they are investigating , according to jackson , miss. , nbc affiliate wlbt
authorities have not released images of the signs or surveillance video , which they are reviewing to determine who is responsible
they also havent released details about any suspect
the signs appeared on the same day that president trump was scheduled to campaign in the magnolia state for republican cindy hyde-smith
she was appointed to the senate in march to fill the seat of an ailing thad cochran and was widely expected to win the race to fill the remaining two years of the term in the republican-leaning state
voters will cast ballots on tuesday for the last u.s. senate seat still up for grabs in this election cycle
if hyde-smith wins , republicans would hold 53 seats in the 100-member senate
as the national spotlight pivoted to mississippi , hyde-smith was criticized for a controversial joke in early november about a public hanging in a state with a tragic history of lynching black people
i will be in gulfport and tupelo , mississippi , on monday night doing two rallies for senator hyde-smith , who has a very important election on tuesday
she is an outstanding person who is strong on the border , crime , military , our great vets , healthcare & the 2nd a
needed in d.c
hyde-smith defended the statement as an exaggerated expression of regard , then offered a limited apology during a debate with mike espy , her democratic opponent
and , as the washington posts matt viser reported , hyde-smith has embraced confederate history at several times in her career
in 2014 , she donned a confederate hat , posed with a rifle and told people on her facebook page that confederate president jefferson daviss homestead in biloxi is a must see , viser wrote
in a parade hyde-smith oversaw as state agriculture commissioner , she awarded the best community float prize to a confederate heritage group called dixie alliance
campaign officials for hyde-smith and espy did not immediately return calls seeking comment
the 2018 midterms saw an influx of women and minority candidates , and races for major political offices in the south that featured black candidates have been riddled with similar not-so-subtle racist moments
stacey abrams , a democratic gubernatorial candidate in georgia , was the subject of a racist robo-call that featured a person pretending to be the billionaire media titan oprah winfrey , who had campaigned and knocked on doors for abrams
the robo-call labeled abrams a poor mans aunt jemima , a reference to the black character featured on the front of a popular pancake mix , an image that has itself been derided as a racist symbol
and republican ron desantis , who defeated andrew gillum , the man who sought to be floridas first black governor , told voters shortly after the primary that they couldnt afford to monkey this up.
later , gillum was the subject of a racist robo-call
well , hello there , the call begins , as the sounds of drums and monkeys can be heard in the background , according to the new york times.
i is andrew gillum.
both gillum and abrams lost their races
and now the race in mississippi already increasingly seen as a battle between old south confederate pride and new south principles of racial harmony has an 11th-hour infusion of a potent racial symbol
according to the naacp , between 1882 and 1968 , mississippi had 581 lynchings , the highest number of any state
