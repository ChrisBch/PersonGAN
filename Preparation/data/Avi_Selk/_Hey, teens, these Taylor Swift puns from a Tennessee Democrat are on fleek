a democratic senate candidate in tennessee has posted a humorous message on twitter referencing the lyrics of taylor swift , a singer who is popular with young people and who recently endorsed his campaign
.votemarsha , look what you made her do , senate candidate phil bredesen wrote , addressing his opponent , rep. marsha blackburn ( r ) , by her twitter username
.votemarsha , look what you made her do
taylorswift13 doesnt like your little games and she wants tennesseans to know that youve been in the swamp long enough
its time for some fresh air up in washington
bredesen did not explicitly say so , but look what you made her do is probably a reference to swifts 2017 single look what you made me do.
although the song is not about a senate race , it begins , i dont like your little games which bredesen also echoed in his tweet before segueing into a swamp metaphor unrelated to swifts music
as the reaction on twitter showed , this strategy comes with risks
please hire cool people to write your social media posts instead this is so cringe and i say that as a registered dem
several people who replied to the tweet posted a meme of the actor steve buscemi portraying a high school student a sarcastic reference suggesting that they are skeptical that bredesen is familiar with swifts music
other people liked the tweet , repeating bredesens puns verbatim or posting small icons depicting someone laughing so hard that he or she cries from joy
a betrayal beyond words the far right melts down over taylor swifts endorsement of democrats
taylor swifts endorsement of democrats followed by spike in voter registrations
