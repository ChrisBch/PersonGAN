we knew nearly nothing , except that the secret service had intercepted potential explosive devices targeting the clintons and obamas , while investigators also looked into a suspicious package at cnns new york offices
days earlier , authorities found an explosive device in the mailbox of liberal philanthropist george soros
we did not know who sent them , or why , or what exactly the potential devices were
but john cardillo , a right-wing media personality , was already tweeting out his suspicions
cardillo wasnt alone
bill mitchell , a pro-trump twitter mainstay and radio host , was also convinced that the real target of the potential explosive devices was the political power of republicans
his tweet , which is still live on twitter , has more than 2,000 retweets
online speculation is an inevitable result of a breaking news story on the internet
on wednesday , magabomber was the top trending topic on twitter , propelled by a combination of those assuming the bombs were motivated by trumps rhetoric against democrats and the media and those who were using the hashtag to criticize it
on the pro-trump internet , breaking news speculation has increasingly helped to push the once-fringe idea of politically motivated false flag attacks into the mainstream
later on wednesday , rush limbaugh promoted the false-flag theory , suggesting that a democratic operative was more likely to have sent the devices than a republican.
republicans just dont do this kind of thing , limbaugh said on his radio show.
youve got people trying to harm cnn and obama and hillary and bill clinton and debbie blabbermouth schultz and , you know , just , it might serve a purpose here
the false flag talk spilled over to fox news , as well
while discussing possibilities with martha maccallum on wednesday , former fbi profiler james fitzgerald brought up the false flag.
the republicans
fascinating , maccallum replied
on thursday , donald trump jr. liked a tweet claiming that the devices were fake bombs made to scare and pick up blue sympathy vote
discovery of the devices came just after a big success for the pro-trump internet
ever since trumps inauguration , trumps online base has amplified and fed a meme claiming that violent leftist mobs present a major , immediate threat to the safety of the president and all of his supporters
during the confirmation process for judge brett m. kavanaugh , that meme became the mainstream conservative reaction to protesters who opposed kavanaughs elevation to the supreme court
as our colleagues in politics recently reported , stoking fears of the angry mob of trump opponents has become a key part of the gops strategy to energize their voters for the midterms
an angry mob republicans work to recast democratic protests as out-of-control anarchy
many republican leaders set aside the liberal mob talk to condemn the attacks , including house majority whip steve scalise ( r-la )
and vice president pence
even as some pro-trump media personalities started to walk back their false flag claims , they referred to the liberal mob meme to justify that speculation in the first place
michael flynn jr. , who deleted his tweet calling the situation a total false flag operation , followed up with a series of tweets claiming he was just asking questions , and that the timing of the incident was suspicious.
flynn jr. , the son of michael flynn ( who was briefly trumps national security adviser ) , previously spread the pizzagate conspiracy theory
the left already blaming the gop for this ... .if im wrong about this being a political stunt , ill own up to it.but timing is everything folks
and the timing given how close we are to midterms is highly suspicious
frank gaffney , an anti-muslim conspiracy theorist who has hosted secretary of state mike pompeo on his radio show , also invoked the leftist mob in his own assessment of the news
none of the leftists ostensibly targeted for pipe-bombs were actually at serious risk , since security details would be screening their mail
so lets determine not only who is responsible for these bombs , but whether they were trying to deflect attention from the lefts mobs
i 'll bet money that this is liberal/socialist trying to make gop look bad
no conservative would ever do this
think how many times in past year someone found racist messages and it turned out fake created by liberals looking for sympathy or attention
from the haymarket riot to the unibomber , bombs are a liberal tactic
false-flag theories have probably always been popular among conspiracy theorists , who can attempt to discredit literally any event that proves inconvenient to their worldview
the first viral false-flag theory may have been the 9/11 truther movement , whose devotees spammed out blog posts and suspect documentaries claiming the u.s. government secretly masterminded the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks as a pretext to start the iraq war
( in some versions , cia operatives imploded the world trade center with demolition charges in others , the government used cruise missiles disguised as planes )
algorithms are one reason a conspiracy theory goes viral
another reason might be you
similar theories would occasionally bubble up into the news throughout the 2000s and early 2010s , such as roseanne barrs claims about the boston marathon bombing
but since trumps election in 2016 , false-flag fantasies have become almost as regular as the tragedies they are used to discredit
see , for example
the /pol/ message board on 4chan is a hotbed of conspiratorial delusions even on a slow news day
on wednesday , it was deluged with suspicion
in one of the most popular threads , amateur detectives opined that the envelope sent to cnn did not have sufficient postage stamps for the weight of the pipe bomb it contained , and so must have been built at the cable news headquarters
( the 4channers did not seem to be aware of a new york times report that the bomb was delivered by courier )
another thread fixated on a tweet trump sent in late october 2012 be careful of an obama bomb to win election
its unclear what bomb trump was talking about , but on 4chan , some people took the tweet as proof that he predicted a false flag attack years ago
be careful of an obama bomb to win election
would be a horrible thing to do
