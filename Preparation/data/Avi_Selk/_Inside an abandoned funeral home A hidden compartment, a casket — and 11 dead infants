the horrors inside the old cantrell funeral home had been cleansed in the spring , people thought
state inspectors had walked into the east detroit establishment one day in april and found two bodies grown over with mold , the detroit free press reported
the face of a third was covered with strange fluid
they had been stashed in an unrefrigerated garage for weeks or months , the state alleged
raymond cantrell , who had taken over the business the previous year , told fox 2 detroit that hed been storing the corpses until their families found money to pay for their funerals a favor , as he put it
the state disagreed , and closed the place down
it never reopened
lately , there had been talk of a new owner turning it into a community center , the detroit news reported
neighbors saw work crews coming and going , fixing up the stained floors and chipped walls
and then on friday , the inspectors abruptly came back
they had received an anonymous letter that day , lt. brian bowser told reporters outside the funeral home after detroit police had cordoned it off for the second time since april
the letter contained directions , the homicide lieutenant said
it led the inspectors to a hidden compartment in a lowered ceiling so concealed that bowser was not sure anyone would have found it otherwise
inside the ceiling were a cardboard box and a casket
the casket contained two dead infants
the box held nine more , wrapped in trash bags
theyre very small remains , bowser said
after an anonymous letter was sent to lara friday
the inspectors called 911 , and on friday night police were trying to contact cantrell to ask about the 11 dead babies in what had once been his ceiling to find out if that was another so-called favor to his cash-strapped clients
the homicide lieutenant thought not
he said the medical examiner knew the identities of at least some of the infants and was trying to contact their families
the detroit news reported they appeared to be stillborn
correction an earlier version of this story cited local news reports that incorrectly said construction workers , rather than state inspectors , discovered the infant bodies
