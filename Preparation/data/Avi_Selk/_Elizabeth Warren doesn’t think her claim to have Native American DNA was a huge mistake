sen. elizabeth warren ( d-mass )
warren told members of the boston globe editorial board tuesday , referring to the presidents relentless mockery of a six-year-old accusation that the senator used to identify as a native american at law school in the 1990s
warren released the dna test widely monday suggesting she had at least one indigenous ancestor , most likely in the 19th century along with a folksy campaign video that retold a vague family story about a native american on her mothers side
but a backlash against warren also swelled within hours , led at first by prominent native americans who accused her of attempting to appropriate indigenous ancestry for political points
after too many media inquiries , here is my statement on the elizabethwarren dna testing story
cherokee nation secretary of state chuck hoskin jr. wrote the next day
blackfeet nation member gyasi ross told msnbc that warren was now as guilty as trump of making indigenous ancestry into a campaign prop.
by wednesday , mainstream pundits had overwhelmingly turned against warren

trump promised $ 1 million to charity if warren proved her native american dna
now hes waffling
in the washington post , dana milbank was particularly discouraged that by relying on a dna test not to mention one with such inconclusive results she had accepted a dare trump once made on the campaign trail
for her part , even if her attempt to end the public discussion of her background has had the opposite effect , warren is at least using the opportunity to clarify the remarks that first got her into this mess back in law school
correction an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the dna test suggested warrens genome was as much as 1/64th native american
this was based on a misunderstanding of the results
