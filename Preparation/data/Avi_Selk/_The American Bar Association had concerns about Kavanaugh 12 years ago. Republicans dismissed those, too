history repeated itself
at least it had a spell of deja vu when the american bar association released an extraordinary statement at a crucial moment that raised concerns about judge brett m. kavanaughs nomination to a powerful judicial position just as it had done 12 years earlier
late thursday evening , the aba called for an fbi investigation into sexual assault allegations against kavanaugh before the senate judiciary committee voted on his supreme court nomination
the warning was all the more remarkable , because just hours earlier , kavanaugh and his republican defenders had cited the abas previously glowing endorsement of the nominee the gold standard , as one leading republican put it
flash back to the mid-2000s and another fight in the senate over kavanaughs nomination to a federal court
democrats for three years had been blocking president george w. bushs 2003 nomination of kavanaugh to the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c
they argued he was biased , as shown by his work as a lawyer for bushs presidential campaign , for an independent counsels investigation into president bill clinton and for other conservative causes
republicans kept pushing to make kavanaugh a judge on the powerful appeals court , year after year
in his defense , they cited multiple reviews by the abas judicial review committee that found him well qualified the big attorney associations highest possible endorsement , meaning kavanaugh had outstanding legal abilities and outstanding judicial temperament
analysis kavanaughs evasive testimony probably wouldnt have been allowed in his own courtroom
but in may 2006 , as republicans hoped to finally push kavanaughs nomination across the finish line , the aba downgraded its endorsement
a particular judge had told the aba that kavanaugh had been sanctimonious during an oral argument in court
several lawyers considered him inexperienced , and one said he dissembled in the courtroom
the reviews werent all bad
flake flaked how fox news hosts reacted to the senators call for a delay on kavanaugh vote
in a split vote , it downgraded the rating of the nominee to simply qualified meaning he met the abas standards to become a judge but was not necessarily an outstanding candidate
a day after the aba lowered its rating , the members of the senate judiciary committee called kavanaugh to return and sit before them and argued about how seriously the abas concerns should be taken
some did accuse the aba of bias
other republicans dismissed the warnings and noted the group still found kavanaugh to be qualified overall
sen. lindsey o. graham ( r-s.c. ) asked kavanaugh , who laughed and declined to answer
two days after the hearing , the senate judiciary committee voted to recommend kavanaughs nomination along party lines
the full senate did much the same later that month and so kavanaugh finally became a member of the bench
in his 12 years on the court , he apparently resolved the abas concerns about his temperament
at least one senator didnt watch the kavanaugh hearings because of an emergency appendectomy
but that evening , as republicans prepared to vote on the nomination , and democrats accused them of ignoring multiple womens claims against kavanaugh , the aba once again ran up a surprise red flag
his groups endorsement of kavanaugh notwithstanding , carlson urged the senate to pause the confirmation and have the fbi investigate the claims against kavanaugh before making a decision
twelve years earlier , the groups warnings about kavanaugh had at least delayed his confirmation for the hours it took senators to debate them
on friday morning , judiciary committee chairman charles e. grassley ( r-iowa ) dispensed with the new one in less than a minute
grassley said , as republicans prepared to vote
sen. amy klobuchar ( d-minn. ) told the committee , and then stopped mid sentence as background chatter washed over the room
ill just wait until the staff is done talking over there , klobuchar said , rubbing her eyes
