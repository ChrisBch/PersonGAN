august may have marked the nadir of the trump-era culture wars the month progressives nearly sulked en masse in sheet cake
to recap a woman had just been killed while protesting a massive rally of white nationalists in charlottesville
a black man had been brutally beaten on video at the same event
asked to condemn the rally , president trump equivocated , casting blame on both sides , and thrilling the marchs organizers
trumps chief strategist at the time , stephen k. bannon , reportedly boasted that the president had chosen his people.
white supremacist groups planned follow-up rallies across the country , and one of the movements ideological leaders , richard spencer , would soon lead a celebratory torch-wielding crowd back to charlottesville
those who felt the president had legitimized white nationalism were despondent
and this despair found an avatar in the comedian tina fey , who appeared on saturday night live a week after the rally , wearing a sweatshirt and clutching a sheet cake
she said , answering her own question as she picked up a fork.
and , um , just eat it.
tina fey urges americans stay home from neo-nazi rallies
eat a sheet cake instead
feys advice , briefly , became a sort of viral capitulation strategy
why protest politically ascendant racism when you could sit home and eat a whole cake
the washington post suggested recipes , and an ice cream company tried to market the idea
activists , however , condemned fey and urged americans to resist sheet-cake complacency
back to tina fey
follow the logic of her suggestion down its short path to a conclusion , you 'll find yourself right back where you started
nine months later , history seems to have proved them right
bannon was dismissed from the white house days after the charlottesville rally
protesters shouted down spencers follow-up speeches , and the alt-right leader is begging for money to fight a lawsuit
one of the movements largest organizations dissolved after an inter-family brawl in a trailer in march , and the neo-nazi daily stormer has essentially been kicked off the internet
now fey is back on tv , with a post-mortem on her defunct sheet-cake movement , and she would like to express her regrets
imploding financial troubles
trailer park brawls
has the alt-right peaked
she appeared on the netflix show my next guest needs no introduction this week and largely avoided talking politics with the host , david letterman
but midway through the episode , letterman brought up the snl sketch , of which he was a fan
i thought , this is perfect.
turns out , it was not , sir , fey replied
a clip of the sketch played , including feys final line , in which she sat covered in frosting and urged all prospective protesters dont show up
let these morons scream into the empty air.
long before trumps election , fey had told an interviewer that she would not explain her jokes
now , on letterman , she broke that rule
the cake , she said , did not symbolize capitulation but a refusal to engage with white supremacists on their own terms
and i didnt want any more people to get hurt.
without apologizing for the sketch , fey said she wished she could amend it with a line she thought up days after it aired , as her fans debated whether to resist white nationalism or sit down and eat cake
letterman said he still liked the sketch anyway , and they moved on to other topics
toward the end of the show , fey started to complain about trump again , then stopped herself.
why am i talking about him
in a very dark sketch , snl points out we still dont know how to talk about aziz ansari
trump saying something racist isnt exactly news anymore , snl laments
snl usually avoids parodying tragedy
then trump said hed confront a school shooter unarmed
