frank rzucek told the court as his son-in-law sat behind him clenching and unclenching his jaw , having already pleaded guilty to the murders
three months earlier on aug. 13 , christopher watts at first seemed as much a victim as anyone when his wife and daughters 3 and 4 years old disappeared
he told fox 31 as police searched the house behind him
the illusion held up for a day or so , at least on tv
but investigators were immediately suspicious after finding shananns wallet and keys still in the house
a day after the disappearance , a woman named nichol kessinger contacted the sheriffs office after seeing watts on the news , the denver post reported
she told investigators that she had been dating him for several weeks , under the impression that he was in the process of finalizing a divorce and moving out with his daughters
he lied about everything , kessinger later told the denver post
he said he killed his wife after she strangled their daughters
prosecutors say he killed them all
at mondays hearing , the district attorney alleged that shanann had been trying to save the marriage for weeks texting her husband and buying self-help books as he shopped for jewelry and vacation spots to take his new love.
police arrested watts after interviewing kessinger and soon announced that he had confessed to killing shanann in a rage claiming he had walked in on his wife as she was strangling their two girls , too late to save them
and bit her tongue before she died
watts had been home with the girls while shanann was out of town that weekend
he killed his wife shortly after she returned from the airport early on a monday morning
besides pleading guilty this month to all three murders and unlawful termination of a pregnancy , watts admitted to tampering with their bodies
he dug a hole for shanann and stuffed each of his daughters into a separate tank full of crude oil
bella had to be shoved through the eight-inch hatch , rourke said , leaving a tuft of blond hair on the side that investigators in hazmat suits would later discover
and when he had done all that , rourke said , watts contacted a real estate agent to put the house on the market
cynthia and ronnie watts openly doubted that their son had really done all these things even after he pleaded guilty to it all nov. 6 in a deal that spared him the death penalty
but on monday , as the couple addressed the court and their son , they asked only that watts one day explain himself
watts said only two words at the hearing no , sir , when judge marcelo kopcow asked whether he had anything to say
his in-laws , on the other hand , had much to say to him before he was escorted away to spend the rest of his life in prison
shananns parents had urged prosecutors to spare watts the death penalty , which they do not believe is moral
sandra rzucek said , still holding her composure through the first half of her speech
she lost it as she recalled the title of a song bella sang daddy youre my hero.
rzucek said , sobbing.
i didnt want death for you , because thats not my right
