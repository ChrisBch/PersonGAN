police in northern california say they thwarted a vigilante deportation attempt last week in which a pilot allegedly kidnapped a foreign student , took him to an airport and tried to send him back to china.
jonathan mcconkey , a pilot and certified flight instructor , is accused of orchestrating the kidnapping with his assistant , kelsi hoser , a ground instructor
both reportedly worked at the iasco flight training school in redding , calif
among iascos students were dozens of chinese nationals with student visas , according to court records
krcr news 7 reported that the school contracted with chinas civil aviation authority to train its new pilots , one of whom was apparently tianshu chris shi
shi , 21 , told the record searchlight that he had been in the united states for about seven months living with several other iasco trainees at an apartment in redding
it was there , police said , that mcconkey and hoser came for the student
mcconkey and hoser first showed up at the apartment on thursday night , according to a police statement
shi told the searchlight that they ordered him to pack and be ready to leave for china at daybreak
i said i didnt receive any documents from china , he said
mcconkey and hoser didnt explain why they wanted him out of the country , the student said , and police have not explained either
but shi told the searchlight that he had been forbidden to fly two months earlier , and suspected that his limited english was the problem
an unrelated federal lawsuit , filed last year by a former instructor , alleges that many of iascos chinese students spoke so little english that they could not safely fly that one had nearly crashed into another plane because he had misunderstood his teachers instructions
the instructor was fired after he reported such problems the federal aviation administration , according to the complaint
the lawsuit predates shis training , and does not mention hoser or mcconkey , who is reportedly a 48-year-old manager at the flight school
in any event , police said the two employees returned to shis apartment around dawn on friday
shi had made up his mind by then not to go with mcconkey and hoser , and played an audio recording for the searchlight of what he said transpired

youre going home , with or without your luggage , a mans voice told shi , as transcribed by the newspaper
added a woman whose voice alternated between english and mandarin
the man continued to curse
he threatened to break shis arm , the searchlight wrote , and finally told the student
police said mcconkey battered shi during the argument
the student told the newspaper that the pilot grabbed him roughly by the arm and bent his left side over the kitchen island , which would leave him days later with lingering trauma and pain
hes very rude , shi recalled visibly shaken , the searchlight wrote.
used too much dirty words.
before he was taken from his home , police said , shi managed to call his brother in shanghai and ask for help
his brother tried to call shi back but couldnt reach him
shi was by then being driven several miles to the municipal airport , where the flight school kept its planes
so shis brother phoned redding police , who scrambled to the airport and rescued the student before his accused abductors could put him on a plane
the pairs plan , shi told the searchlight , had been to fly him to the bay area , then put him on another plane to china
mcconkey and hoser were arrested and charged with conspiracy and kidnapping
they were being held on $ 100,000 bail each as of friday , according to krcr news 7 , and could not be immediately reached
the incident has left shi distraught , the searchlight reported , and grappling to convey the trauma in his limited english
but he conveyed gratitude plainly enough
at that moment , police is my jesus , shi told the newspaper
police have not responded to request for more details on the arrests
the searchlight reported that shi plans to hire an attorney , and that at least one other chinese student in the program has accused mcconkey and hoser of attempting to expel him from the country under nearly identical circumstances
in their statement for the two suspects , attorneys john m. runfola and naomi chung accused shi of trying to circumvent american regulations and avoid shame and humiliation at home.
the attorneys said they would soon provide more information about the student and the complexities of training a foreign national post-9/11.
this is a very complicated situation involving multiple agencies , they wrote
