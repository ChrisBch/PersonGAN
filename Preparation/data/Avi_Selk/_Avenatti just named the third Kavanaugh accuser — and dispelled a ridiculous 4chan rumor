a lot of stupid rumors have bubbled up from 4chans anonymous internet forums over the years , wafting through the public consciousness and national news before they inevitably evaporate , leaving reality just a little more polluted
remember the one about the cia supposedly mistaking 4chan fan fiction for a dossier of russian intelligence
or the one where a 4chan regular , qanon , was supposed to be secretly allied with president trump in a war against global evil
all were nonsense
all made the news , regardless
remember the one just tuesday , actually where a 4chan user claimed his stripper girlfriend had tricked attorney michael avenatti into believing she was a 51-year-old woman with a sexual assault accusation against supreme court nominee brett m. kavanaugh
that rumor burned particularly bright and brief
headlines such as newsweeks michael avenatti denies being duped by 4chan user over kavanaugh accuser continued to appear through wednesday morning until the lawyer revealed his client to be julie swetnick and not a fictional stripper running a grift with pepe the frog
it was a rhetorical question
but for the record , here is how , at least , a rumor spread from the bottom dredges of the internet to the peak of the news cycle
i was just forced to make my account private because the bots and trump trolls are out in full force due to my representation re kavanaugh
i will change this back as soon as i am able
even some democrats were suspicious , the daily beast reported
but on 4chans uncensored /pol/ forum , a haven for far-right trolls , the attitude toward avenatti was less suspicious and more downright paranoid
the 4chan site , if youre not familiar with it , is essentially the bathroom wall of the internet
its an anonymous message board where anyone can claim to be anyone and write anything about anyone
many want their message to be widely read to go viral
a small fraction of them are insightful
most are gross and weird
by the forums standards , there was nothing particularly remarkable about what a user identified only as d6yuctxx wrote an hour after kavanaugh locked his twitter account
it was just another post full of obscenities , typos , exclamation points and outlandish claims
the crux of d6yuctxxs story was that some days earlier , he and his stripper gf had called avanatti on their burner cell phones as a prank to pass the time
the girlfriend supposedly convinced avanatti that she had gone to the same school as christine blasey ford who earlier this month accused kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teens , imperiling his supreme court confirmation and had a similar story to share
d6yuctxx wrote that he pretended to be a classmate of judge kavaugh who confirmed the bogus story , and together he and his girlfriend tricked avanatti into offering $ 75,000 if she would tell the story on cnn
totally misreading court records and other ways people are trying to undermine kavanaughs accuser
the pair eventually got tired of the prank and destroyed their burner phones , d6yuctxx wrote , which explained why avenatti had just locked his twitter account after days of hype that hed found a new accuser
it should be noted that not even 4chan readers believed this at first
youve been watching too much breaking bad , wrote one of the first people to reply.
recording or it didnt happen , wrote another
not everyone would be so discerning
10:55 a.m. to 3:42 p.m
like scribblings on the proverbial toilet stall , most posts on 4chan are doomed to obscurity
they pop up on the forums front page , get buried under newer posts seconds later and usually disappear to the bottom of the pile before more than a handful of people see them
d6yuctxxs post was headed for the same trash bin except someone took a screenshot and shared it on twitter , where the claim mated with speculative threads obsessing over who avenattis mystery accuser could be , and , lo , a viral hoax was born
the post trended upward through increasingly popular twitter accounts , mostly on the far right , reaching fox news contributor stephen miller and blogger erick erickson in the early afternoon
those tweets , in turn , became bases for blog posts on conservative sites such as redstate and townhall , which in turn were noticed by reporters
inundated with questions , avenatti explicitly denied the rumor shortly before 4 p.m
naturally , this made the situation exponentially worse
there is a rumor being floated that i was duped or pranked by a 4chan user re kavanaugh
i have received multiple inquiries about it
this is completely false
it never happened it is a total fabrication
none of it is true
the right must be very worried
they should be
4 p.m. to fox news night
in case avenattis blanket statement was not a sufficient denial of a ludicrous theory , cnns jake tapper reported 20 minutes later that he had spoken to the lawyer , who was sticking by his claim that his client was a real person
asked michaelavenatti about the rumor his new client is a hoax it never happened
none of it
no truth to it
this is a fabrication of the right because they are worried and they should be
politico reported in the early evening , soliciting yet another comment from the lawyer like we dont vet clients
give me a break.
before correcting himself a few minutes later
wednesday to the end of time
brian kilmeade defends kavanaugh by circulating yesterday 's 4chan-sourced rumor that 4chan duped michael avenatti
this timeline is so crushingly dumb
the manipulators have found ways to hijack the norms of journalism , phillips said wednesday morning , recounting the spectacle
she recently wrote a paper about how reporters spread fake news even when they try to debunk it , as many did tuesday
she thinks trolls such as d6yuctxx for all their poorly written prose and ridiculous claims probably know this and rely on it
and as hoaxes and conspiracy theories increasingly show up not just in the news but sometimes in the white house , she thinks the trolls are winning
michael avenatti , the adrenaline-fueled lawyer taking on president trump
even if youre leading with the denial , it still puts the story out into the atmosphere
it delegitimizes everything around it
whoever the survivor is , theres going to be a shadow cast on them from now on
at 10:42 a.m. wednesday , avenatti released the name of his client swetnick , who said kavanaugh was present at a party in the 1980s at which she was the victim of a gang rape
kavanaugh denied the allegation , as he has the other accusations
d6yuctxxs stripper-scam story has since disappeared from the news cycle , now being obviously impossible
but back on 4chan , theyre already digging through swetnicks online history , trying hard to start the next one
michael avenatti , the adrenaline-fueled lawyer taking on president trump
jfk jr. didnt die
he runs qanon
and hes no
1 trump fan , omg
a live stream of shia labeouf chanting was disrupted by nazi-themed dancing
then things got weird
