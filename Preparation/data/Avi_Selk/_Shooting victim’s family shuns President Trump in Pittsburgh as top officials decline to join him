pittsburgh a mourning family doesnt want to meet him
leaders of his own party declined to join him
the mayor has explicitly asked him not to come
protesters have mobilized
and yet president trump visited this grief-stricken city tuesday , amid accusations that he and his administration continue to fuel the anti-semitism that inspired saturdays massacre inside a synagogue
the president and first lady melania trump arrived in pittsburgh on tuesday afternoon , not long after the first funerals began for the 11 victims of the mass shooting at tree of life synagogue
more than 1,300 people have signed up for a demonstration at the same time declaring trump unwelcome in our city and in our country.
( mcconnells office said the kentucky senator has events in the state and was unable to attend.
so have relatives of at least one of the victims
trump offered to visit with the family of daniel stein , a 71-year-old who had just become a grandfather when he was gunned down at tree of life
steins nephew , stephen halle , said the family declined in part because of the comments trump made in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , when he suggested the synagogue should have had an armed guard
everybody feels that they were inappropriate , halle said tuesday.
he was blaming the community
steins funeral was one of four scheduled for tuesday
in the late morning , hundreds of mourners lined up to see the coffins of cecil and david rosenthal two brothers gunned down at tree of life three days earlier , as they celebrated the jewish sabbath with stein and the other victims
im dr. cohen the powerful humanity of the jewish hospital staff that treated robert bowers
the citys democratic mayor , bill peduto , had asked the white house to consider the will of the families before visiting as well as the resources of a city straining under the deadliest attack on jews in u.s. history
all attention should be on the victims , peduto said monday.
we do not have enough public safety officials to provide enough protection at the funerals and ... at the same time draw attention to a potential presidential visit
after trump confirmed his visit anyway , the mayors office said peduto would not appear with the president
neither will allegheny county executive rich fitzgerald , who lives near the synagogue , his office said
trump visited the tree of life synagogue on tuesday , according to the white house pool report , going inside with his daughter ivanka trump and his son-in-law jared kushner , both of whom are jewish and serve as top white house aides
news cameras then captured trump and the first lady outside the synagogue , placing flowers and stones at memorials to the victims
he then went to a hospital to visit some of the wounded , a pool report said
the white house said trump met with doctors and members of law enforcement at the hospital tuesday , and spent about an hour with the widow of richard gottfried
sarah huckabee sanders , the white house press secretary , told reporters aboard air force one
gottfried , 65 , and his wife , peg durachko , had just celebrated their 38th wedding anniversary and were planning to retire soon
sanders said that the president came to pittsburgh in the face of opposition because some had wanted him there
the president wanted to show his respect on behalf of the entire country , and to represent the country in this moment and be there to show our support , she said
about an hour before trump arrived in the area , more than 100 people had jammed onto a street corner in squirrel hill , the predominantly jewish neighborhood where the synagogue is located and many victims lived
the number swelled as trumps visit neared , with some marching through the neighborhood streets and declaring themselves angry that he would come to their community
this did n't happen in a vacuum , ardon shorr said
there is a growing trend of white nationalism
and that has been enabled by trump , who traffics in the kind of conspiracy theories that we know were foremost in the mind of the shooter last saturday
shorr added about trumps visit.
hes not tolerated here , and we didnt consent to him coming.
others gathered to protest echoed schorrs sentiments in criticizing trump and questioning his visit
marchers in squirrel hill sat down in the middle of a street near the synagogue while trump was in the area , purposely facing away from him so as to turn their backs on the president
as trump left washington for pittsburgh , kara bernstein was on her way to protests in squirrel hill
bernstein , who lives near tree of life and was at another house of worship during saturdays massacre , went with two friends in part to urge people to vote
her second motivation , she emphasized , was speaking out against trump
she believes his visit is a distraction from the grieving.
tree of life has been closed since saturdays rampage , which was allegedly carried out by a man who had ranted online that jews were bringing invaders in that kill our people.
the suspect , robert bowers , was referring to a jewish group that works with refugees in the united states
trump has repeatedly referred to migrants as dangerous invaders , and did so again in a tweet on monday
the president has also repeatedly denigrated globalists despite warnings from jewish groups that the word is code for jews in anti-semitic circles , and appeared in one of bowerss online rants
trumps supporters , however , paint him as a friend to jews , pointing out his jewish daughter and son-in-law as well as his support for the israeli government and his condemnations of evil anti-semitism after the attack
funerals are scheduled to run at least through friday
trump played happy at an event after the pittsburgh massacre
now pharrell wants to sue him
the letter reads
abraham foxman , a holocaust survivor who led the anti-defamation league for nearly 30 years , made the same argument to reach the opposite conclusion from the letter signers
trump also has been criticized for repeatedly suggesting that arming more people will stop mass shootings
he made the same suggestion after the attack on the synagogue , even though the gunman shot three police officers before he was captured , and armed officers have been present at multiple rampages in recent years
the white house woke up to yet another furor on tuesday morning
honoring pittsburgh synagogue victims , mike pence appears with rabbi who preaches , jesus is the messiah
a 46-year-old truck driver who gave his neighbors no hint of the bigotry he spewed online , bowers arrived in federal court monday in a wheelchair , still recovering from injuries he suffered in a shootout with police at the synagogue
all throughout his rampage , his capture , and his care in the emergency room at allegheny general hospital , where some of the doctors and nurses who treated him were jewish , bowers allegedly ranted about wanting to kill jews
but he said almost nothing from his wheelchair in the courthouse
magistrate judge robert c. mitchell read the charges , including obstruction of exercise of religious belief resulting in death , for which he might face the death penalty
dressed in a sweatshirt and sweatpants , he was asked if he wanted a public defender because he could not afford an attorney , and said yes.
he remains held without bail
bowers faced both state and federal charges
local prosecutors sought to have bowers be arraigned on the state charges , but federal authorities declined that , according to the office of stephen a. zappala jr. , the allegheny county district attorney
federal investigators have concluded that bowers legally acquired and possessed all of the guns recovered from the tree of life synagogue and his home , the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives said tuesday
