the big banana-shaped sofa on the set of fox & friends has almost always been a safe space for president trump
its where steve doocy once told trump he was glad they were friends , and where brian kilmeade remarked that trump looked very big on tv
its the couch where ainsley earhardt sat one morning last year and reminded people that trump is the boss after he fired the fbi director and upset many people who were not co-hosts of trumps favorite morning show
but on wednesday , assuming trump was watching fox & friends as he so often does , he would have heard a rare public scolding from the couch
last night , he chose to blow it , kilmeade said as doocy and earhardt looked at him with silent concern
kilmeade meant a political rally trump spoke at the previous evening , amid the latest public crisis to engulf his administration sexual assault accusations against the presidents supreme court nominee , brett m. kavanaugh
the crowd laughed
but the next morning , even republican senators who have supported kavanaughs nomination condemned trumps comedy bit
and in a rarity , kilmeade joined them even if he wrapped his criticism in several layers of support for the president and his nominee
andrew napolitano , the fox news analyst who doesnt blindly defend kavanaugh
he said of fords allegation.
is that enough to destroy someones career , life and reputation
a note about kilmeade he is arguably the most rebellious of the fox & friends co-hosts , not that its a particularly high bar
in a los angeles times report one of many that have described the presidents love of the show and the co-hosts reciprocal fondness for the president kilmeade argued that he has taken trump to task many times
the times wrote , for example
another when trump complained on twitter this summer about many years of u.s. foolishness and stupidity , kilmeade made an issue of it on the show
the horror of president trumps dependence on fox & friends
a month later , in august , kilmeade lamented that former white house aide omarosa manigault newman had outsmarted the president by writing a tell-all book about his chaotic administration
trump has taken the bait and gone out and directly tweeted at her , kilmeade said , worrying that attacking newman would only help sell more copies of her book
was foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news
you deserve it - three great people
the many fake news hate shows should study your formula for success
but kilmeade rarely presses such criticisms , and they are vastly outnumbered by the times he has defended the president or praised him
witness what happened on the show immediately after he called out trumps public mockery of ford
well , there were holes in her story , earhardt told kilmeade , seated beside him on the big sofa
doocy agreed with her
when the camera cut back to kilmeade , he maintained that sexual assault is deadly serious.
but , he added , many of the other accusations endangering kavanaughs nomination amounted to college kids acting like many college kids.
fox & friends then moved on from the topic entirely
a few minutes later , kilmeade was talking about how easy it would be for trump to win reelection
hes going to have a very strong report card , he said
fox news anchor says kavanaugh case prompted his own daughters to reveal their stories
little lies point to bigger lies how james comey thinks the fbi could investigate kavanaugh
the american bar association had concerns about kavanaugh 12 years ago
republicans dismissed those , too
