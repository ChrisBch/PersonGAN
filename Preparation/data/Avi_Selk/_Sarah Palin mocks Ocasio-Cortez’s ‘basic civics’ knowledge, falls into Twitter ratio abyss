today in basic twitter lessons the ratio
a ratio is what happens when a tweets endorsements as measured in retweets and likes are vastly outnumbered by criticism in the form of replies
also , a ratio is what happens when sarah palin tries to mock someone else for botching an interview
yikes ocasio-cortez fumbles basic civics twice in 1 statement
belittling the far-left , 29-year-old congresswoman-elect has lately become something of a popular sport on the right-wing internet
yikes , wrote palin , or whoever controls her social media accounts , and almost instantly earned herself a pretty bad 2-to-1 twitter ratio
if its not immediately clear why , its easy to demonstrate
alexandria ocasio-cortez wore clothing , a journalist tweeted a photo , and the internet pounced
for every approving retweet from a perryhammons and an angiemardesich , who told ocasio-cortez , your not smart enough to answer our questions , there was ( clears throat )
referring to a saturday night live parody of her first national interview in 2008 , when abc news host charlie gibson asked about her foreign policy insights , and she replied you can actually see russia from land here in alaska
does not write notes on hands8
the founding fathers said the pledge of allegiance9
does not think afghanistan is a neighboring country of the us10
does not think drinking diet dr. pepper is the ice bucket challenge 11
so it went , the ratio holding fast as the raw quantity of tweets ballooned on either side of a dividing line
by wednesday morning , some 6,100 retweets and likes from self-described trump nationalists and patriot rednecks were eclipsed by more than 16,000 replies
and , down near the bottom of the reply thread , sybilleabeds favorite example the radio interview palin gave two years after she lost the election , when she spoke of our north korean allies
i remember my husband and i hearing it on our car radio at the time she said it and just bursting out laughing
and its true , to be fair , that palin corrected herself seconds later in that last interview
but so did ocasio-cortez
as the ratio consumed palins critical tweet , ocasio-cortez clapped back
now thats *two* fallen gop vice pres candidates going after a freshman congresswoman thats not even sworn in yet
