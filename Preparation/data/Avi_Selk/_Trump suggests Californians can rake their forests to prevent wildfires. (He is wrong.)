the white house has not responded to a request for clarification on what trump meant by raking , so the above possibilities can not be totally discounted
however , its worth pointing out that when the president spoke of watching firemen rake beneath a little nut tree , he moved his hands back and forth as if he were miming a garden rake
reversing course on his threat to cut the states federal funding if californians dont solve their forest fire problem , president trump now says hell solve it with them
how to make californias vast drought-stricken forests safe after the camp fire grew to the size of chicago this month , killing dozens if not hundreds of people and burning an entire town to the ground
trump promised federal funds and says he has some ideas
one of those ideas is raking
its not a popular idea
you got ta take care of the floors
you know the floors of the forest , very important
i was with the president of finland , he called it a forest nation , and they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things and they do n't have any problem
trump told reporters as he posed with california officials in the charred ruins of paradise his first stop on the tour
graphic mapping the camp and woolsey fires in california
trump went on to explain that the president of finland , whom he met on an overseas trip a week earlier , told him about raking the forest floors.
he called it a forest nation , trump said , and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things , and they dont have any problem
finnish president sauli niinisto later disputed this
he told a local newspaper that he had briefed trump on finlands efforts to surveil and care for its forests , the associated press wrote , but said he cant recall anything being mentioned on raking.
and the fins , ever faithful allies , step up to the plate
maybe it wasnt niinisto who gave trump the raking idea
maybe it was something he saw on tv
that should have been all raked out , he concluded.
you wouldnt have the fires.
the fox host , chris wallace , asked whether climate change might not be a larger wildfire factor than unraked debris , but trump didnt think so
wherever trump got the notion that raking parts of california be it entire forest floors or the areas around little nut trees could have prevented the camp fire , not many people seem to agree
the online reaction in finland alternated between those pointing out that the country has a vastly different climate and population density and those making jokes
every finnish home has got a print of this cautionary painting called raking and cleaning fail
the ideas domestic reception wasnt much better
he suggested california should rake and clean its forests to prevent wildfires
early look at sunday 's front page ...
this is not to say that raking has nothing to do with fire prevention even if its not the exotic and comprehensive solution trump made it sound like
raking is an effective way to clear light debris like leaves and pine needles away from residences , she said
its of much less use on the forest floor , where infernos burn through swaths of brush and large debris that only heavy machinery can clear
californias problems are complicated , she said a combination of hot , dry climates , poor community design and 100 years of fire suppression that helped turn forests into tinder boxes
like trump , valachovic said the problem is solvable but through long-term programs of community education , controlled burns , forest thinning and economic incentives
much more than rakes , in other words
