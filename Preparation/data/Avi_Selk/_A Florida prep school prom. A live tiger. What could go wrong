the proms advertised theme was welcome to the jungle , and staff at christopher columbus high school went to some effort to fulfill this promise of the wild
not that the all-male catholic prep school waived its standards of etiquette for the big night on friday
the boys about 400 were due to graduate this year were told to arrive at the doubletree by hilton miami airport & convention center in jackets and ties , clean-shaven , sober and unpierced
their dates , too , showed up looking as proper as befits such a milestone
the prom had been decorated like a real , wild safari camp or at least some hollywood approximation thereof , with faux-rock walls and fake snakes and trees along the main wall
other decorations were real
a live lemur and macaw were incorporated into the spectacle to serve as props for the students take-home photos
boys and girls passed around a tiny african fennec fox like a corsage though the fox hung rather limply in photos that have since been deleted from a school instagram account
christopher columbuss student activity committee has also vanished pictures of prom nights wildest surprise a live tiger to entertain the students , for which the principal has since apologized
the extraordinary life and death of the worlds oldest known spider
the tiger was wheeled through the double-doors midway through the event , in a cage not much larger than its massive frame , accompanied by spotlights and the thud of drums
oh my god
oh my god
a young man shouted in student videos of the tigers presentation
oh my god , said woman at a table near the front.
its so beautiful.
the animal paced in tight circles as the students gawked , seeing nothing in any direction except metal bars and a sea of delighted faces
as the drumming quickened , two performers walked out into the space between the cage and the crowd
they were dressed in patterned bodysuits vaguely resembling the tigers stripes , and both held lit torches in their hands
its super scared , someone in the crowd observed as the dancers juggled flames before the tiger
as the show went on , the tiger eventually stopped circling and curled up in a corner of the cage , facing away from the fire dancers and the bulk of the crowd
in a statement to reporters , the school would later call this a relaxed state though the animals emotions are less clear in student video footage
the tiger lay still as the dancers flung torches a few feet away
it stared at the fake rock backdrop and the wall-mounted tvs that looped video of real grasslands
it could not escape the light show
where there was not fire , geysers of sparklers exploded on every side of the tiger , drawing applause from the boys and their dates
like many students , mari-cris castellanoss younger brother had not minded the performance , the 19-year-old college student told the washington post
he had paid $ 200 to attend the prom , she said , and thought the tiger was having fun.
castellanos said , she forwarded the footage on to the media and the general public and called for a ban on animal entertainment inside schools

johanna garcia hernandez wrote on the schools facebook page
christopher columbus defended the tiger show at first
images of the caged animal and celebratory teens kept spreading throughout the weekend eventually becoming international news
the farther from the hilton the images traveled , the more criticism fell on them
ron magill , a spokesman for zoo miami , eventually watched the videos and told reporters castellanos was correct the animal appeared distressed
on sunday , the school backed off its defense of the prom and released a second statement
principal david pugh wrote
we all have learned a great deal from this experience.
the school did not respond to questions asking which company provided the prom animals and how administrators decided on the jungle theme
