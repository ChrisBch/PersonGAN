detroit police chief james craig announced a wide probe into michigan funeral homes friday , after hidden caches of baby corpses were allegedly discovered at two unrelated businesses inside a week
the raid came a week after an anonymous letter led investigators to an abandoned funeral home on the other side of central detroit , where they allegedly found nearly a dozen infant corpses hidden in a ceiling
craig told reporters , shortly after leaving a meeting with fbi and state investigators.
this is much larger than we might know.
the police chief gave few details about the investigation , and declined to speculate as to what would motivate someone to keep tiny desiccated corpses long after they were supposed to have been interred
all the same , he described how the case escalated rapidly from a single anonymous tip into a full-blown investigative task force that could now probe businesses throughout the state
the case began last week at cantrell funeral home in east detroit , which had been shuttered since the spring over accusations that adult corpses had been improperly stored to the point of growing mold
an unsigned letter received on oct. 12 urged investigators to return to the business and search it
the note led them to what police described as a hidden compartment in a ceiling containing a casket , cardboard boxes , several trash bags and the remains of 11 dead infants
inside an abandoned funeral home a hidden compartment , a casket and 11 dead infants
nevertheless , police opened a criminal investigation into the matter this week
investigators then got a second tip , leading them to a second funeral home
the detroit news wrote that the tipsters were the parents of alayah davis , who died of respiratory failure minutes after she was born in late 2014
the mother and father sued perry funeral home in july , alleging that the company had claimed to bury alayah at a particular cemetery but had actually stored the body for years in a mortuary school morgue
the company was accused in the lawsuit of hoarding other dead infants , the news reported , including some whose parents wanted the corpses donated for medical research
perry went so far as to issue fraudulent death certificates for the infants , the lawsuit alleged , and billed medicaid and hospitals for funerals that were never performed
a lawyer for the funeral home , joshua i. arnkoff , wrote in a news release late saturday
he said the funeral home obtained the corpses from local hospitals that had been unable to contact the parents to claim them
the attorney wrote , and therefore had no choice but to hold onto them
the washington post could not independently review the lawsuit , but craig , the police chief , said the allegations led them to raid perry funeral home
perry funeral home had its license revoked immediately after the raid
it is now shuttered like cantrell before it
while a criminal investigation is underway , no one has been reported arrested in either case
