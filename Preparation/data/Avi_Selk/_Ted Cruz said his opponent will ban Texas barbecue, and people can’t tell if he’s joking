demonstrators with the people for the ethical treatment of animals crashed a sen. ted cruz campaign event on saturday , handing out barbecued tofu outside a restaurant in columbus , tex
ive got to say , they summed up the entire election , cruz told the crowd inside the restaurant
if texas elects a democrat , theyre going to ban barbecue across the state
oh , he wasnt done
you want to talk about an issue to mobilize the people , and im talking everybody , cruz continued , as reported by the austin-american statesman
the crowd inside the restaurant laughed
cruz had been smiling as he spoke , the statesman wrote but just because cruz is smiling doesnt mean hes just kidding around
liberals desperately want to turn texas blue , cruz said
they want us to be just like california , right down to tofu and silicon and dyed hair
he was smiling , but also shouting , and had given the example as an example of the far lefts dangerous ... level of fury and rage
anyway , the peta members who showed up on saturday werent there on behalf of orourke or any democrats
in the words of their news release , they just wanted to show cruz how delicious tofu can be
a day after his campaign stop , cruz made another beto/barbecue joke
.peta protested our town hall yesterday , handing out barbecued tofu
we were glad to welcome them , but it illustrates the stakes af the election if beto wins , bbq will be illegal
his spokeswoman made another one , coining the hashtagabolishbbq , which did not go viral
then she just started tweeting about barbecue a lot
cruz kept it up , retweeting other peoples jokes and articles about his own joke
the campaigns barbecue fun lasted into monday , by which time not everyone in the national audience was laughing
the statesman remembered that one of the last times cruz mixed politics and humor , his campaign aired a radio jingle that falsely accused orourke of hiding his real name
a furor over the ad eventually led cruz into a contentious cnn interview where he explained , it is just kind of a sense of humor
rafael ted cruz accuses his democratic opponent of changing his name to appeal to voters
likewise , a statesman reporter suspected that joking or not , cruz may have been trying to associate orourke with an untexan , pro-tofu , weirdo vegan , animus toward bbq in the minds of his audience
whatever humor cruz intended was lost in many of the news headlines
searching for new wedge issue , cruz says orourke will ban barbecue , was the statesmans
newsweek ted cruz claims beto orourke will ban barbecue in texas
esquire ted cruz has nothing left but culture war gibberish
and a good portion of twitter was just confused
cruz 's desperation is pathetic.he actually claimed that beto wants to ban bbq
i thought this was a joke until i looked it up.what 's his next desperate lie to appeal to ted 's caricature of a texan
that beto wants to ban armadillos , pickups and cowboy boots betoforsenate
cruz wants to ban bbq in texas
that 's his big platform
he is cozying up to the man who called his wife ugly
does n't stand up for his wife , and sure does n't work for tx until he realized he was in big trouble
he used three laughing emojis after the tweet , spokeswoman catherine frazier wrote back
of course it was a joke
