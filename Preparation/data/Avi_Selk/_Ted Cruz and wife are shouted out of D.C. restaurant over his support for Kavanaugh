heidi cruz stood frozen in the middle of the restaurant , hands clenched beneath her shawl , teeth bared in what might have started as a grin before it changed to something else
sen. ted cruz ( r-tex )
had not yet removed his overcoat
he and his wife had not yet reached their table , which sat set and ready for them just a few paces away a cream-cushioned booth , as reserved
but the cruzes had not ordered all this chanting
we believe survivors
we believe survivors , sang the crowd that had materialized around the couple
there were perhaps a dozen of them
a moment earlier , they had been any other patrons at fiola , a $ 145 set-price italian restaurant a mile from the u.s. senate building
now they were a monday night flash mob with cellphone cameras
sexual assault survivor questioned cruz during disruption at fancy washington dc restaurant
cruz ignores her
hiiiiii
said a woman behind one of the cameras , stretching the syllable.
id love to talk to you about brett kavanaugh tonight.
the woman was addressing the senator , not his wife the two men are known to be old friends
more pertinent , ted cruz is a republican on the senates judiciary committee , and kavanaugh is a supreme court nominee whose confirmation process has been interrupted by allegations that he sexually assaulted one woman and engaged in sexual misconduct with another as a teenager
lawyer michael avenatti has said he represents a third woman , but she has not yet come forward
the chanting never stopped.
we believe survivors
organizers of this protest would later identify themselves as members of various left-wing organizations a local anti-fascist group and a branch of the democratic socialists of america , among others
several said they were sexual assault survivors
they told the post they had been tipped off to the cruzes reservation that evening and sat covertly at fiolas bar for more than an hour to await his arrival
ted cruz didnt want to talk about kavanaugh with a dozen strangers in the middle of a restaurant
heidi cruz eventually unfroze and slid into the booth
the camera frame suddenly jostled.
please dont touch me , the woman said
bookstore owner defends calling police on woman who told steve bannon he was a piece of trash
trabocchi was aware that flash protests such as this have beset the hospitality industry for months trumps press secretary , sarah huckabee sanders , was refused a table at a tiny restaurant in rural virginia florida gov
rick scott ( r ) was chased out of a cuban place last week
the possibility is a risk almost anywhere a prominent republican shows up to eat
trabocchi had nevertheless hoped that her restaurant was exempt
politicians from both parties come into fiola all the time , trabocchi said.
everyone except donald trump
were very bipartisan by nature.
that made no difference monday , of course
fiola may be bipartisan , but the country isnt
the woman said , now encompassed by the chanting throng
cruz looked straight into the camera and smiled.
god bless you , maam , he said , and took his coat off and sat down very briefly
cruz is one of 21 members of the judiciary committee expected to question kavanaugh when he returns to the senate on thursday to defend himself against his accusers , one of whom is also scheduled to testify.
these allegations are serious and deserve to be treated with respect , cruz said in a statement last week , a few days before a second woman went public with accusations against the nominee
but cruz also faces a tough reelection fight in texas against democrat beto orourke
and kavanaughs nomination is historically unpopular with the public , and its uncertain how long his support among republican senators will hold
cruz did not respond to his interrogators at fiola , except to offer pleasantries wildly out of sync with the shouts and screams around him
we would like to leave in private , he said as he stood up from the table.
beto looks way hotter than you do
another raised a middle finger as the couple shuffled past
orourke condemned the protest the next morning
not right that senator cruz and his wife heidi were surrounded and forced to leave a restaurant last night because of protesters
the cruz family should be treated with respect
god bless , cruz told the crowd again.
can you let my wife through
questions followed them , mostly indistinguishable beneath the chants
white-jacketed staff remained standing , motionless , as the cruzes were slowly pursued to the door
a manager had already called the police by then , trabocchi told the post
other than that , all they could do was hope the scene did not turn violent
when the cruzes reached the door , a waiter tried to open it
the door stuck , so he pushed again
then again , and again , and harder each time
we believe survivors
a dozen voices screamed in unison
fascist , racist , anti-gay
another called him a piece of filth.
lacy macauley held a camera recording all of this , and at no point was she moved by arguments that the cruzes deserved to eat their meals in peace
finally , the waiters got the door open , then slammed it shut again as soon as the cruzes had walked out into the night
the crowd inside whooped
this is whatll happen to you if you support kavanaugh
a man warned the other patrons as they passed back through the bar
leave the premises , a staff member told them.
this is a private space.
the intruders had left by the time the police arrived , trabocchi said
the cruzes were long gone
someone from trabocchis restaurant phoned the senators office tuesday morning , she said
she did not reveal what was discussed but said the senator is welcome back anytime , although she does not know how she can prevent another ambush
those who planned it appear to have achieved their purpose
videos of the encounter were published on the smash racism dc social media accounts in the middle of the night , along with a statement that the group said would be its only comment on the incident
