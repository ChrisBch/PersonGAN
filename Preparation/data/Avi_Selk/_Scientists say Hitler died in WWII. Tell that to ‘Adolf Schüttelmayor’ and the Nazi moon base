the study was no easy feat
over the past 73 years , hitlers presumed corpse has been set on fire , secretly buried , dug up by the soviets , hidden by the kgb and finally ordered destroyed
hitlers person , meanwhile , has appeared in the fantasies of all manner of conspiracy theorists who insist his body is a fake
so last year , a team of french researchers persuaded the russian government to let them inspect the last two bits of hitler known to exist a bullet-shot chunk of skull and a set of frankly disgusting teeth
they compared these fragments to war-era autopsy records and concluded that , yep , those are definitely hitlers teeth
co-author philippe charlier told agence france-presse after the paper was published friday in the european journal of internal medicine
the professor is by no means the first researcher to try to debunk claims that hitler survived world war ii , which have persisted for decades despite the derision of nearly all mainstream historians
but just in case charlier is right and his study really does mark the end of hitler survival fiction , we have memorialized the genre for the sake of posterity
we present below the many lives and deaths of adolf hitler , in descending order of plausibility
hitler died heroically in battle
actually , charliers team concluded , hitler most probably died with his wife while hiding in his berlin bunker , quite possibly after swallowing a cyanide pill and then shooting himself in the head for good measure
in this , the study confirmed what has long been the official account of his death
maybe one reason that so many people have had trouble accepting the official version of hitlers demise is that it started out as a baldfaced lie
its the 50th anniversary of the day trump left college and ( briefly ) faced the draft
at 10:20 p.m. on the day after hitlers suicide , a german admiral addressed the country by radio
he announced somberly that hitler had died a few hours earlier , fighting at the head of his troops.
he told a court.
it was no use to do anything.
inevitably , the notion of hitler the war hero was shown to be a hastily conceived fraud , but the nazis and their conquerors didnt exactly make it easy for the public to learn the truth
as charlier and his co-authors wrote in their paper last week , hitler had demanded in his will that the soviet forces about to overrun berlin not be allowed to defile his corpse
accordingly , his lieutenants doused his body in benzine , lighted it on fire and buried it in a nearby shell crater
of course the occupying soviets found the body anyway , autopsied hitler and concluded that he had killed himself in a suitably cowardly fashion
as explained in the death of hitler , the russians found it politically useful to keep the world guessing about hitlers fate
to sow chaos , we might say today
and the strategy worked
there was mass public confusion about when , how and whether hitler had died
so rampant was the disinformation that even gen. dwight d. eisenhower entertained the possibility of hitlers survival
d-days heavy toll on dwight d. eisenhower
hitlers great submarine escape
in loving detail and with minimal disclaimers , the daily mail once recounted one of the more elaborate legends of hitlers escape from allied-conquered europe , beginning with the besieged leader contemplating his future staring at a portrait of frederick the great
hitler thought , the mail wrote.
that left one option escape.
so three days before his purported suicide , hitler ordered two corpses to be dressed as himself and his wife
he waited until the stroke of midnight , then slipped out of his bunker via a secret tunnel and sneaked through the bombed-out city of berlin
he rendezvoused with an airplane he had arranged to meet him on an abandoned thoroughfare , then flew to denmark and then spain , then commandeered a submarine and escaped to south america , where he lived out his days in peace
indeed , the newspaper wrote , hitlers supposed escape by submarine has inspired so many pseudo-historical books about his latter days that rival authors occasionally accuse one another of plagiarism
the tropical adventures of adolf schttelmayor and friends
like all the best conspiracy theories , the story of hitlers retirement in south america intersects with just enough reality to make it vaguely plausible , without being so tied down to facts that it risks being disproved
a nazi u-boat really did disappear near the end of world war ii , for example
and many high-ranking nazis really did escape to the americas , sometimes evading capture for years
last year , a newly declassified cache of government documents revealed that the cia actually investigated a report that hitler was among them
a fairly reliable source contacted the agencys base in venezuela in 1955 , according to a cia memo , and shared a photograph of two men taken in colombia the previous year
the clean-shaven man on the left was a former german ss trooper , according to the source
and the man on the right was supposed to be hitler
he had apparently changed his name to adolf schttelmayor but was not so worried about discovery that he felt it necessary to shave his mustache
hitlers alleged presence in colombia was an open secret in some circles , a subsequent cia investigation found
in a city overly populated with former german nazis , the former ss officer told an agency source , schttelmayor was idolized by those who knew his real identity
they called him der fhrer and honored him with the old nazi salutes
so schttelmayor , whoever he was , was thereafter left alone
of course , by the time the cia memos were made public last year , various writers had spun far more elaborate stories about hitlers alleged life in south america
the extraordinary life and death of the worlds oldest known spider
one self-described historian claimed that hitler eventually left argentina for paraguay and lived there inside an opulent underground bunker , which was turned into a hotel after his death in 1971
the express wrote
hitler escaped to a secret antarctic base , but dont worry we nuked it
in a particularly imaginative variation of the basic submarine escape story , a faction of theorists claim that hitlers u-boat detoured to antarctica , depositing the leader at a secret nazi ice base before continuing to south america with his lesser officers
hitler refused to use sarin during wwii
the mystery is why
in any case , the story goes , hitlers presence in antarctica explains secretive british and u.s. military missions to the continent in the aftermath of world war ii culminating in a nuclear attack on the nazi ice base in the 1950s
none of this is true , of course
or at least , so claimed two researchers in 2007 , when they wrote a 21-page peer-reviewed paper attempting to debunk the notion of a nazi ice base in antarctica
as we said above , the french researchers who claim to have autopsied hitlers bones are not the first to hope that science can finally lay him to rest
and they probably wont be the last
