crowds immediately fled from the gunshots , stampeding through the food court , jumping over checkout counters and hiding inside stores
if bradford did draw his weapon in the aftermath of the shooting , as police say , he was one of several people to do so , according to al.com

he died on the tile between a gamestop and a footaction , blood pooled around his head
in time , more officers gathered around the body , and several onlookers took pictures
