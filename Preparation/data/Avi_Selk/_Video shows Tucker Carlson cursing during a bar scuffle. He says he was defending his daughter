in a statement released by attorney michael avenatti , a country club patron said he may pursue criminal charges against tucker carlson after cellphone video showed the fox news host appearing to threaten him during a scuffle at the bar
you better get the f -- - out of here
carlson yells repeatedly in the oct. 13 video as juan manuel granados sits at the farmington country club bar in charlottesville
a moment later , an unidentified man standing with carlson grabs granados by his collar and appears to yank him up from his seat , at which point bystanders break up the confrontation
carlson has not disputed that the incident took place and even volunteered that his son threw a glass of wine in granadoss face just before the video began
but the conservative news host denied assaulting granados and accused him of provoking the scuffle by insulting carlsons daughter
carlson wrote in a statement to reporters this weekend , after avenatti published the video on twitter
in carlsons version of events , he was having dinner at the club with two of his adult children and some friends on oct 13
upon learning she was the right-wing commentators daughter , carlson said , the man responded , are you tuckers whore
and called her a misogynistic slur
reads his statement , which did not directly address the scene in the cellphone video
avenatti , who is known for representing accusers of president trump and justice brett m. kavanaugh , called carlsons statement an absolute lie.
he subsequently released statements from granados and two unnamed people he said witnessed the altercation all of them contradicting carlsons claims that his daughter was insulted
in his version , granados was sitting with a group of friends at the bar and noticed that a woman from carlsons table kept walking back and forth to order drinks
she was intoxicated , avenatti said
he said granados had been drinking , too , and finally told the woman , without realizing she was carlsons daughter i cant believe youre having dinner with him.
a little political context granados immigrated to the united states from buenos aires , according to his biography at the womens initiative a mental-health provider where he sits on the board of directors
hes also an lgbtq rights volunteer in charlottesville where a protester was killed at a white nationalist rally last year
granados sued a sports club several years ago when it refused to give him , his partner and their son a family membership , resulting in a policy change after more than 200,000 people signed a petition to support the gay dads
how tucker carlson is trying to normalize trumps response to charlottesville
carlson is , if not the polar opposite of granados , at least a few time zones away across the ideological landscape
gay rights group have repeatedly accused him of mocking their causes on his highly rated fox news show
he has warned against the supposed danger of diversity and demographic changes , as politico noted
earlier this month , a group of antifascists allegedly surrounded his house , beat on his door and terrorized his wife
granados would hardly be the first person this year to mix politics and public dining
see white house press secretary sarah sanderss aborted meal at the red hen sen. ted cruz shouted out of a restaurant in the district and the los angeles bar that hosted a confrontation this summer between antifascists and the far-right proud boys
but in a statement released sunday through his attorney , granados denied provoking anything let alone insulting carlsons daughter or making her cry
i never called any member of his family any names , granados said.
i never attacked his daughter as tucker claims
tucker has created this story out of thin air it never happened
rather , granados said carlson , carlsons son and a third man walked over to the bar after carlsons daughter complained to them
everyone seems to agree that carlsons son doused granados with wine
avenatti said granados threw his drink at the son in retaliation
granados said in his statement
tucker carlson walks back bogus south africa scaremongering
the 43-second video , whose author has not been publicly identified , is largely a cacophony of overlapping voices and jangling cutlery punctuated by carlsons f-bombs
why should i get out of here
i live here.
granados says a few seconds before a man wheels toward him from carlsons side , appears to grab his collar and lifts him into the camera frame
an onlooker yells.
theres no excuse for violence.
im just saying theres no need for violence , the onlooker repeats
there will be , the man appears to say before everyone is ushered away from the bar
two days later , long before the incident became public , carlson complained on a national review podcast that he couldnt go to restaurants anymore without being cursed out
i get yelled at , he said.
it just wrecks your meal.
avenatti said he will likely file a complaint of assault and battery against the man and complaints of violent threats against carlson and his son
fox news has not replied to a request for comment on the accusations
nor , he said , did he know anything about granadoss ethnicity or sexual orientation before the incident.
not that it would have mattered , carlson said
carlson said he complained to management at the country club immediately afterward , and granadoss membership was revoked after a three-week investigation
the club did not identify the witnesses its investigators spoke to
neither did avenatti , who provided statements from two people he said were at the bar and never heard granados insult carlsons daughter
avenatti did confirm his clients membership was revoked last week
he blamed carlson
theres no question hes attempting to use his notoriety and influence to have this man excluded from the club , the lawyer said
