on a bridge overnight in northern detroit , police said a man looked down at the midnight traffic on interstate 696 and considered the fall
it looked like more than a 20-foot drop from the photos
by the time the first officers got to the overpass about 1 a.m. , fox 2 reported the man was still there , deciding which way to go
police blocked off the lanes beneath the bridge , and negotiators started to talk to the man
they urged him , of course , to walk off the bridge and continue his life
below , the highway under the bridge was also closed in both directions , fox 2 reported
there was nothing unusual about any of this
its routine to shut down the roads when someone threatens to jump
but at some point early tuesday morning , while police continued to talk the man on the bridge , a semitractor-trailer rig crept past the barricade on the interstate and pulled to a stop directly beneath him
a second rig joined it
then another , and another
onlookers started to film as they formed a sort of bridge beneath the bridge a safety net of metal to break any fall
michigan state police were organizing this , a lieutenant later told the associated press
it wasnt the first time they used truckers to stop a suicide , he said , but it was unusual to see so many volunteers
when the last 18-wheeler pulled up under the coolidge highway bridge sometime before sunrise , there were 13 of them in total
from one wall of the interstate to the other , it was nothing but rigs , their roofs just a few feet shy of the bridge
the whole process took three or four hours , the ap wrote
by the end of it , the man who had once been alone with his thoughts had police on each side of him , talking to him , and a row of truckers sitting vigil below , refusing him his option to fall
so the man , whoever he was , walked off the bridge and into a hospital , fox 2 reported
police cleared out of the highway , and the 13 rigs and their drivers also went on their way
any way but down
this photo does show the work troopers and local officers do to serve the public
but also in that photo is a man struggling with the decision to take his own life
please remember help is available through the national suicide prevention lifeline at 1-800-273-8255
