the hill has discovered that brian kilmeade , who co-hosts president trumps favorite morning program , fox & friends , is funding the presidents campaign to the tune of a cool $ 601.71
this might not be shocking , as the hosts of fox & friends often sound as impressed by trump as trump sounds impressed by them
but wait , says kilmeade there is a simple explanation he did not realize he was making an official campaign contribution when he innocently purchased hundreds of dollars worth of trump maga hat christmas ornaments in the heady days after the 2016 election
theres no secret , theres no ah ha moment , kilmeade told the hill on tuesday
i had no idea that this would be considered a donation
im looking for something cool and unique for christmas for adults after this historic election
his search led him to the iconic make america great again baseball hat ornament , which the trump campaign was selling for $ 149 a pop in november 2016
this email has a little bit of everything
the baubles were certainly unique
commemorating trumps commitment to the christmas spirit , they were molded from brass and finished in either 14-karat or 24-karat gold ( the description on trumps website was inconsistent )
some people assumed the ornaments were a hoax and deluged an amazon.com page for the ornaments with one-star joke reviews
( it tried to put my nativity figures in an internment camp
would not buy again )
the price was slashed to $ 99 by the end of the year , and you can now buy one on donaldjtrump.com for a mere $ 45
alert the trump hat christmas ornament is now only $ 99
if you do so today , a disclaimer will inform you that your money is going to trumps campaign
kilmeade told the hill that he didnt see anything like that , and a fox news representative said kilmeade purchased the trinkets off a now-defunct website that may not have informed him
they were a little expensive in retrospect , but that was it , kilmeade told the hill
i had no idea that would go to a campaign contribution
federal election commission records show that the campaign logged kilmeades $ 601.71 on the day of trumps inauguration in january 2017 and simultaneously rolled the donation forward to the 2020 primary campaign
a fox news spokesman did not directly respond when the washington post asked whether the network has any rules against campaign donations
the hill reported that the network sent a statement to the effect that it does not prohibit talent from buying holiday ornaments
while some news outlets do prohibit donations ( keith olbermann was suspended from msnbc after donating to democratic candidates in 2010 , for example ) , fox news has tolerated the practice in the past
one of the networks biggest starts , sean hannity , donated nearly $ 10,000 to republicans in 2010 and advised trumps presidential campaign in 2016
for his part , trump is a fan of fox news
he routinely praises the networks right-leaning coverage while dismissing other major outlets as fake news
that said , kilmeade is occasionally critical of trump at least more so than his fox & friends co-hosts , one of whom has literally called trump his friend
kilmeade scolded the president this month , for example , after trump mocked a woman who accused supreme court justice brett m. kavanaugh of sexual assault
on wednesdays episode of fox & friends , kilmeade made no mention of his christmas ornaments
it was a fairly typical episode , devoting half its airtime to ominous coverage of a migrant caravan in southern mexico that trump has been worried about lately
