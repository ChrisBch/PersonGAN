phoenix arizona friends and family of john mccain remembered the late senator at an emotional ceremony wednesday , with gov
doug ducey telling those assembled that mccains fight for america isnt over.
on what would have been mccains 82nd birthday , his body lay in state at the arizona capitol , where several of his longtime colleagues delivered tributes
the ceremony was the first of five days of public and private events in phoenix and washington honoring mccain , who died saturday of brain cancer
mccains daughter meghan sobbed as the ceremony began and later broke down in tears as she stood in front of her fathers casket and bid him farewell
the list of participants in the proceedings reflected the crossroads at which the arizona republican party finds itself in the wake of mccains death and at a time when the conservative base is lurching rightward
sen. jeff flake ( r ) , who has spoken emotionally about mccains legacy in recent days , delivered the benediction
a vocal critic of president trump who is retiring at the end of his current term , flake was joined by a group of other lawmakers representing the old guard of the party , including former senator jon kyl and former congressman jim kolbe
kyl , who has been floated as a possible successor to mccain , recounted his travels abroad with the late senator and called him a strong force for america in the world.
ducey will appoint a successor to the six-term senator who will serve through 2020

after the speeches , cindy mccain was the first to approach her husbands casket
she lay one hand on it for half a second , then touched it again and nuzzled her head against it briefly before moving on
others followed with their own silent goodbyes
jack mccain stood straight for several moments at the coffin before passing
meghan mccain leaned her body into the casket and openly wept
mccains children from his first marriage followed
the scene outside the building was a somber one wednesday morning as mccains casket , draped in an american flag , was carried out of a hearse by six members of the arizona army national guard
cindy mccain walked behind , arm-in-arm with her sons jack and jimmy , who like their father , both served in the military
a navy veteran , mccain also was honored as a hero for his service during the vietnam war
a thick column of white-uniformed navy officers and other members of the military stood at attention as the procession made its way forward into the capitols rotunda , where one wall bears a quote from the rev

a memorial service will be conducted saturday at washington national cathedral , where former presidents barack obama and george w. bush are among the expected speakers
mccain will be buried sunday in a private funeral at the u.s
naval academy in annapolis
outside the arizona capitol after wednesdays ceremony , more than 100 people had already lined up in the heat , though it would be hours before the doors would open to the public
said elaine lewis , who flew in from san diego for the memorial service and had been in line since 8:15 a.m
lewis said she is a democrat and therefore not a natural fan of mccain
but she believes he saved millions of lives when he voted last year against repealing the affordable care act
irene campbell , whose late husband also fought in vietnam , was also among those in line
i saw him as a prisoner in a cage , she said of mccain
as her daughter pushed her wheelchair slowly toward the capitol doors , campbell had little to say about the arizona republicans politics
