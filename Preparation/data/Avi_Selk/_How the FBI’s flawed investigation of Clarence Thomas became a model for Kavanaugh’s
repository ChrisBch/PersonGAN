democrats got their wish , as the fbi carried out a time-and-scope-limited investigation into the claims of at least two of kavanaughs accusers
maybe democrats also remembered all the deficiencies critics found with the thomas probe
the fbi never talked to or even knew to look for four potential witnesses who had knowledge of hills complaints about thomas , according to two wall street journal reporters who reinvestigated the case and wrote a book about it
hill later testified that the agents who spoke to her asked few pressing questions , stood her up for a follow-up interview , then misquoted her in their final report
in the end , the fbi report was used by republicans to discredit her and help secure thomass confirmation
in other words , democrats would have been wise to remember be careful what you wish for
senators first learned of hills accusations through the washington rumor mill , a few weeks before thomass confirmation hearings were set to begin
until then , the oklahoma university professor had told only a few friends and confidants about thomass allegedly obscene behavior when she worked for him in the 1980s
when a democratic staffer on the senate judiciary committee first contacted hill about the rumors in early september , 1991 , she was reluctant to share her story let alone tell it to the fbi
reporters jane mayer and jill abramson wrote in their book , strange justice the selling of clarence thomas.
but the chairman was afraid using his own investigators would look partisan , so he gambled on the fbi
it took several weeks and many conversations with senate staffers before hill changed her mind and decided to speak out
on sept. 23 , a few days after thomass confirmation hearings wrapped up with little drama , hill faxed bidens office a four-page affidavit accusing the nominee of years-long harassment
two fbi agents were on hills doorstep that same day
how joe bidens 1991 comments about the fbi and anita hill are now being used against democrats and biden 's response in 2018
the white house of president george h.w
bush ordered what it called a full , thorough and expeditious investigation as soon as committee leaders informed the administration of hills statement
its unclear if bush set any limits on to whom the fbi could speak , as president trump allegedly did for kavanaugh this weekend
hills recollections suggest the investigation leaned more toward expeditious than thorough.
the agents visited her on the evening of sept. 23 in oklahoma city , hill later testified to the senate committee
neither recorded the interview , she said , and neither asked her to give a written statement , though one of the agents took notes as she spoke
they were nice , she recalled
hill told the fbi , in general terms , what she had already written in her affidavit to the committee
she said thomas had hit on her over a period of several years when she worked as his assistant at the department of education and equal employment opportunity commission in the early 1980s
he turned casual conversations to graphic discussions of porn and sex , she alleged , ignored her protests and pressured her to go along with it
hill said she gave the fbi the names of people she thought could corroborate her allegations , including a close friend she had complained to at the time
the agents thanked her for her information and left her house
sen. patrick j. leahy ( d-vt. ) asked hill later , at a senate hearing
yes , she replied.
he almost assured me that he would come back.
but did they
the fbi has never publicly released a list of whom it interviewed over the next two days or even how many people to whom the agents spoke
but in all the testimony , reports , articles and books about the investigation in the decades since then , only a few names have been mentioned
the most significant and possibly only significant witness contacted by the fbi is susan hoerchner the close friend hill had mentioned to the agents
agents interviewed hoerchner at her home the same evening they spoke to hill
by all accounts , she vividly remembered her friends distress a decade earlier
mayer and abramson wrote in their book
hill sounded very depressed , hoerchner recalled , and said she was being sexually harassed by her boss , clarence.
the fbi also apparently spoke to nancy fitch , who , like hill , had worked for thomas in the 1980s
its unclear who referred the agents to fitch , but fitch later testified i trust judge thomas completely and had never seen him act inappropriately
little lies point to bigger lies how james comey thinks the fbi could investigate kavanaugh
in addition to citing hoerchner and fitch , an unverified draft copy of a senate report about the fbi investigation also lists allyson duncan , who is now a federal judge
she too vouched for thomass character
the list of potential witnesses the fbi did not speak to is a bit longer , mayer and abramson wrote in their book
after the thomas scandal had gone public , they wrote , three of hills old friends reminded her that she told them about thomass behavior in the 1980s and testified on her behalf at a senate hearing
the authors also tracked down and interviewed a friend hill had completely forgotten about , who said she had confided extremely explicit and upsetting sexual comments from thomas while she worked for him
none of those witnesses appear to have come up in the fbis september investigation into hills claims , which concluded three days after it began , with a visit to thomass house
unlike the probe into kavanaugh , already a source of speculation and spectacle , the fbi worked in near total secrecy in the summer of 1991
not even thomas knew about hills allegations until agents confronted him on sep. 25
and that was it
the fbi delivered its report to the white house almost immediately after interviewing thomas
about a half-dozen senators on the judiciary committee read the document over the following week
none of them seemed in a rush to act on it
the report was widely seen as a victory for thomas and his republican supporters the nominees total denial of hills claims and the lack of witnesses who corroborated her story made democrats wary of pressing the issue
the investigations existence might have never even been made public thomas might have been confirmed to the supreme court without further argument had the press not got wind of it
although the fbi report itself never leaked , newsday and npr learned of hills affidavit and broke the news in october , days before the senate was scheduled to vote on thomas
the scandal riveted the public and all but forced senators to hold an extraordinary televised hearing around the dueling testimonies of thomas and hill
the fbi report played a starring role if not also an adversarial one to hill
hill never mentioned judge thomas saying how well endowed he was , wrote one of the fbi agents , who had just watched hill speak on cnn.
hill never mentioned or referred to a person named long dong silver or any incident involving a coke can , all of which she testified to before the senate judiciary committee
the american bar association had concerns about kavanaugh 12 years ago
republicans dismissed those , too
republican senators seized on the agents account when they questioned hill
without explicitly saying so , they suggested she was making up details as she went
sen. orrin g. hatch ( r-utah ) told the committee , quoting from hills opening statement
sen. arlen specter ( r-pa. ) said
but in the report , hill said , she was quoted as saying he would ruin her career making it sound like thomas threatened her
as is now repeating with kavanaugh , most democrats stood by the accuser while republicans lined up for the nominee
but midway through the hearing , even senators who had encouraged hill to cooperate with the fbi were trying to play down the investigations significance , pointing out it had drawn no conclusions either way
biden told his colleagues
a week after the sensational hearing , a slim majority of senators voted to confirm thomas
opinion polls showed the public was on their side
only months after thomas took his supreme court seat did a majority of americans come to believe hill
reporters such as abramson and mayer ( who also interviewed one of kavanaughs accusers this month ) reinvestigated the allegations , turning up witnesses the fbi had not found and pointing out flaws in the quick-turn probe
one addendum to the fbis witness list after the investigation concluded and leaked into the news , another woman who used to work for thomas accused the nominee of very similar harassment , which thomas also denied
abramson and mayer wrote
the fbi asked instead what sounded like form-list background questions , such as whether thomas used drugs or could be entrusted with confidential documents
they just sat there and scratched their heads in wonder , wright recalled
