at least , those seemed to be the rules until sunday , when the president addressed himself with a nickname
so great that oil prices are falling ( thank you president t ) , trump wrote almost certainly referring to himself , and not the london-based rap musician , prez_t ( warning explicit content )
and shawna thomas of vice news wrote that she initially assumed trump was thanking the president of some unknown oil-producing nation
president t has arrived at the golf course
while this is purely speculation , its possible that trumps new nickname for himself means hes growing more comfortable with his presidential identity after nearly two years in the white house
or , conversely , trump is drawing some subliminal parallel between himself and his predecessor , whom he has referred to repeatedly as president o though not exactly warmly
trump just nicknamed himself president t. president t is so much better than president b.o
whatever the intent behind the term , it looks destined to follow other trump idioms into the cultural lexicon
within minutes of its coinage , atlantic editor david frum was experimenting with modes of sarcasm , while harsher critics of the president wrote president t into satirical childrens stories and criminal conspiracy fantasies
thank you president t
several others found a precedent in history for what president t did this weekend
they recalled a famous athlete and entertainer from the late 20th century , named laurence tureaud
if the name doesnt ring a bell , its because tureaud later renamed himself mr. t. perhaps the name trump will one day be similarly forgotten
only president t we acknowledge
