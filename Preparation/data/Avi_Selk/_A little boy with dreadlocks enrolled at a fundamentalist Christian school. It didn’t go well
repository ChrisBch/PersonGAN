the wrath of the internet came down on a tiny private christian school in central florida this week , over video of a 6-year-old being turned away on the first day of school because he has dreadlocks
its one of those stories where surprisingly few facts are in dispute between c.j
stanleys family and the school , and somehow it still ends in calls to the police , accusations of racism and death threats
dont worry c.j
is fine , albeit perplexed as to how his hair style became fuel in a national outrage
anyway , heres the story of how his first week of school went all wrong
a book christian academy has been educating children in the orlando suburbs since 1971 , the schools administrator sue book told the washington post
and at no point in those 47 years has any boy been allowed to have long hair in class
clinton stanley sr. is religious , too , in his own way
he said from his home in apopka , just north of orlando the same city where the reverend built his school
now a 36-year-old barbecue caterer , stanley was no more than a baby in the reverends hey day
he had his son just six years ago
that would be clinton jr. , better known as c.j
was four years old , stanley said , the boy started asking for dreadlocks
his godfather had them , so he wanted them , too
when he wants something , hes got to meet his requirements , stanley said.
his requirements were he had to learn how to spell
i said , you learn these words , you get your hair twisted
he loved it.
wore the dreads through kindergarten , and was still in love with them in the summer , when stanley and his wife decided to switch him to a smaller , more hands-on school
so they got a scholarship through a state program to help with the tuition , and enrolled him in book christian 48 students , about half a dozen teachers counting the piano teacher and sue book
here comes the dispute , such as it is
a valedictorian went rogue in his final speech
his school tried to shut him down
stanley said hed never seen the book before monday , on what was supposed to be c.j.s first day of first grade
or else id have never put my son through this embarrassment , he said
they pulled up to book christian shortly after sunrise
was strapped into his backpack and toting a little lunch pouch
he wore the tie and an embroidered button-down shirt his dad had ordered from the school
his dreadlocks bobbed on either side of the collar
as he recalled , it was the reverend himself who stopped them in the front office.
he said , take him home and take him to a haircut , stanley said
sue book said it was actually she who explained that c.j.s dreads were not permitted
they knew the rules when they came in , she said
at no point in his sons life , stanley said , had he ever talked to the boy about race
were all one people , he said.
i always tell him to treat people nice.
but as he stood in books office listening to her employees cite a rule book paragraph about unnatural hair , stanley said , he wondered how he would explain to c.j
that his curls were forbidden
youre natural
he remembered thinking.
and then , just as he was about to walk his son back to the car with his un-enrollment papers , he turned around , opened the facebook live app on his phone , and took a deep sigh
if thats not bias , i dont know what is , he said to the camera
my so was told he ca n't attend school with his hair

can i braid it up
is that okay
stanley asked a woman at the desk
handbooks
stanley said , his words coming slow and soft with apparent astonishment.
wow , wow , wow.
there was more talk of paperwork
stanley said he understood the rules , but the rules were wrong
a haircut was out of the question , anyway
he asked to un-enroll his son
i dont even want him here
period , he said
okay , said the woman at the desk
lets go , man , stanley said , and walked c.j
back to the car to tell his wife what happened
can i braid it up in a pony tail
asked when they were on the other side of the parking lot
cant , stanley said.
no dreadlocks , son
only at the very end of his video did stanley show any anger
stanley said he never saw any police , but sue book said she called the sheriffs office because he kept standing on school property , complaining to other parents
unfortunately , the administrator said , shed feel the need to call the police again in the days to come once the death threats started
stanley has no idea how hundreds of thousands of people found his facebook video , but they did enraged parents and outraged activists
the schools facebook page was bombed with bad reviews ( typical horrible staff and horrible policies
racism at its finest.
this is absolutely infuriating
this sharp young black boy , clean as ever , gets kicked out of school because he has dreads
his father rightfully struggles to maintain his emotions at the disappointment of it all
then came the press
by wednesday , the story had gone national , and sue book had to find a volunteer to teach her class so she could spend the day answering nonstop phone calls
five sheriffs deputies had to come by on the second day of classes to keep an eye on the place , sue book said
she was expecting a protest in front of the school at any moment
asked how her 48 students were handling the crisis , she walked the phone into her grade 5-7 classroom and called out are you happy
yes maam
the children cried in unison
does it matter what color you are to me
book asked the class
no maam
whats my rule about color
the childrens chorus replied after a moments hesitation it doesnt matter
and his supporters are trying to start a petition that would pull the books state funding unless they change their half-century old hair policy
but thats all grown-up stuff
as for c.j
stanley said he and his wife enrolled the boy in public school as soon as they drove away from book christian
so he didnt miss much school
the classes are more crowded than stanley would like , and there will be no bible lessons for c.j
but thats okay
he gets to keep his haircut , and whatever else he took away from a school hell likely never see again
the owner of the red hen explains why she asked sarah huckabee sanders to leave
a valedictorian went rogue in his final speech
his school tried to shut him down
