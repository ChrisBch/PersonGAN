about a dozen people were inside hot yoga when a man with a black bag walked in around 5:30 p.m. , the tallahassee democrat reported
the studio had advertised a pilates certification class for the weekend
among the yoga students were florida state university student maura binkley , 21 , and 61-year-old nancy van vessem , a local physician and a faculty member at florida state
both women were killed in the gunfire
police were still investigating a motive behind the shooting
beierle had been arrested twice in the past six years by the universitys police , according to criminal records
the first time was in 2012 , when two women accused him of grabbing their buttocks on campus , the democrat reported
he was detained again two years later for trespassing in a dining hall
about a month after the 2014 arrest , buzzfeed news reported , beierle posted a series of youtube videos about his hatred of women under the name scott carnifex.
other outrages in his life included women who gave him their phone numbers and later told him they had boyfriends
in one video he identified with elliott rodger , an avowed misogynist who killed six people at the university of california at santa barbara earlier that year
in other videos beierle spewed racism , according to the associated press
he denigrated black women as disgusting and suggested planting land mines to stop people trying to cross the u.s.-mexican border , ap said
charges were dismissed for both of beierles university arrests , but he agreed to a plea deal after a final arrest by tallahassee police in 2016
according to a police report , he was living in an off-campus apartment in his late 30s noticeably older than the other residents and one day offered to put lotion on a 19-year-old sunbathing by the pool
when the woman declined , she told police , beierle slapped her butt , and grabbed it and then shook it.
on friday evening , survivors said beierle kept walking in and out of the yoga studio as class began , according to melissa hutchinson , who works at a restaurant below hot yoga and later cleaned a survivors blood off the kitchen floor
hutchinson told the democrat.
but nobody said anything.

the man eventually stopped in the studios doorway , pulled a gun from the bag and loaded it in front of the students
only then did people try to flee or fight
everyone started pounding on the windows and the walls , hutchinson said.

shanta combs told the democrat she was drinking with friends at bar on betton when they heard the bartender yell 'active shooter , get down , get away from the window

the person in the t-shirt had been pistol-whipped while trying to fight off the gunman , police later said
she told the democrat
