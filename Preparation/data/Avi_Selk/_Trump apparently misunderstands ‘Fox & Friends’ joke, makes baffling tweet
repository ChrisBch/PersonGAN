its that time again when the president of the united states tweets apparent nonsense into the world and we all parse it for meaning like a haruspex going through a wad of sheep entrails
tuesdays tablet came down from the white house at 8:32 a.m. , eastern time
the paid d.c. protesters are now ready to really protest because they havent gotten their checks - in other words , they werent paid
screamers in congress , and outside , were far too obvious - less professional than anticipated by those paying ( or not paying ) the bills
at least this one was syntactically coherent
at least it was not seven random letters published in the middle of the night that sent thousands of people on a futile search for the meaning of covfefe.
at least it was not a bizarre non sequitur that caused people to invent an entire conspiracy theory to explain it
but in terms of semantics , tuesdays message has no clearer meaning than covfefe or the calm before the storm.
what is he talking about
the tweet appears to be rare multilayered nonsense
nonsense within older nonsense
onto this original falsehood , trump has now stacked the baffling claim that the paid protesters were not , in fact , paid they havent gotten their checks , as he wrote
this is the conundrum the world is trying to solve
in a literal sense , its true that the protesters didnt get checks , because as far as anyone knows they had not expected any payment
but trumps tweet seems to be an elaboration on the original fiction , rather than a retraction of it
as best we can discern , hes saying the imaginary benefactors of imaginary paid protesters have skipped out on their imaginary obligations and left the imaginary paid protesters with imaginary unpaid wages
its a weirdly specific scenario to conjure out of thin air
we cant even find any fake news articles to support it
the white house has not responded yet to a request for clarification
while we wait for one possibly forever here are two popular theories as to what on earth trump meant
here are all the times we 're pretty sure that trump was watching fox news as president
the first theory was developed by trumps faithful on online message boards , such as reddits forum the_donald , where the existence of paid protesters ( and pretty much anything else trump claims ) is treated as unquestioned fact
those folks dont seem to have any idea what trump is talking about , either
rather , they have decided his nonsensical tweet was a trap a gambit to lure the fake protesters out of hiding
one of the problems with this theory is that so far no one seems to be falling for the supposed trap
no one is posting under trumps tweet i was so paid
perhaps because no one exists to post such a thing
rather , the dominant theory outside the pro-trump message boards is that the president has been watching fox & friends again
hes been known to do this sort of thing before
trump sent his tweet out into the world at 8:32 a.m. , as we said
as some have noticed , this was just half an hour after his favorite morning show featured a discussion about the apocryphal paid protesters
the writer asra nomani was invited onto fox & friends to talk about various liberal organizations she says helped organize some of the kavanaugh protests
( though she didnt mention it , conservative groups do this as well see the obamacare protests a few years ago )
in case it wasnt clear , nomani later told mediaite her latter remark was sarcasm
and yet within the hour , trump tweeted the same thing with no irony implied
if the true meaning of trumps tweet is simply that he failed to understand a joke , then that is not exactly the most profound of insights
or maybe it was nothing more than mere projection
after all , trump actually did solicit paid actors to fill out his presidential campaign announcement in 2016 and then failed to pay the bill for months
the lines made no more sense than they had in the morning , but trumps crowd cheered all the same
no , george soros isnt paying kavanaugh protesters
here are all the times were pretty sure that trump was watching fox news as president
