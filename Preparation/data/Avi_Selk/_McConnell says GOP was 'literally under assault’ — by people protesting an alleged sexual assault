i couldnt be prouder of the republican senate conference , mcconnell told reporters monday , two days after kavanaugh was sworn in despite accusations of sexual misconduct and nearly unanimous democratic opposition
the last three words stood out
literally under assault
senatemajldr assault ... like they pinned you down and put their hands over your mouth so you could n't breathe
did they expose themselves to you too
you mean an almost attack
ok. poor thing
maybe you remembered it incorrectly
sexual assault survivors were among the hundreds of protesters who interrupted hearings and yelled at senators in the halls of the capitol last week
they rallied around women who have accused kavanaugh of sexual misbehavior , which he denies
at the height of the protests , california professor christine blasey ford testified that the nominee once pinned her to a bed and tried to rape her when they were teenagers
in other words she described an assault
on the contrary , no senators are known to have been physically attacked during the kavanaugh protests
a woman was accused of assaulting someone outside republican sen. susan collinss office , cnn reported on friday , though police didnt know what took place
otherwise , the protests appear to have been overwhelmingly nonviolent
two women who said they were sexual assault survivors cornered sen. jeff flake ( r ) in an elevator at one point and begged him not to vote for kavanaugh
a crowd showed up outside mcconnells house to sing what do we do with a drunken justice
hundreds of protesters were arrested over the course of the confirmation battle , though the vast majority faced minor charges such as crowding , obstructing , or incommoding and were quickly released
mcconnell didnt specify which incidents he was referring to in his news conference , and he later downgraded the literal assaults to almost attacks
mcconnells news conference echoed the unfounded claims from president trump and many other republicans , who say the majority of the anti-kavanaugh protesters were paid agitators
democrats say the gop is concerned that voters who believed the accusations will punish republicans in november
the very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make senators look bad
dont fall for it
also , look at all of the professionally made identical signs
paid for by soros and others
these are not signs made in the basement from love
if thats a concern for mcconnell , he didnt show it
rather , he said at the news conference , the democratic intimidation campaign will backfire and inspire republicans to turn out at the polls
he told reporters
while it almost certainly was not intentional , he echoed kavanaughs opponents there , too
in her testimony last month , ford spoke of a surge of adrenaline coursing through her body as , she said , kavanaugh pinned her to a bed
a viral confrontation with sen. flake made her the woman in the elevator
shes trying to make that matter
most of the protesters arrested during kavanaugh confirmation have been released
