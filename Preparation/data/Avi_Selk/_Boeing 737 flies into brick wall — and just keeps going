an air india pilot flew a boeing 737 through a brick wall friday
incredibly , that marked the beginning of its journey and not the end
the jet not only clobbered the top of a five-foot perimeter wall but also destroyed a small landing guide tower as it climbed out of tiruchirappalli international airport in tamil nadu , india , shortly after midnight , the times of india reported
with 130 passengers on board , it was bound from the southern tip of india to dubai across the ocean
and despite the audible and obvious collision , the pilot apparently saw no reason not to continue on

no casualties reported so ashok kumar
air india express flight 611 continued to climb above the cloud line
it crossed the subcontinent and headed out over the indian ocean , the pilot apparently unaware that the plane had a gash along its belly and mesh fencing wrapped around the landing gear
it flew for about two hours before someone in ground control second-guessed the pilots confidence
eight years earlier , another boeing 737 flown by air india had been returning from dubai when it crashed in mangalore , exploded and killed 158 people
the government has lately been trying to sell the debt-laden airline , as air travel booms in india despite episodic concerns over safety
less than a month ago , dozens of people on a jet airways flight out of mumbai bled from their faces because crew forgot to pressurize the cabin
dozens bleed from ears and noses after flight crew forgets to pressurize plane
flight 611 was about halfway to dubai when it turned around and headed back to india in what the airline would later call a precautionary measure.
the plane landed in mumbai about four hours after takeoff , according to air indias statement
the passengers all apparently uninjured were routed onto other flights , and crew began to inspect the plane
as seen in photos published by indian journalists , the exterior casing along the bottom of the 737s fuselage had been torn open like a flesh wound
scrapes , dings , exposed framework and broken bits covered the planes underside
ndtv anchor vishnu som remarked on twitter
and this one is like a deep gash
the pilot and co-pilot have been taken off the roster pending a review , according to the airline
the countrys minister of commerce , industry and civil aviation , suresh prabhu , said he has ordered a third-party investigation into various safety aspects at air india
he has also tightened oversight of all the countrys airlines in light of the incident
growth cant be at the expense of safety.
