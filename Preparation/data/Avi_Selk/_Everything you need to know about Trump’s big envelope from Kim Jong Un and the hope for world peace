wh releases photos of pres trump receiving king jong-un letter from senior nk official kim yong chol
mighty big envelope

did kim jong un send trump that big envelope
why is it so big
what 's inside
a letter , presumably
trump has n't revealed what it says , but a north korea expert told the associated press it is probably a friendly letter , indicating respect and a willingness to negotiate

what other diplomatic milestones have involved oversized envelopes
according to the ap , kim jong un also sent a big letter to south korean president moon jae-in during the olympics
however , video analysis suggests this was a just regular-sized letter inside a nice folder

was kim 's letter to trump like that
will the summit later this month lead to peace between the united states and north korea
to be determined
