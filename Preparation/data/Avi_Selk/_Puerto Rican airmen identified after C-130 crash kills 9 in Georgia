col. pete boone , a spokesman for georgias air national guard , said at a news conference in front of the crash site on thursday
boone said the military had only begun to investigate the cause of the crash including whether it could be related to maintenance performed on the plane shortly before it took off , or the crafts age
he said the c-130 was built in the late 1970s and had been in georgia for routine maintenance
this contradicted boones counterpart in puerto rico an adjutant general who had said the plane was more than 60 years old and that wednesdays flight was supposed to be its last before retirement

isabelo rivera , the adjutant general of puerto ricos national guard , described the islands air fleet as old and in disrepair on wednesday
of the units six c-130-type planes , he said , two were inoperable and the one destroyed wednesday had been scheduled for retirement in arizona
rivera told the associated press after the crash
this pains us , he added
whatever its exact age , the destroyed c-130 had been used to rescue americans stranded in the british virgin islands after hurricane irma hit the caribbean late last year , the ap reported
days later , hurricane maria slammed into the 156th airlift wings home base in puerto rico , and the plane subsequently transported supplies from the u.s. mainland to the ruined island
nine airmen from the puerto rico national guard were killed in yesterday 's military plane crash , officials say
all nine crew members killed wednesday had helped with the hurricane recovery effort , the ap wrote , even as the 156th struggled to rebuild itself
col. raymond figueroa , wing commander of the 156th , said in a military news release last month
now his unit will mourn again
chelsea sinclair , who works at a store near the crash site , told the island packet newspaper that the plane went down nose-first and shook the building
mark jones , speaking to the savannah morning news , said he was in his car when the plane hit the road in front of him
scott cohen tweeted what he said was footage of the crash from his businesss surveillance cameras
