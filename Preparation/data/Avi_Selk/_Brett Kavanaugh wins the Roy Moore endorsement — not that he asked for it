roy moore , hitherto occupied with suing people who accused him of sexually predatory behavior during his failed gop senate campaign in alabama , has lent his unsolicited endorsement to the similarly troubled supreme court nomination of judge brett m. kavanaugh
the verb , to moore , proved popular in the former alabama judges circle of remaining loyalists but didnt spread far beyond it
interestingly enough , the same thing has occurred again , compliments of the washington post in the eleventh hour of ...
but as kavanaughs friends spoke out to support him and his accuser christine blasey ford wavered on whether she would testify against the judge next week , moore made his sympathies explicit
he wrote in a statement published tuesday evening
brett kavanaugh case what a former sex-crimes prosecutor says about christine blasey ford 's allegations
as they did in his case
in fact , trump endorsed both moore and kavanaugh after they were accused
and while senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ) initially predicted moore would be expelled from government if he were elected , he later delegated judgment to the voters and an ethics committee
and contra moores equation of his situation with kavanaughs , the nominee has to date been accused by one woman , whose story was disputed by a witness she said was in the room
( that witness kavanaughs high school classmate , mark judge has since said he wont testify at any senate judiciary committee hearing on the matter )
moores list of accusers , on the other hand , grew throughout his campaign , until eight women had alleged behavior ranging from underage predation to sexual assault , and reporters discovered that some of the accusations had circulated in moores hometown for decades
moore wound up losing to jones by about 22,000 votes out of more than 1.3 million cast
as he wrote in one of his fundraising notes
he most recently sued sacha baron cohen , a comedian who tricked moore into sitting for an interview with a fake sex offender-detecting wand
