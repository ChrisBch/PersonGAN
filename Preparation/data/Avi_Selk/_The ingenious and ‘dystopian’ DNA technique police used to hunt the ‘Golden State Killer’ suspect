for decades , police say , the dna of the golden state killer sat in evidence storage a unique genetic fingerprint that could identify definitively the man who killed 12 people and raped 45 women across california between 1976 and 1986
and for decades , those samples were basically useless to investigators , who ran into the same wall that has frustrated police since the invention of dna forensics a genetic fingerprint is not much good unless you know whom it belongs to
whoever the killer was , he apparently was not one of the millions of convicts , offenders and arrestees in the fbis national dna database
the genetic samples from all those crime scenes merely identified the golden state killer as a big flashing question mark
until this week when police announced that they had broken through the wall and identified joseph james deangelo as the golden state killer suspect using an ingenious technique that thrills law enforcement officials and disturbs privacy advocates
they tracked their suspect through his family tree
police said they checked the crime scene dna against one of the genealogy sites that have lately become popular databases filled with the profiles of people who have volunteered their genetic codes in the hope of discovering their relatives and ancestors
gedmatch , a free service , confirmed that police used it to identify deangelo
the suspected golden state killer was not in this database , either , but it didnt matter
a distant relative of his was , police say , and that persons dna partially matched evidence related to the serial killer
instantly , the pool of suspects shrank from millions of people down to a single family
detectives then used traditional investigative techniques to narrow the family members down to one suspect deangelo , a 72-year-old former police officer who lived within a few miles of many of the attacks
authorities used dna , genealogy website , to track down golden state killer suspect decades after crimes
others , however , hope it could lead to a world where no criminal ever feels safe , lest some distant cousins dna one day lead police to his door
police began exploring dna fingerprinting in 1985 a year before the golden state killer raped and bludgeoned his last known victim
it was used to help convict florida rapist tommie lee andrews two years later , time magazine reported then a string of other criminals , until it became commonplace for police to obtain dna samples from suspects to use as evidence in court
the fbi created a database of dna profiles in the 1990s , and police queued up to check their evidence samples against it , hoping that their suspect might be an ex-convict , or already imprisoned , or otherwise in the system
the method even allowed police to solve old cold cases some of them initially investigated long before dna testing existed
but the database was little help if the person tied to the dna wasnt already in it
one of the first cases in which a family members genes led police to a suspect was in britain
the mutilation and murder of lynette white on valentines day in 1988 was one of the countrys most notorious unsolved cases , the bbc wrote
three men had been wrongly imprisoned for the crime
a massive police hunt had failed to turn up the real killer
but in the early 2000s , the bbc wrote , police found a new dna sample at the crime scene under layers of paint on a skirting board.
the sample didnt match any profile in britains national database , but it partially matched with a 14-year-old boy whose dna was on file after an altercation with police
the boy was born after the murder , obviously , but he unwittingly led police to his uncle , who promptly confessed to the killing
police in los angeles had a similar stroke of luck in 2010 , when the dna of the grim sleeper a serial killer who had gone uncaught for decades partially matched to a man in the prison system
that man turned out to be the killers son , the los angeles times reported
the grim sleeper was identified as lonnie david franklin jr. and sentenced to death
these cases , however , still relied on dna obtained by police or through court orders if not from the suspect himself , then from a family member
its only in the past few years , as millions of people have submitted dna samples to ancestry websites , that police have used familial dna searches in ways that read like science fiction , whether you find them hopeful or horrifying
take the case of the canal killer a double slaying in phoenix that had gone unsolved since the early 1990s
the suspects dna was on file but matched no one in the fbi database
then in late 2014 , the arizona republic wrote , police met a genealogist at a conference and told her about the case
investigators eventually sent the genealogist , who did not live in the state , a profile of the canal killers dna sequence
two months later , the newspaper wrote , the genealogist emailed police the suspects likely last name miller
this was not some psychic intuition , the republic reported , but the result of searches the genealogist ran on family tree dna and ancestry.com , two of the most popular databases
that family name led police within weeks to suspect bryan patrick miller of the killings
they secretly collected his dna possibly from a discarded bottle or trash , the republic wrote and arrested him , alleging that he had the same genetic fingerprint as the canal killer
usry , who was a teenager at the time of the killing , was picked up by police at his doorstep in new orleans in december 2014 , wired wrote
he was interrogated by an fbi agent and spent a month under suspicion all because the killers genetic code was similar to his fathers , whose dna sample had been obtained by ancestry.com
but unlike miller and deangelo , usrys dna test ruled him out as a suspect
his father was one of many false positives that plague familial dna testing , wired wrote
familial dna searches , in fact , had an 83 percent failure rate in a 2014 british study , wired wrote
this is part of the reason that many warn against the practice , even as law enforcement agencies master its uses
i remember a time when there was genuine concern over the introduction of bar codes and mag stripes on credit cards
theyll be used to track and control us today people cant wait to participate in their own surveillance
ellen nakashima wrote in the washington post in 2008 , long before the popularity of genealogy sites exploded
since then , wired reported , maryland and the district of columbia have banned familial dna searches , while the method is regulated in several other states , including california , where police used it to track down the golden state killer suspect
stephen mercer , a former public defender who helped pass the ban on familial search in maryland , told the post.
youre casting a wide net of suspicion over many , many people.
the use of genetic websites in the hunt for the golden state killer also led investigators to misidentify a potential suspect last year , according to court records obtained by the associated press on friday
the daughter of a 73-year-old oregon city man said authorities swabbed her father for dna in a nursing home without her knowledge
aware that their millions of customers dont necessarily want to inform on their relatives , some genealogy companies actively resist handing over data to police , stat wrote this week
23andme , one of the earliest and most popular dna search companies , has refused all law enforcement requests , the outlet wrote
ancestry has , too at least since 2014 , when police used its database to erroneously accuse usry of the 1996 idaho falls murder
however , the california investigators did not use either of those sites to find the family of the golden state killer suspect
rather , they reportedly ran their old evidence through gedmatch , a relatively small , free service that allows users to upload and analyze their dna sequences
its precisely those other uses that now , after the sensational break in a 40-year-old serial killer case , excite and alarm so many people
i think its revolutionary , richard shelby , a former sacramento county sheriffs department detective who hunted the golden state killer in the 1970s , told the post after this weeks arrest
justin jouvenal , drew harwell and tom jackman contributed to this report
she stalked the golden state killer until she died
some think her work led to the suspects arrest
all we know about joseph deangelo , the golden state killer suspect who became a suburban grandfather
