kathleen amina deady stood in front of a pastry counter in riverside , calif. , holding a key fob and wearing a veil across her face
only her eyes peeked through the veil
in islam , it is called a niqab , though the man standing in front of deady at the coffee bean & tea leaf on friday had other words for it
is this halloween or something
he asked deady , leaning in toward her and scowling as she began to record on her phone
behind the counter , two baristas looked up with concern
why did you say that
deady asked the man , still quiet and cheerful in her tone
why wouldnt i
the man replied , then looking back toward the register
deady asked him again why would you say that
because i want to.
whats wrong with me
you tell me whats wrong with you.
do you know im a muslim
the man looked back at her.
yeah , i do.
it was around this point that other customers scattered around the coffee shop took notice
barry landau , a self-described regular , would later tell ktla-tv that he had often noticed deady in the shop , usually reading
books about cardiology and such , landau said
he figured deady was studying to be a doctor , but on friday , he told the station , he paid more attention to the man in a t-shirt yelling at her
deady stood her ground and continued to record
whats your problem with me
she asked the man , who has not been publicly identified
a pro-white town manager wants races to separate , rails against islam and refuses to quit
have you read the koran
ive read enough of it to know , the man replied
he was holding a $ 10 bill out to baristas behind the counter , but no one took it
now the conversation was flowing along the lines of many others that have taken place in the united states , in an age of rising anti-muslim rhetoric
the mans comment partially echoed the words of donald trump , who as a presidential candidate once said , i think islam hates us.
when deady asked the man why he thought she wanted to kill him , he didnt reply
he might have been referring to a koran verse that is often distorted by those who insist islam wants a war on unbelievers
as a muslim language-arts teacher once explained in the washington post
deady , who the post was not able to interview before publication , then asked the man , are you a christian
he was silent for a moment
still , no one behind the counter would take his money
absolutely , he finally said
in any case , the vast majority of christians , like the vast majority of muslims , do not cite their faith to justify murder
but it was far too late for reconciliation at the coffee bean by now
trumps surprising ramadan message to muslims
the man shoved a hand in deadys camera lens
he didnt want to talk
she began to yell , you are committing hate speech
a barista reached across the pastry counter and tried to physically separate the two , to not much effect

across the room , landau recalled to ktla , a radical christian woman with whom he was acquainted began to scream at deady
so landau chose a side and was heard in the video screaming and cursing at the man get out of here
get out of here
the man began to swear , too , and two workers behind the counter appeared to be consulting with each other before deadys camera briefly cut off
a sort of interlude
this statement went some way toward explaining the final scene in deadys video
she turned her camera back after several minutes had apparently passed as the man again stood before the cash register , now holding a small takeout container in his hand
whos the manager here
im the supervisor on duty , said a woman behind the counter
she gave the man her name and smiled uncertainly as deady asked from behind the camera
why are you not serving him
the supervisor tugged distractedly at a plastic glove on her hand
because hes disrupting a public space , she replied , then glancing up to watch the man storm out the front door
and being very racist , the supervisor added when he was gone
there was no more yelling now
in her video , which would be viewed by 2 million people on twitter and make news across the united states in coming days , deady nodded at the supervisor
thank you , she said
then she panned the camera once more around the coffee bean , where everyone seemed to have returned to their own business
correction an earlier version of this article misquoted the coffee shop supervisor
she said the man was being very racist , not really racist.
