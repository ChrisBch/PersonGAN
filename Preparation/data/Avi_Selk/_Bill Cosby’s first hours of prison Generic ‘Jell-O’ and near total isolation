bill cosby spent his first day in a pennsylvania prison much as he will spend many days to come mostly alone
he slept alone tuesday night on a cot bolted to the floor of a cell he shares with no one
when his door was unlocked wednesday morning , cosby stepped into a tv room that was empty except for his guards
several cells identical to his own lined the walls in this section of state correctional institution phoenix , and every one of them was vacant
cosby ate breakfast , lunch and dinner by himself
he walked the yard without company
four times that day at precisely 6:10 a.m. , 12:30 p.m. , 4:30 p.m. and at 9 p.m. before lights out a guard walked the unit to count the prisoners , and the count was always one
this quasi-isolation wont last forever maybe only a week or two
its mostly a coincidence that cosby was assigned to a brand-new prison that is still just barely half full
administrators decided out of caution to isolate him from the other prisoners until they can figure out what to do with one of the most famous sex offenders in the country for the duration of his three- to 10-year sentence
state corrections secretary john wetzel said in a statement that integrating cosby into the prisons general population about 3,600 inmates , once phoenix is at capacity was the long-term goal.
but exactly how long long term is remains to be seen
bill cosby sentenced to 3 to 10 years in state prison
simpson , another celebrity-turned-felon , doesnt think it can be done.
theyre going to have to put him in protective custody , he told tmz after cosbys sentencing
for the immediate future , at least , cosby seems less in danger from violence than from loneliness and boredom
a single friend sat with him in court on tuesday afternoon , manuel roig-franzia wrote for the washington post , when a judge pronounced his sentence for drugging and assaulting a woman in 2004
no family members were present
cosby was driven through a rainstorm and arrived that evening at sci phoenix a 164-acre compound of maximum security cell blocks , separated from the community by a mile and a half of razor wire and electronic fencing
the state began building the prison in the early 2010s and opened in july..
guards walked cosby into the prisons central building some time after 6 p.m. tuesday
he posed for his mug shot , traded what was left of his court outfit for a prison uniform and boots , and became inmate nn7687
he was then taken to the vacant cell unit , where he set up the toiletries and sheets that were his only provisions , and sat down to a dinner of meatballs , under the supervision of a guard at the monitoring desk
after dinner , at 9 p.m. cosby stood outside his cell for the first of many regulated head counts
a guard shone a flashlight into his cell some time in the middle of the night to make sure the units lone prisoner was still there
the full sci phoenix ritual is a mammoth daily schedule broken down into five-minute increments
breakfast in the cafeteria at 7 a.m
vocational classes at 8 a.m. chapel at 8:20
cease movement at 12:25
head count at half past the hour , then off to work for those with jobs in the laundry or the shoe factory
but cosby is a special case , and for the first week or so , at least , his ritual is a spartan thing
he eats , sleeps and recreates in his empty corner of the prison , served the same thing as the general population prisoners who congregate in cafeterias sprawled across the campus
wednesdays lunch menu was macaroni and cheese
thursdays includes strawberry gelatin for dessert
cosby can take no classes and no job , yet
he is allowed no visitors except his lawyers and religious mentors , if he has any
he can not mingle
he can watch tv alone in the empty common room when hes not locked in his cell
he can walk alone in the small yard outside his unit for up to four hours each day
cnn reported that cosby phoned his wife on wednesday morning , though worden could not confirm it
once he is classified , he will presumably be allowed to visit with his family , and purchase a tv and tablet for his cell , and perhaps look for classes or work to pass the days
if things go well , he may even get a roommate almost all the cells at phoenix are double bunks
so far , worden said , cosby has adjusted well to his new life.
good spirits , is the term that state officials use
his lawyers tried and failed to convince a judge to let him live under house arrest while he appeals his sentence
and the associated press reported that cosby has hopes of being transferred to a lower-security prison on the other side of pennsylvania that caters to geriatric inmates
worden , however , said there are no plans to move him out of sci phoenix
