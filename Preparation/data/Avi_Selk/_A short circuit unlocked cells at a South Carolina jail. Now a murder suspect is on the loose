another one of the men who overpowered a jail guard and escaped into the trees outside a small town in south carolina has been caught , authorities said tuesday night
but an accused murderer remains at large
tyshon demontrea johnson and curtis ray green , both facing trials for brutal murders , fled orangeburg detention center with a third inmate saturday after a short circuit caused their cell doors to automatically open
johnson and the third inmate , an accused carjacker , have since been recaptured , but the manhunt had not resulted in greens capture by early wednesday , leaving the jails frightened neighbors demanding to know how its systems could so utterly fail
the county decided to build a new jail after last years incident , the times and democrat newspaper reported , but construction had barely started before the dilapidated jails electrical systems frizzed out again , on saturday night , with disastrous results
it began with an electrical short in a control panel in a small pod of four cells , according to county administrator harold young , who spoke to reporters afterward
sensing the malfunction , a safety mechanism opened all four of the cell doors
but the freak occurrence , he said , created an opportunity for the four men being held
posted by orangeburg county sheriff 's office on sunday , may 20 , 2018
the youngest of the pods inmates , according to the county sheriff , was 20-year-old green who the times and democrat wrote was accused of shooting and killing an orangeburg man who caught him attempting to steal his car
with him was johnson , 27 , who was charged last year with one count of murder , two counts of attempted murder and armed robbery after three people were shot along old number six highway , the times and democrat reported
christopher shannon boltin , 27 , had been awaiting trial on charges of carjacking and grand larceny but was considered no less dangerous , according to the sheriffs office
the fourth inmate in the pod was not named
authorities said he participated in only the first stage of the escape attacking and beating the units single guard
once in control of their pod , the men still had to get out of the jail complex
several locked doors and a high barbed-wire fence separated them from freedom the thick cluster of trees , railroad tracks and the town beyond
but the second stage of the escape was relatively simple , as young explained it
one of the inmates simply walked up to the malfunctioning control panel and mashed buttons until more doors opened
falsely accused of satanic horrors , a couple spent 21 years in prison
now theyre owed millions
the administrator told wltx
only green , johnson and boltin made it over the fence , young said
their absence was discovered after the beaten-up jailer managed to resecure the cell unit , and guards conducted a head count of all 250-some prisoners in the facility
young told wtlx.
thats probably why he got caught quicker than the other two.
he meant boltin , the accused carjacker , who was captured sunday near the city of columbia about an hours drive north of orangeburg
he is now back in jail , along with his father , who is accused of helping him while he was on the lam , according to the state newspaper
on monday , several residents told reporters they were scared to go outside
on tuesday afternoon , orangeburg county sheriff leroy ravenell said that johnson was apprehended by the u.s
marshals , the associated press reported
ravenell said , according to the times and democrat
while a manhunt for green spreads out from the town , the county council has ordered young lead an investigation into what went wrong and how to prevent more rogue door incidents before the new jail is completed in 2020
among the options , the administrator told the wach station , was installing more fuses
