barely a week after multiple shark attacks forced the cancellation of an international surfing contest , the boards were back in the water off the southwest australian coast
andrew hill , 54 , paddled through the waters off gracetown last week
when he saw a cluster of fins slicing through the waves , he later told reporters , he didnt worry
an experienced paddle boarder , hill knew these werent great white sharks , which are believed to have mauled two surfers a few days earlier , on beaches just a few miles away
no , these were dolphins
nice , friendly dolphins
its good to see dolphins , hill told 7news perth.
surfers like seeing dolphins.
there looked to be more than a dozen in the pod , he said , likely herding fish
they wheeled around him as he stood on his board and paddled toward deeper water
a moment later , a neat row of nine dolphins merged with a wave heading straight toward hill
for a few seconds , this was beautiful their fins crowning the white tip of the wave , rolling in sync with it
hill continued to paddle as the dolphins dove and passed under him and around him
all except one , which beelined toward hill , leaped out of the water , and body checked him straight off his board
multiple shark maulings fail to keep australian surfers from the water
as we said , these werent sharks , which days before had tried to drag two surfers underwater , and put one in a hospital with a chunk torn out of his leg
the dolphin , in contrast , seemed satisfied to have thumped hill , and left him alone to scramble back onto his board while a witness gasped and filmed from the shore
in his tv interview after the video went viral , hill had no idea what hed done to offend the dolphin , and could only compare the blow to a game of rugby , which he took with a sportsmans grace
fairly legal hip-and-shoulder , i think , hill said.
hats off to him.
a man wrestled a rattlesnake to show off
he was bitten in the face and nearly died
a man fought a bobcat on video
then he found out it had rabies

a seal didnt actually hug a beluga whale , but we all wanted to believe
