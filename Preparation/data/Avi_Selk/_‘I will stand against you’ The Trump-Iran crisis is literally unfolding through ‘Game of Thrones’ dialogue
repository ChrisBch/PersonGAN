qasem soleimani , the commander of the quds force , irans external security agency , has posted this image on his instagram in response to trumps tweet
martins fantasy world
the words are an obvious play on winter is coming the unofficial motto of the protagonist stark family , whose eldest living member , jon snow , literally led a caravan of refugees through a border wall in season 5
trump might complain the starks are globalists , if he knew anything about the canon
the national iranian american council , which has condemned trumps plan to scuttle an obama-era nuclear deal and reimpose all sanctions , sees the president as less of a stark than a white walker fear-mongering , war-mongering , and championing division at every opportunity
donald trump is a literal white walker , fear-mongering , war-mongering , and championing division at every opportunity for political gain
its not really accurate to say the white walkers champion division , however , as they tend to assimilate everyone they kill into the same undead hive mind
but at least the national iranian american council seems familiar with the basic outlines of the plot
the cant be said of whoever runs hbos twitter account , which snarked at trump how do you say trademark misuse in dothraki
as if a civilization of desert raiders who barely tolerate the concept of free trade would have any use for trademark law

commander of the islamic revolution guards corps ( irgc ) quds force major general qassem soleimani responded to us president donald trumps announcement that sanctions are coming with a game of thrones-inspired meme of his
i will stand against you , it reads , below an icy image of the general standing stoic in profile in the snow
i will stand against you is not a motto of anyone in a song of fire and ice , game of thrones or hbos upcoming prequel series , the long night , as far as we know
although it could apply to many characters in george r.r
martins fictional universe , where crises between the factions of westeros are continuously born from their mutual suspicions , stubbornness and egos
we are waiting
i can stop you
quds force can stop you , soleimani wrote to trump on instagram , because this is the state of foreign diplomacy in 2018
you start this war , but we will finish it
the u.s. sanctions , aimed primarily at irans oil economy and feared to devastate the countrys poor , will go into effect on monday
the eighth and final season of games of thrones will premiere in 2019
