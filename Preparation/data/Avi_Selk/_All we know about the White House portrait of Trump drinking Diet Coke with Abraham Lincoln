previously spotted in d.c. gift shops and jigsaw puzzle boxes , a fantasy print of president trump entertaining abraham lincoln while every other republican president in history watches now hangs outside the oval office
the portrait was shown hanging in trumps personal dining room by 60 minutes , and the freeze frame instantly went viral , baffling people with questions such as
how did the painting get to the white house
why does trump look nearly as svelte as dwight eisenhower
is he drinking a diet coke
is that taft in the background
why is everyone laughing
what is lincoln saying to trump
from that weird store everyone walks by on m st to the white house ... what a journey
the white house has not responded to a request for comment
fortunately , the republican club by andy thomas is not an obscure artwork
thomas has sold countless prints of it online and through gift shops , as he has previous entries in his bipartisan series , such as true blues democratic presidents playing poker and callin the blue republican presidents playing pool
so the washington post tracked him down at his studio in carthage , mo. , to ask the worlds burning questions
the post what is going on in this painting
where even is this
thomas i put it in a private club type thing
not a restaurant , not a bar , but a private club
it shows all of the republican presidents , some of the more major ones in the foreground , but theyre all in there
theyre kind of story-telling
lincoln and trump in particular are relating , and everybody else is reacting
poor taft wonders what 's so funny and why he 's the one who always has to go get more snacks for everyone at the bar
the post what are lincoln and trump saying to each other
thomas i have no idea
thats the funny thing we dont know how they would get along
just because theyre all republican doesnt mean they actually like each other
the post how did it end up in the white house
thomas i once painted california republican congressman darrell issas portrait
we got to go to washington , and darrell gave us a tour
he had both of my original paintings in his office , of the presidents playing poker
we stayed in touch
darrells a real friendly guy
he contacted my wife , dina , one day and said 'gee , i saw youve got a new one
im going to show it to president trump
note a spokesman for issas office later confirmed this account to the washington post rep. issa and andy thomas are indeed friends , and the congressman has some of andys fine work in his office
president trump appreciates the art that andy does and the congressman did deliver the portrait to the white house
thomas a couple weeks ago , we got a call
somebody at the white house said , trump wants to speak with you
sure enough , he did
we had a real nice conversation
trump said something like im in the oval office with darrell issa , who you know , and vice president pence
were looking at your painting
ive never seen this
vice president pence tells me theyre very well known
i remember he said hes seen a lot of paintings of himself and he doesnt usually like them
he liked that one
he kept talking about my talent and this and that
he asked a little about politics
it lasted three or maybe four minutes
i hung up and said , im too good to go out and finish mowing the lawn.
( laughs )
the post so trump doesnt have the original painting
thomas its a high-quality laser print
the original is still in my studio
the post trump does look pretty good in your painting
he actually looks more athletic than he does in real life
thomas i wanted to make everybody look as good-looking as they can , and try to shed the pounds where i need to
or smooth some lines
i did it with every figure
made it slightly more realistic
the post his smile is very charming
i dont think ive ever seen trump smile like that
thomas its a good-feeling painting
i just assume people are nice
i try to make people as good-looking and happy as i could
the first painting i did in 2008 , originally i had richard nixon looking paranoid and covering his cards
i thought about that and thought that is not right
the poor man suffered from clinical paranoia , i shouldnt be making fun of it
i intentionally look for happy pictures
with trump , i looked through just a ton of photographs
some of the presidents smile naturally every time , and some dont
this is the second face i painted on trump
the original one , i had a very sweet picture of him smiling with melania and maybe his grandkids
it was very becoming of him , but it didnt look as much like trump as it should
the post is trump drinking a diet coke
thomas yes
i researched it
trump reportedly drinks 12 cans of diet coke each day
is that healthy
the post whats reagan got there
thomas i put what looks like kind of a fruity drink
reagans father was an alcoholic
i dont want to show whiskey in front of him
the post and george w. bush
thomas iced tea
and nixon enjoyed a good glass of wine
the post and lincoln
thomas water
this is mostly researched off the internet
i really dont know
who is she are the shadowy figures supposed to be past repub presidents too
if its the ghost of nikki haley future im out
the post ive heard theres some significance to the woman in the background
thomas that would be the first woman republican president
i did the same thing in the democratic painting
the post is your work styled after other artists
thomas i always liked the american illustrators
i do primarily western paintings cowboys and indians
frederic remington and charles russell are two of my favorites
and howard pyle
and some norman rockwells
but ive been doing artwork all my life since 1990 , full time
im 61 years old now
it becomes your own style
trump had this horrific piece commissioned
its a fantasy painting of gop presidents hanging out with him
i feel its in need of a caption
internet , do your thing
the post now that your painting is all over the internet and because everything with trump is so polarized some people are making fun of it
thomas laughs
im used to it
its kind of discouraging that sometimes people are so venomous , but thats the way it is
i just paint
its kind of a nice life
