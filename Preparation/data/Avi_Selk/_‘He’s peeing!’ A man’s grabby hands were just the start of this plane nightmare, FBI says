to paraphrase an old air travel axiom what goes in must come out , one way or another
there are approximately seven fluid ounces in a double vodka tonic give or take , depending on how generous frontier airlines is with the pour
michael allen haag ordered his first one shortly after his plane took off from denver on thursday evening , according to the fbi , with hundreds of miles still to go before it reached charleston , s.c
haag was assigned to a middle seat , but this didnt seem to bother him , as his fellow passengers would later recall in their interviews with police
two women sat on either side of him
one , by the window , was already asleep with her head on the tray table
the other was awake in the aisle seat , and she wore a tank top that she would later tell the fbi haag seemed very interested in
haag told the woman he was physically excited because he was flying to see his old girlfriend , an fbi agent wrote in a federal affidavit
as she recalled the conversation , he kept staring at her chest
she put on headphones and tried to fall asleep , but haag wouldnt stop asking her questions , she said
what sort of men did she like
oh , she was married
what sort of relationship did she have with her husband
what was her deal , she said haag asked her , when she made it clear she did not want to talk
haags first double was gone by now , the fbi agent wrote , so he ordered a second vodka tonic
how a wifes suspicions of infidelity diverted an entire flight
haags attention apparently shifted to the woman on his right
she recalled waking very suddenly , to discover that a 45-year-old man she did not know was touching her fingers
stop touching me , she told haag
he apologized , according to the affidavit but then kept apologizing , over and over , as he cornered her against the window
back off , she said
when haag allegedly touched her leg , she started to yell
about a dozen rows back , at the rear of the plane , a woman identified only as emily had also been asleep
she more or less had the whole row to herself
but now she woke suddenly , too , to the sound of an uproar in row 25
the woman in the window seat next to haag was standing straight up , the fbi agent wrote , calling for a flight attendant
emily told kdvr , including the expletives she heard
then emily watched with growing concern as a flight attendant marched haag to the back of the plane and gave him his own private row directly across the aisle from her
the man was at least very drunk , emily thought to herself , as haag took his new seat and fumbled for his seat belt
southwest hopes $ 49 fares will draw customers after its first passenger death
in the fbi agents words , haag was clearly intoxicated and possibly high.
but a flight attendant helped buckle him in , and for a while he seemed to go passive
sleep now behind her , emily took out her phone , thinking she would take a furtive picture of the strange man to show her friends
and then , the fbi wrote , haag unbuckled himself
emily shared two pictures with the cbs affiliate in denver
in the first , haag is slouched in his chair , his hands apparently folded over his lap
her second photo , taken a few moments later , looks no different except for the thin , clear fountain arcing from between the mans hands , seeming to land inside the magazine pouch in front of his knees
and i scream , emily recalled.
oh my god
and he was indeed peeing , the fbi agent wrote emptying two double vodka tonics and who knows what else into the small gap between seats
what goes in , must come out , but how it gets out makes all the difference
tsa has created secret watch list for unruly passengers
the plane landed in charleston shortly after 9 p.m. , after more than three hours in the air
emily said she and the two women in row 25 gave statements to police , and she eventually got a $ 200 flight voucher from frontier airlines
said a statement sent the the washington post by a spokesman for the airline.
we are supporting authorities in their investigation.
emily took one last photo of haag , this time being led through the terminal in handcuffs
he could not be reached for comment
he was released from jail the next day on a $ 25,000 bond , charged with interfering with a flight crew and two counts of indecent exposure worth up to 20 years in a federal prison if convicted
