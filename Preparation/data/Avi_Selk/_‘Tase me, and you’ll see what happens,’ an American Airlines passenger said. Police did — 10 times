all that was before , police say , jacob garcia lunged for an officers gun and kicked out a squad car window
better start at the beginning
garcia , 28 , with a handlebar mustache whose precise curls somehow survived the exertions to come , boarded the american airlines flight around 9 p.m. , bound for his hometown of chicago
but before the plane could leave the airport in miami , police wrote in their report , a seatmate accused garcia of touching her without her permission
an american airlines manager asked garcia to switch seats , police wrote at which point garcia began to scream and insult the woman and her boyfriend , and a fight broke out
passenger jabari ennis later recounted on twitter
ennis sent the washington post video of the first altercation , taken from his vantage point across the plane aisle
youre ignorant because youve got all these people standing here , a woman says in the video , standing over a seat that apparently contains garcia
youre ignorant
the seats occupant replies
put your finger down
the sound of slapping ensues
aa2246 - from my pov
the flight crew asked all passengers to deplane around that point , american airlines said in a statement
but garcia kept fighting , so several miami-dade police officers boarded the plane
the subsequent confrontation was recorded from multiple viewpoints by ennis and other passengers , some of whom expressed vocal interest in seeing garcia removed from the plane
you need to stop talking , dude , an onlooker told him , as three relatively large officers tried to lift the 5-foot-7 man from his aisle seat , and everyone ignored the captains voice over the intercom
what is the reason
im asking you right now.
the officers leaned over him
one took out handcuffs
one said do not fight.
you have to answer
do not fight
an officer said
fine , garcia said.
tase me , and youll see what happens.
quite a few passengers had also delayed getting off the plane , to watch garcia struggle
several spectators drew back when they saw officer roody desroches draw his stun gun , but kept watching
johnson , watch out , desroches warned the officer pinning garcia to his seat as he aimed the weapon
no , go ahead , garcia taunted.
go ahead , johnson.
the other officer moved out of the way , and desroches pulled the trigger
garcias shirt seemed to flicker with electricity , and he hardly seemed to notice
in their report , police would explain that only one of the weapons two prongs attached to garcias skin , which might have lessened its effect
they also explained what happened next
get out of here , garcia yelled , and slapped desrochess hand away
the officer activated the device again
and again 10 times in total , police later wrote
but garcia kept squirming , inquiring again and again why he was being removed , as the constant rapid clicking of a high-voltage weapon soundtracked his protests
a woman screamed
a man three seats back craned his neck for a better view
after nearly a minute of zapping , garcia twisted his head free from beneath an officers knee
he looked up at desroches and half-smiled
why am i being removed
officers finally got garcia into handcuffs and cleared the other passengers from the plane
he was walking by the time he emerged from the skybridge , his shirttail half pulled up his torso , and he addressed his fellow passengers as they once again took out their cameras
i need all of you he told the jeering crowd , but was interrupted as officers pushed him into the back of a golf cart
sit
i will sit , garcia said , if you do not push me down.
two officers forced garcias stiff legs to buckle , as if bending a stubborn mannequin , and pressed him into the back of the cart
they used their body weight to press his head down so that , doubled over , his head hung a few inches over the rear bumper as the cart sped away
and still , he yelled
i mean , everyone here is seeing this , garcia said
flight 2446 finally left miami an hour late that night , american said , and the passengers who remained did not see the rest of garcias journey to jail
but it didnt get any easier , as described by police
the arrest report states
desroches , the officer who had ineffectively stunned him on the plane , shifted to lift him up
descroches knocked his hand away , the report says , and turned to prevent garcia from lunging for the gun again
when police finally got him into the squad car , they said , garcia managed to kick a window out of its frame
it will cost $ 150 to repair
the washington post was unable to reach garcia , but cbs chicago spoke to his former legal guardian , phyllis clark , who said he was a straight-a veterinary school student whose usual demeanor was nothing like the man in the videos
