john oliver plans to air trump-mocking public service announcements in which a cowboy explains basic concepts to the president on fox news host sean hannitys show this week , in hopes trump will see them and avoid a nuclear crisis
if youre not familiar with the catheter cowboy ads , oliver introduced them on last week tonight in february last year
theyre parodies of actual ads in which a cowboy hawks pain-free catheters to medicare patients
oliver periodically runs them during the tv-obsessed presidents favorite fox news shows , so that catheter cowboy can inform trump of facts such as frederick douglass is dead , and other people exist.
in the latest ad , oliver told his viewers sunday , the cowboy will address the international iranian nuclear agreement , from which trump has threatened to withdraw by may 12
the historic nuclear deal with iran how it works
as the washington posts fact checker has written , trump has ignored a clause in the deal that permanently bars iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
in olivers psa , set to air in washington during hannitys program this week , the cowboy delivers a somewhat simpler message to the president
the spot begins as a shot-for-shot re-creation of a 2015 ad opposing the iran deal , in which an american family sits down at a dinner table and abruptly disappears in a nuclear explosion
instead of a nuclear fireball , this time the catheter cowboy intrudes on the family , wearing the same plaid shirt and leather vest from his medicare days
hey , there , donald , sorry to interrupt your supper , he says , addressing the camera while the family stares at his back.
im here to tell you the iran deal may not be perfect , but it helps restrict irans ability to start making a bomb for at least 10 years
john oliver wants to directly appeal to trump on health care
so hes buying airtime on fox news
he holds up two posters , a 0 and a 10 , to reinforce the message
he then holds up a third card displaying the face of trumps new national security adviser , john bolton , who founded the nonprofit group that made the original dinner-table ad in 2015
oh , my god , the stove
says the woman behind him just before the dining room explodes in a fireball , as in the original
oliver despaired that the ad may not do much good
but , oliver told his viewers , sending a cowboy to speak to trump between segments of hannity was as close to influencing the president as he could come
trump returns to his first numeric love exaggerating television ratings
john bolton joins trumps as-seen-on-tv administration
