the ice warbled to itself for centuries a discordant song whose verses told the stories of cold winds and shifting snow dunes vibrating across antarctica
it wasnt music as we think of it
days or months might pass between each tonal shift , composed of notes so low and slow they were inaudible to human ears
but if you could lie for 1,000 years on the great ross ice shelf and feel every minute shiver that passed through it if you were snow itself then you would know the chorus
in january 2016 , the song went flat
sped up thousands of times into the frequency range of human hearing , it sounded as though the ices warble faded to something like a dial tone a moaning dirge that lasted for two of the warmest weeks on record for the polar continent
a song that warned of melting snow
when a smaller ice shelf collapsed on the other side of west antarctica in january 2002 , we were blind
nasa wrote in its memorial to that 10,000-year-old platform of ice
but the ice shelf was sick long before its spectacular death
as chaput explained it , the early stages of disintegration are insidious and largely invisible to satellites
repeat heat waves cause the carpet of snow atop the ice shelf to melt and refreeze
with each refreeze , the snow gets harder
eventually , it gets so hard that pools of water form on the snows surface and trickle downward , carving tunnels in the snow to reach the ice beneath
the ice weakens like a rotting boat hull under the meltwaters assault
only near the end is the extent of the damage obvious to satellites , when the entire shelf ice , snow and all breaks apart and dissolves into the ocean within days
this is , to put it mildly , a lousy warning system for the end of the world as we know it
but as chaput and his team demonstrated in a paper published by the american geophysical union last week , a wounded ice shelf will sing about its troubles long before it shows them to us
scientists are slowly unlocking the secrets of the earth 's mysterious hum
the discovery was a complete accident , chaput said
no one expected ice to sing
several years ago , a different team of researchers installed dozens of seismic stations across the ross ice shelf
like many climate scientists , they were concerned that if the france-size plank of floating ice ever collapses like larsen b did in 2002 titanic glaciers behind it would be free to escape the mainland of antarctica , eventually raising ocean levels by several feet
the seismic stations were designed to measure what the earths crust and mantle are doing beneath the ice massive vibrations on the scale of earthquakes
but as chaput reviewed the data set from late 2014 to 2017 , he noticed something in the sine waves a subtle song , vibrating through the top layers of snow
even the movement of a snow dune could alter the frequencies , chaput said
it was as if the entire snow bed were grooved out like an old phonograph record , humming with the rustle of the atmosphere above
the notes hovered around 5 hertz , about a quarter of the lowest frequency human ears can detect
but chaput could easily speed them up enough to hear compressing days-long rhythms into minutes or seconds
thats how he was able to hear what happened in early 2016 when an especially warm summer came to antarctica and the phonograph skipped
scientists stunned by antarctic rainfall and a melt area bigger than texas
chaput didnt discover the great melt event of january 2016
as chris mooney wrote in the washington post , it disturbed scientists who learned of it at the time
the two-week melt left nothing so obvious as a lake on the surface of the ross ice shelf
rather , it turned a patch of snow the size of texas wet and slushy as the air temperature rose to above freezing
scientists detected it at first through the presence of vapor clouds above the ice shelf , mooney wrote , then used microwave satellites to confirm the damage
but in the music of the snow , the melting was impossible to miss
at seismic stations across the ice shelf , the warbling vibrations grew quiet
notes stretched out into a long drone at some locations , like a tornado siren going off
to chaput , it sounded like a two-week-long groan
it doesnt sound super happy to me , he said
all this might simply mean that chaput found a depressing soundtrack for the melting of an ice cap
but as described in his paper , the music also holds potential as a measurement tool something like a sonogram for the health of snow and ice in future warming events , of which he expects many
that does n't mean we 'll like what we hear
the ancient warble of the ross ice shelf returned shortly after the heat wave ended in late january , as watery snow refroze and crystals reforged their bonds
but at many of the listening stations , it no longer sounds the same
the warble now has something like a rasp
he doesnt know whether the ross ice shelf will regain its original structure and voice , or whether its been permanently damaged , as the larsen b ice shelf must have been long before it broke apart
for now , however imperfectly , it continues to sing
