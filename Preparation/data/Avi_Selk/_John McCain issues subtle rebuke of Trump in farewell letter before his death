phoenix in his final words to the nation before his passing , sen. john mccain delivered a veiled rebuke of president trump , calling on americans to rally behind the countrys founding ideals rather than hiding behind walls and succumbing to political tribalism
trump campaigned on a promise to build a wall across the u.s. border with mexico and force mexico to pay for it
the extraordinary letter was a defiant coda to the years-long battle between the two men
trump has said that mccain , who spent more than five years as a pow in vietnam , was not a war hero , and continued to snub the longtime senator throughout his battle with brain cancer
mccain , in turn , pulled no punches in criticizing the president on foreign policy and other issues , most recently in a stinging denunciation of trumps summit with russian president vladimir putin in helsinki last month
flags at the white house were lowered saturday night in honor of mccain , but they were raised monday morning despite the wishes of congressional leaders from both parties
for the second straight day , trump remained silent about mccain in three separate appearances at the white house , the president ignored questions from reporters about the late senator and his legacy
davis said monday that trump will not be attending the funeral or memorial services in washington for mccain and that vice president pence will serve as the administration designee at a ceremony friday at the u.s. capitol rotunda
davis said , declining to reiterate what has already been reported about the mccain familys wishes
in response to another question , davis told reporters that the familys thoughts were solely on mccain
on saturday morning , a funeral procession for mccain will make its way from the u.s. capitol along pennsylvania avenue toward washington national cathedral , with a brief stop at the vietnam veterans memorial to lay a wreath
the service will also include a performance of the irish ballad danny boy by opera singer rene fleming
former vice president joe biden , mccain 's longtime senate colleague , is expected to speak at a separate service for the arizona republican in phoenix on thursday
doug ducey ( r ) has said he will wait until after mccain 's funeral sunday to appoint a successor to serve out the remainder of the senators term through 2020
davis did not weigh in at length monday on the search for a successor , saying only that mccain probably would have wanted to see a hispanic woman take his place
mccains farewell statement did not mention trump by name but refers at some length to the populist and protectionist forces that helped propel trump to the office mccain twice failed to win
white supremacists who marched in charlottesville last year chanted blood and soil , a translation of a nazi slogan
trump appeared to defend the rallygoers , who clashed with counterprotesters , when he said there were fine people on both sides.
mccain also defended the ideals of what came to be known as the liberal world order the post-world war ii architecture of american-led international institutions and alliances that trump often complains have become a burden
mccain was also alarmed by the rise of far-right populism in europe and the british break with the european union that trump has heralded
