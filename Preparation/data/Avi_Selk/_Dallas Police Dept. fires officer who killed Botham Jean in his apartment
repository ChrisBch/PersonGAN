the dallas police department fired officer amber guyger on monday , two weeks after she was charged in the fatal shooting of her neighbor
this contradicted the police chiefs recent statements that she was unable to discipline the officer while a criminal investigation proceeded
guyger allegedly walked into the apartment of the neighbor , botham jean , and fatally shot him sept 6
when she was arrested three days later on manslaughter charges , guyger said she confused jeans home for her own , confused jean for an intruder , and shot him when he refused her commands , according to court documents
the victims family has disputed her account and said she had knocked on jeans door before killing him

after repeated protests , police chief u. rene hall gave contradictory explanations last week for why she could not fire the officer
she told a town hall that local , state and federal laws prohibit me from taking action , according to abc affiliate wfaa
two days later , the dallas morning news reported that police could fire guyger but did not plan to review her employment until a criminal investigation wrapped up probably months away
in a statement , hall said that any disciplinary investigation would risk compromising the criminal case.
that is not a risk i am willing to take , she said
police did not explain what changed by monday , when the department announced that an internal-affairs investigation had been launched and already concluded that guygers arrest was a fireable offense
the officer , who was hired in late 2013 , was terminated during a hearing monday morning for her actions.
why the dallas officer who killed her neighbor might have trouble with a deadly force defense
the statement notes that guyger can appeal her firing
police did not comment on whether hall is still worried that the termination might affect the criminal investigation
as paul wrote for the post , the more significant legal questions are whether guyger is prosecuted as a police officer or civilian and whether a jury decides she acted reasonably in using deadly force
