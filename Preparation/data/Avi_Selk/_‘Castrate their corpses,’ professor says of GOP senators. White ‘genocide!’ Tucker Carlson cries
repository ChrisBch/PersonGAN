c. christine fair would later call the tweet an experiment
not a performance , exactly
not a trap , really
certainly not a genocidal death threat , whatever it looked like at first glance
it looked like this
this is a georgetown university
look at this chorus of entitled white men , the georgetown university associate professor wrote saturday afternoon , meaning the republican senators who were defending supreme court nominee brett m. kavanaugh from sexual assault allegations
all of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps , she wrote
bonus we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine
an experiment , she insisted
a little bait tossed into the wilds of the internet , to see what species of hate it would attract
maybe this was not my most eloquent attempt , fair told the washington post this week , after her twitter account had been suspended , her villainy declared across the conservative media , and her school was fielding questions from reporters
and i will certainly concede i was attempting to make people feel uncomfortable
but this idea im somehow calling for actual violence is preposterous , fair said
i set this up for tucker carlson
he proved my experiment
well , just wait
it escalated in a way i hadnt anticipated , fair said
but i knew exactly where it was going
there was a time before fair was on twitter
there were many years most of her career , actually when she was known on campus simply as a professor of security studies and known around the world as a sober , somewhat hawkish expert on international affairs
even today , fair speaks on panels about the chinese-pakistan economic corridor , and she holds q & as for the council on foreign relations
shes written for the post about the impact of drones on civilians in pakistan
her bio page at georgetown overflows with bibliography and academic distinctions that have nothing to do with her personal blog , which is called tenacious hellpussy a nasty woman posting from the frontlines of f -- -ery
heres what happened , as she explains it
the idea you can effect change by using the normative language expected of someone with a phd is false , fair said
at least , not when youre female
fair would appear on c-span and get marriage proposals in her inbox , she said
she once wrote an op-ed on pakistani policy and received in the mail a seven-by-five array of clitoris cupcakes , all racially distinct
misogyny followed her around like a cloud
anger and frustration built up inside her , exacerbated by what she said was years-long sex abuse as a child
and one day she thought damn it , im done , she said , and decided to let everyone hear what rage sounds like
the idea i am expected to respond to systematic rape culture using florid prose is preposterous , she said
its another way to discipline womens bodies , by asking us to discipline our rage
and so tenacious hellpussy was born
her twitter mug shot became an image of vladimir putin riding a naked , half-pig donald trump
between lectures on international affairs , fair got the white nationalist richard spencer kicked out of his gym and traded accusations of defamation with airport police in germany after they confiscated her deodorant
she provoked confrontations , and wrote hundreds or thousands of words about each one , and a fair percentage of those words were obscene
i confronted richard spencer at my gym
racists do n't get to lift in peace
i aim to create language that creates as much discomfort as i am forced to feel in this regime , fair said , turning back to last weeks kavanaugh hearings
i can not tell you the rage and hurt it feels as all of those men on that judiciary committee kicked sexual assault survivors in the gut
as fairs castrate the corpses tweet pinged around the internet , a reporter for the right-leaning outlet campus reform sent her a perfectly polite email
good afternoon prof. fair , she wrote
i am writing to request a comment for an article
please let me know
fair did comment
specifically , she responded via a furious 2,400-word blog post that addressed the campus reform reporter as aunt lydia , a fictional tv and book character who indoctrinates women to be raped
do you think complicit women and lousy men will be less likely to slut shame you because you are one of their paid-keyboards
no , aunt lydia
and so campus reform published its story about the tweet , and word spread across the internet of a bloodthirsty anti-trump professor who wants to castrate republican senators and will not moderate her rage
it spread from random tweets to reactionary blogs , to major publications and finally to fox news
which fair insists was all according to hypothesis
all part of her experiment
fair has little interest in critiques of her efficacy
try replacing the f-bombs with arguments and i bet your effect will change from incitement of emotions to almost infinite potential for change in behavior and policy , a colleague once suggested , she wrote on her blog
she had tried that for decades , she responded
it never worked
i evaluate the efficacy of my language by a different metric does it make you feel uncomfortable for that is its intent , she wrote
my cynicism is learned from experience
now she tallies up her hate emails by the thousands , breaking them down by category as if they were war medals deeply misogynistic , deeply anti-semitic
saturdays tweet had earned her 800 emails and counting , she told the post , coming every few seconds after tucker carlson said what he said
he said this
tucker carlson just warned his viewers about liberals advocating for white genocide
the fox news host , in some ways threading his own line between provocation and professionalism , launched into his monday-night monologue by reviewing the weekends top liberal outrages
he mentioned a solemn column by matthew dowd , inspired by the ugly kavanaugh hearings , about how us white male christians need to step back and give others room to lead
he did not , notably , advocate for genocide , carlson quipped , just as fairs tweet flashed on the screen
a georgetown professor called christine fair recently did do that
and with that , if fair really had been conducting some social experiment and not simply venting on twitter , she finally reached her conclusion
the myth of white genocide has for years been growing in international racist circles , the idea that the apocryphal white race ( sometimes white culture ) was being destroyed , whether by race mixing or global conspiracy
in recent episodes , carlson had been flogging the issue of land seizures in south africa a known proxy issue for those who believe in white genocide
fairs tweet got him to invoke the term itself
come tuesday morning , fairs castration tweet was fading from the news cycle
twitter had a new trending villain , and it was tucker carlson
today 's hatewatch headlines tucker carlson warns of white genocide teaming up to track alt-right bitcoin wallets reddit quarantines white-nationalist subreddits and more
this is orwellian , carlson wrote in a statement after the southern poverty law center flagged him on its hatewatch list
a georgetown professor publicly calls for killing people based on their race , and then suggests we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine
i criticize this and wind up on a hate watch list
fair , rightly or wrongly , says her rhetoric is designed to cause discomfort , not effect anything as naive as positive change in the world
she has her own repercussions to deal with
the professor woke up tuesday morning to find her twitter account suspended for the first time
it was reactivated in the afternoon , and a twitter spokesman said the suspension had been a mistake
then it was taken offline again , and the spokesman didnt respond to further questions
theyll either un-suspend me or they wont , fair said
twitters a superhighway for the most noxious of individuals
its not the worst thing if im not on twitter again
as for her academic career , fair said she keeps her politics out of her lectures and warns her students not to follow her on social media unless they want to experience that side of her life
georgetown university has stood by the professors right to private speech after previous outbursts and released essentially the same statement to fox news when it asked about fairs saturday tweet
on tuesday , georgetown president john j. degioia wrote in a statement we can and do strongly condemn the use of violent imagery , profanity , and insensitive labeling of individuals based on gender , ethnicity or political affiliation in any form of discourse
if comments made by faculty members are determined to substantially affect their teaching , research or university service , we will address them
im a hard target , fair said
if i get fired , i will become a veterinary tech , a community organizer
so far , she said , the only campus administrators she had heard from about her tweet worked in security some concern over all the hate mail
my dean knows how to reach me , she said
this morning ive been prepping for classes
ive not checked my email because most of it is rubbish.
on this particular tuesday afternoon , most of it was hate mail
she didnt sound upset by this
comforts an acquired thing
