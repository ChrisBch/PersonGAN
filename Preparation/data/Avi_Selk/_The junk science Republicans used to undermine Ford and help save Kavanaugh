the politically convenient , scientifically baseless theory that sexual assault so traumatized christine blasey ford she mixed up her attacker is now something like common wisdom for many republicans
president trump explicitly endorsed the theory saturday , shortly after brett m. kavanaugh was narrowly confirmed as a supreme court judge , telling reporters he was 100 percent sure ford accused kavanaugh in error
its easy to forget that less than three weeks ago , when the mistaken-identity theory was first formulated , it was so widely ridiculed that a pundit who advanced it on twitter subsequently apologized and offered to resign from his job
but for many cognitive researchers who study how memories actually form during traumatic events , the theory never stopped sounding ridiculous
said richard huganir , a neuroscientist at johns hopkins school of medicine.
theres a total consensus in the field of memory ...
if anything , fear and trauma enhances the encoding of the memory at a molecular level
as he and several other researchers told the washington post , being attacked floods the brain with chemicals , including norepinephrine , which helps people remember whatever they are focused on
( ford , a psychologist herself , even mentioned it in her testimony )
unlike kavanaugh , christine blasey ford was a prosecutors dream witness
its essentially the same phenomenon that makes people forever remember what they were doing when planes hit the world trade center on 9/11 , or when they learned john f. kennedy was shot
its such a basic tenet of psychology and cognitive science that some researchers watched the mistaken-identity theory spread through the senate this month with a sense of stunned dismay
said ira hyman , a cognitive psychologist who specializes in traumatic memories at western washington university
sexual assault victims do sometimes misidentify their attackers , he noted , has but those are almost always attacks by strangers when the victims hyperactive memory has no familiar face to etch into the brain
lila davachi , a cognitive neuroscientist at columbia university , analogized the traumatic memory formation process to cranking up the contrast on a photo central details get heightened , while those in the background get washed out
in this case it was a party with friends and she knew him
it is ridiculous to say she wouldnt remember who it was
asked last week if she could have mistaken her attacker , ford testified that she is 100 percent certain it was kavanaugh
trump has mocked her story because of these gaps , but its perfectly consistent with the science of traumatic memory formation
like other researchers , she could not recall a single case of a sexual assault victim misremembering a known attacker save for rare instances in which people , often children , were coached into falsely accusing friends and family members
according to her account , she never forgot about this , mather noted.
she tried to.
also like other researchers , she said kavanaughs memory was more likely to be suspect than fords , if he was as heavy a drinker in high school as many people who knew him have alleged
in fact , collins later explained that she believed ford and kavanaugh were doing just that telling the truth as she weighed their mutually exclusive testimonies
.senatorcollins to danabashcnn what i decided to use as standard was the question of is it more likely than not that brett kavanaugh assaulted christine ford
and there was no corroborating evidence that he did so
the difference between senators and scientists is that collins , like many in her party , resolved the dilemma by assuming a fault in the victims memory
i do believe that she was assaulted , collins told cnn
i dont know by whom , and im not certain when , but i do not believe that he was the assailant.
how well such logic holds up with the lay population could be put to the test as democrats seek to punish kavanaughs backers in the midterm elections and beyond
after collins left the cnn set , sen. mazie hirono ( d-hi ) sat down to say she found the republicans equivocation even more insulting.
was she mistaken
