phoenix laura gallego walked through the deserted wesley bolin memorial plaza after dark , holding a bouquet of roses , feeling slightly embarrassed that she was only one whod thought to do so
john mccain had been her senator since she was a child , growing up in phoenix in the 1980s
she had been eating dinner with her daughters on saturday when news of his death was announced on television
to gallego , mccain represented the best of u.s. politics a blend of kindness and gravity that had all but vanished in the last few years
all she could think to do at that moment was drive to walmart , buy a bouquet and bring it to a sculpture park honoring fallen soldiers and other individuals and events important to arizona
past presidents , political rivals , senate colleagues pay tribute to mccain
but as gallego spoke , a crowd of tv crews had been gathering across the street , around some commotion outside the state capitol building
she walked over and saw a young girl in a gown , clutching a small u.s. flag
she saw david carrasco , 78 , standing at attention beside his jeep in his honor guard uniform for as long i can , he said , because he had served in vietnam too
one by one , mourners drove up from across phoenix to pay their own remembrances
feeling less awkward , gallego found the tallest flag in view and put mccains roses down beside it
some time later and a few miles to the north , mccains hearse arrived at the a.l
moore grimshaw mortuaries
hundreds of people had lined overpasses and thronged to the mortuary to pay their respects
said chuck lehtinen , who had followed mccains political career since the 1970s and made it there in time to witness the senators last ride home
lehtinen and his wife stayed a while after the hearse had disappeared into the funeral home , and even after the police motorcycle escort roared out of the driveway and into the night
they werent alone
dozens lingered with them , many holding hands
two people held a huge u.s. flag aloft in front of the mortuarys front sign , which read in glowing letters dignity.
