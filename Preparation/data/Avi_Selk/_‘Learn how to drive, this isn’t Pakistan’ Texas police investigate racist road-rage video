police in a south texas town are investigating a road-rage incident in which a mans tirade of expletives took a sudden detour down a long , dark road of xenophobia
video is embedded below , but laden throughout with foul language
a censored transcript follows
outside the drivers licensing office in kingsville a small town along texas highway 77 , about 20 miles inland from the gulf of mexico
a man films from the drivers seat of his white sedan , in front of the building
he identified himself to the huffpost as ali alghamdi , a 24-year-old student at texas a & m university , nearly 300 miles north
a dark chevrolet is stopped a few yards ahead of alghamdi
its driver , an unknown man in a cowboy hat , is pacing angrily between the two vehicles
man with hat ( mwh ) you were tailgating me , b-
alghamdi no , you cut off the street
mwh no , no , no , no , you were coming too fast
the man in the cowboy hat walks quickly over to alghamdis window , filling the camera fame
mwh you were tailgating me , b , you were tailgating me , b- , you were tailgating me
alghamdi if you notice , your language is not good
alghamdi im not doing anything
mwh because youre unprintable
the voice of a woman off camera can be heard weakly protesting as the argument escalated
mwh this is america , dumb
alghamdi i know
mwh you got ta learn how to drive
this isnt pakistan
alghamdi if youve got to fight , there is a place we go to
mwh this is not pakistan , afghanistan or kuwait , expletive
alghamdi what , say that again
the hatted man moves up to the window again
man with hat ( mwh ) this is not pakistan , afghanistan or kuwait
we have rules in this country
alghamdi why do you say pakistan
mwh turning around
because you sound like an expletive , a expletive arab
alghamdi calling after him
where are you from , sir
mwh america , b
get it straight
alghamdi what about your heritage
mwh america
alghamdi your grandparents
mwh pointing down to the parking lot
im from here expletive my grandparents are from here , expletive
alghamdi not mexico
mwh no , no mexico , spanish expletive
alghamdi , who could not be reached for comment , uploaded his video from the may 3 altercation to youtube , and subsequently gave an interview to huffpost that published on monday
the rise and humiliating fall of chris cantwell , charlottesvilles starring fascist
the student started to record around that point , he told the outlet
he said he feared that the man might be armed though nothing more than a wallet chain can be seen at his waist in the video , which continues as alghamdi discovers the hatted man can curse in spanish
alghamdi youre not latin
man with hat ( mwh ) youre in south texas
if you dont speak spanish , youre a dumb expletive
alghamdi i know spanish
mwh okay , then
does that make you a mexican
alghamdi thats not my question
look , im being respectful
mwh no youre expletive tailgating being an idiot
a more traditional road rage argument follows about who did what at a stop sign , or who cut off who
as with the previous footage , alghamdi invariably remains calm , and the other man is invariably screaming
bradley lile , a lieutenant with the kingsville police department , said an officer responded to the location afterward and spoke to the student
the department plans to file a disorderly conduct case against the other man , who has not been named , in court on wednesday
as in those cases , no violence takes place in alghamdis video
it concludes as the hatted man leaves the student and storms into the government building , with one more racially tinged volley of anger
mwh learn how to drive , expletive
alghamdi have a nice day
alghamdi muchas gracias
mwh unprintable , in spanish
