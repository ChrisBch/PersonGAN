in the beginning , the rules of the space bar were simple
two spaces after each period
that made sense in the age of the typewriter
letters of uniform width looked cramped without extra space after the period
typists learned not to do it
but then , at the end of the 20th century , the typewriter gave way to the word processor , and the computer , and modern variable-width fonts
and the world divided
some insisted on keeping the two-space rule
they could n't get used to seeing just one space after a period
it simply looked wrong
some said this was blasphemy
the designers of modern fonts had built the perfect amount of spacing , they said
anything more than a single space between sentences was too much

( and yes , she double-spaced it )
this schism has actually existed throughout most of typed history , the writer and type enthusiast james felici once observed ( in a single-spaced essay )
the rules of spacing have been wildly inconsistent going back to the invention of the printing press
the original printing of the u.s
declaration of independence used extra long spaces between sentences
john baskerville 's 1763 bible used a single space
trends went back and forth between continents and eras for hundreds of years , felici wrote.it 's not a good look
and that 's just english

that would be insanity
or at least ,
enter three psychology researchers from skidmore college , who decided it 's time for modern science to sort this out once and for all
they wrote in a paper published last week in the journal attention , perception , & psychophysics
they cite dozens of theories and previous research , arguing for one space or two
a 2005 study that found two spaces reduced lateral interference in the eye and helped reading
a 2015 study that found the opposite
a 1998 experiment that suggested it did n't matter
so the researchers , rebecca l. johnson , becky bui and lindsay l. schmitt , rounded up 60 students and some eye-tracking equipment , and set out to heal the divide
first , they put the students in front of computers and dictated a short paragraph , to see how many spaces they naturally used
turns out , 21 of the 60 were two-spacers , and the rest typed with close-spaced sentences that would have horrified the founding fathers
the researchers then clamped each student 's head into place , and used an eyelink 1000 to record where they looked as they silently read 20 paragraphs
the paragraphs were written in various styles one-spaced , two-spaced , and strange combinations like two spaces after commas , but only one after periods
and vice versa , too
and the verdict was two spaces after the period is better
it makes reading slightly easier
congratulations , yale university professor nicholas a. christakis
sorry , lifehacker
science vindicates my longstanding practice , learned at age 12 , of using two spaces after periods in text
not one space
text is easier to read that way
of course , on twitter , i use one space , given 280 characters
actually , lifehacker 's one-space purist nick douglas pointed out some important caveats to the study 's conclusion
most notably , the test subjects read paragraphs in courier new , a fixed-width font similar to the old typewriters , and rarely used on modern computers
johnson , one of the authors , told douglas that the fixed-width font was standard for eye-tracking tests , and the benefits of two-spacing should carry over to any modern font
douglas found more solace in the fact that the benefits of two-spacing , as described in the study , appear to be very minor
reading speed only improved marginally , the paper found , and only for the 21 two-spacers , who naturally typed with two spaces between sentences
the majority of one-spacers , on the other hand , read at pretty much the same speed either way
and reading comprehension was unaffected for everyone , regardless of how many spaces followed a period
the major reason to use two spaces , the researchers wrote , was to make the reading process smoother , not faster
everyone tended to spend fewer milliseconds staring at periods when a little extra blank space followed it
( putting two spaces after a comma , if you 're wondering , slowed down reading speed , so do n't do that )
but no sooner did the paper publish than the researchers discovered that science does n't necessarily govern matters of the space bar
johnson told lifehacker that she and her co-authors submitted the paper with two spaces after each period as was proper
and the journal deleted all the extra spaces anyway
note an earlier version of this story published incorrectly because , seriously , putting two spaces in the headline broke the web code
