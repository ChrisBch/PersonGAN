after dozens of people fled a thanksgiving evening shooting inside an alabama mall stampeding through the food court and hiding inside stores one woman told reporters that she said a prayer as she ran give the police wisdom and accuracy of shots
at first , it seemed the prayer was answered
police in hoover soon announced they had secured the riverchase galleria and killed the gunman , whom they named as 21-year-old emantic fitzgerald bradford jr
speaking to reporters who were outside the mall , police said bradford shot a teenager during a fight near the food court , wounded a 12-year-old girl with a stray bullet and brandished his pistol at the uniformed officer who killed him
thank god we had our officers very close , police chief nick derzis told al.com
they heard the gunfire , they engaged the subject , and they took out the threat
the next day it become clear that police missed something
as black friday crowds streamed through the mall in the morning , a reporter with fox affiliate wbrc posted a photo of a pistol lying on the floor of the santas village display
in the evening , police released a statement we regret that our initial media release was not totally accurate , but new evidence indicates that it was not
the statement said , new evidence now suggests that while mr. bradford may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation , he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old victim
this information indicates that there is at least one gunman still at-large
police , who claimed earlier that bradford had threatened responding officers with a pistol , said other people appeared to be involved in the shooting
they say at least one of those people apparently escaped while bradford died on the concourse outside a shoe store , surrounded by officers
that was not his character at all , bradfords mother , april pipkins , told the new york times
the police department did not respond over the weekend to questions about whether bradford had a role in the shooting and about the search for the person who shot the teen and the girl
the alabama law enforcement agency , which has taken over the investigation , planned to release a statement on sunday
ej bradford leaves today for basic training and ait for 12b ... ..good luck ej
bradford had posted on facebook photos of himself in an army uniform
he described himself as a combat engineer
a spokesman for the army , however , told the washington post that he never completed advanced individual training and so did not serve
an attorney for bradfords family said he had been honorably discharged from the army
he lived just outside birmingham , a few miles from the mall where he was shot
he was a super sweet , funny , kind and good-hearted young man who never had a bad word to say to anyone , his former catholic high school teacher carl dean told the hoover sun
about an hour before the shooting , bradford had posted on facebook a photo of him posing in a doorway wearing the shredded jeans and t-shirt in which he would die
digital scribbles on the photo obscure his left hand , in which he appears to be holding something
bradfords parents and a family attorney say he had a concealed-handgun license , which is not unusual in alabama
the galleria , which advertises itself as the states largest indoor mall , prohibits firearms on site , according to its website
but state law is broadly permissive of gun rights , according to al.com , and its unclear whether the mall has the public signs and security measures that are required for businesses to enforce a firearm ban
the first volley of gunfire broke out on the second floor of the mall shortly before 10 p.m. , according to police and witness accounts
cellphone videos show people fleeing through the food court , knocking over a cash register and cowering in employee backrooms
an unidentified 18-year-old was shot and reported to be in serious condition at a hospital

in this chaos , al.com reported , several shoppers were seen with their guns drawn
it is unclear where bradford was during the shooting
two uniformed police officers working as security guards intercepted him in front of a shoe store on the second level , where a photo posted online shows him lying on the tile with blood pooled around his head
while moving toward the shooting scene , one of the officers encountered a suspect brandishing a pistol and shot him , police said in a statement written immediately after the shooting
in a revised statement , they said bradford was fatally shot while fleeing the shooting scene while brandishing a handgun
in videos taken outside the shoe store , shoppers watch in astonishment
