paulden , ariz. midway through her statewide bus tour , republican u.s. senate candidate kelli ward alights at a desert shooting range and spends a few minutes firing an ar-15 for the benefit of several dozen supporters , volunteers and news crews in her entourage
her newly minted campaign surrogate , the professional conspirator and far right internet presence mike cernovich , is on the other side of a clearing about as far from wards photo op as he can be without actually abandoning the event
between volleys of gunfire , he tries to explain the difference between the conspiracy theories and far-right memes he has helped send viral , and those he actually believes in
its usually a hazy distinction
once , a candidate would run from appearing with a surrogate like cernovich
but ward is blunt about why she invited such a man to join her struggling primary campaign against former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio and rep. martha mcsally
( the senate seat is currently held by the retiring republican jeff flake )
when cernovich stepped off the bus at the gun range , wards emcee introduced him as a gentleman who has lots of followers on the internet.
this is cernovichs first political appearance , and rural arizona is clearly not his natural element
as he walks up a gravel road toward the bus , cernovich seems unconcerned about whether he helps or hurts wards campaign , even if helping it would seem to be the point
cernovich is in back with the other campaign surrogates out of sight when the reporters climb aboard to find ward and an aide in the buss front cabin , ready to field questions
she told the post at an earlier event attended by about 100 people in her hometown of lake havasu city
the bus ride to phoenix will take more than 2.5 hours , and its only a few minutes before a reporter brings up cernovich the man in the back
ward says carefully
conspiracy theories , says the cnn reporter
well , youll have to talk to him , ward says
about the syrian gassing being a hoax , she offers , there is evidence out there we have to explore.
ward eventually goes to the back of the bus to interact with her surrogates , but it takes a while before she finds anything to say to cernovich , who is seated in the corner , alternately twiddling his thumbs or looking at his phone
finally , she turns to cernovich in what may be his first public interaction with a national politician
this sends cernovich off on a profanity-laced speech about victims of certain wars he believes were waged based on lies spread in the news
ward nods and says , i get that all that time.
then she leaves to greet some supporters who have waved down the bus
for the remainder of the trip to phoenix , they do not speak
ward stays mostly in the front room , chatting with lahren about veterans medical care and how , she says , i want to be somebody people believe in.
cernovich sits mostly in the back , fighting stage fright for the speech hell have to give in phoenix , and wondering aloud why people keep bringing up old tweets he has forgotten writing
the only tweets i feel bad about are the fat-chick ones , he says , referring to one of his pre-pizzagate incarnations when he was involved in the gamergate movement , which attacked female video-game developers
during his introspection , cernovich checks his twitter feed to see that a leading proponent of the viral qanon conspiracy theory has just posted a photo taken with president trump in the oval office
he laughs for a long time
cernovich does not subscribe to qanon , even though it is partly an outgrowth of the pizzagate-pedophilia ring rumors he once actively promoted
he thinks for a moment and concludes but i can understand people would be terrified.
