trump keeps tweeting
neighbors knew robert bowers as a truck driver who rarely hosted visitors but exchanged pleasantries as he came and went from his first-floor apartment in a complex in baldwin , a suburb on the south side of pittsburgh
his unremarkable facade made the role authorities say he played in the massacre that left 11 dead all the more chilling , they said
the lives lost in the pittsburgh synagogue shooting
investigators on sunday finished searching bowerss home as they continued sorting through the only public clues of the hate he seems to have harbored online screeds written under bowerss name that hinted at a radical turn over the last year
authorities on sunday also identified the 11 victims they allege he gunned down inside tree of life synagogue
the dead included a 97-year-old woman , a husband and wife , and two brothers , all of whom were at saturday-morning services when the gunman burst through an open door with three pistols and an ar-15 semiautomatic rifle and began shooting , authorities said
theyre committing genocide to my people , bowers told a swat officer after being shot and captured , according to a federal criminal complaint released sunday.
i just want to kill jews.
pittsburgh mayor bill peduto called the attack the darkest day of pittsburghs history.
he also disputed president trumps suggestion that the synagogue should have had armed guards
an attack on a tight-knit jewish community has left it shellshocked
peduto made his comments as the nation debated whether coarse , often degrading , political rhetoric and conspiracy theories are a root cause of the violent acts that have taken center stage at the end of a heated campaign season
the mass killing did little to abate it democrats on sunday said trumps incendiary attacks on rivals have created fertile ground for those inclined toward extremism , while trump and his allies defiantly blamed the media and liberal activists for fomenting unrest

federal prosecutors in pennsylvania have asked the justice department for approval to seek the death penalty , a decision that ultimately will rest with attorney general jeff sessions , a department spokesman said sunday
the attack , the deadliest on jews in u.s. history , targeted a congregation that is an anchor of pittsburghs large and close-knit jewish community , a synagogue about a 25-minute drive from bowerss home
neighbors said he moved into the apartment at the modest two-story complex where rents for some units are $ 600 a month about two years ago
when he moved in , bowers told owens that he was a truck driver and didnt expect to spend much time in his one-bedroom apartment , she said

owens said bowers would say hello to her from time and time while outside smoking a cigarette
she never saw him with guests
owens said local police and federal agents knocked on doors at the apartment complex about 1 p.m. saturday and asked all the tenants to evacuate
owens , who always parked her car next to bowerss teal hyundai , said she last saw him a few days ago when they were warming up their vehicles after a fall frost
owenss fiance , chris hall , said bowers dressed casually and would sometimes leave his television on well past midnight
bowers was a frequent visitor at the home of cindy odorisio about 10 minutes away , neighbors there said
neighbors said she and bowers were relatives , though their precise relationship was unclear
john boff , 58 , who lives across the street from odorisio , said she lives in the house with a disabled son
boff said bowers sometimes stayed for extended periods
neighbors assumed bowers was a caretaker for the disabled man
members of a facebook group for alumni of baldwin high school in pittsburgh said in postings that bowers attended their high school in the late 1980s
one classmate recalled him as troubled , and another wrote that he was a loner who often wore a green military jacket
others said they could not recall him
one posted a yearbook photo showing him with shoulder-length hair and a t-shirt
alumni who could be reached by phone declined to comment
police in the pittsburgh suburb of dormont , where bowers lived for a time , told the pittsburgh post-gazette that they had a number of contacts with bowers beginning in the 1990s through 2004

suspected synagogue shooter appears to have railed against jews , refugees online
many of his rants expressed racism against african americans , according to an analysis of posts gathered by the network contagion research institute , a group of scientists and engineers who study online hate
half a dozen of bowerss posts included slurs against women who had relationships with black men
he uploaded many posts that referenced nooses and ropes and hanging
nearly 20 posts used the n-word
earlier this month , he reposted a meme about libertarians who have joined the alt-right movement , which includes white nationalists
the meme is a cartoon figure who muses that he was a conservative libertarian only one year ago but now insists on mass executing these marxist degenerates.
the libertarian-to-far-right pipeline is a real thing , the post said
