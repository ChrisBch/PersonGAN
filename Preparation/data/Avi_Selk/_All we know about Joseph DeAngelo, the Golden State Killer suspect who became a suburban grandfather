and if deangelo is the killer police say his dna proves that he is then he fit these 45 suspected rapes and 12 suspected murders into an astonishing double life
he was a vietnam war veteran before the spree , a police officer during the spree , and then a husband , father and grandfather who lived quietly among the same communities that the golden state killer had terrorized
deangelo lived like that apparently free of suspicion until tuesday , when a break in the case led fbi agents and police to arrest the 72-year-old in the sacramento suburb where he raised a family
here is what we know about deangelos life
reads a 1973 article in the exeter sun , announcing that the 27-year-old navy veteran had recently joined exeters police force
the foothills sun-gazette republished the article this week , complete with a photo of a young deangelo clean-shaven and light-haired , like the man who would years later appear in police sketches across the united states
the new officers bona fides looked good when he came to exeter , which is in central california , midway between sacramento and los angeles
deangelo had lived in the state since his late teens , according to the sacramento bee raised by a dennys waitress and a welder
he had served as a repairman on the uss canberra in the late 1960s during the vietnam war , according to local newspaper reports
he lost a finger before leaving the military , one of his neighbors told the bee
exeters current police chief said he has been unable to find any records of deangelos employment , but newspaper reports from the time show he joined the police force in may 1973 , after obtaining a criminal justice degree from california state university
that november , the rookie officer married sharon marie huddle , the bee reported
her brother , james huddle , told oxygen that the couple raised three daughters before eventually separating
while deangelo went about his police work and started a family in exeter , the town of visalia about 10 miles away experienced a rash of strange burglaries and a still-unsolved death
between 1974 and 1976 , a man dubbed the visalia ransacker invaded 85 homes and may have killed a college professor , according to the visalia times delta
the man had a habit of taking tokens such as jewelry , and placed dishes in the homes as noise alarms which would both become trademarks of the golden state killer later on
the newspaper reported that visalia police are now working with other agencies to determine if deangelo was the ransacker and whether , as many have suspected over the years , those break-ins were the warm-up crimes of a future serial killer
no suspicion fell on deangelo while he was living in exeter , however
he patrolled there until 1976 when he moved north and took a job with the auburn police department , about 35 miles outside sacramento
it was in those same sacramento suburbs , that same summer , that the golden state killer started to rape women in their homes
by 1979 , people in sacramento county lived in dread of the man they called the east area rapist
the man was as meticulous as he was violent , los angeles magazine wrote in a profile , often casing houses before his assaults studying floor layouts , disabling locks and lights and hiding weapons
in the rare cases when he was caught in the act , he could jump roofs and vault fences to escape
she stalked the golden state killer until she died
some think her work led to the suspects arrest
as police in surrounding suburbs were searching in vain for a break in the case , deangelo went about his patrols in auburn
he caught a prowling teenager attempting to toilet paper a patrol car in 1978 , the auburn journal reported
deangelo made the newspaper again a few months later , after upsetting a resident by having her car towed
then , in the summer of 1979 , deangelo made the front page repeatedly
the journal wrote in the first of several stories
a clerk at the pay n save in citrus heights an inner suburb of sacramento had found the items in deangelos pants , then struggled with him
sheriffs deputies arrived to find the officer tied to a chair , the journal wrote in a subsequent story , reportedly in an emotional state.
deangelo was fired from the police force that august
two months later he was found guilty of shoplifting , fined $ 100 and sentenced to probation
coincidentally or not , the end of deangelos career in law enforcement was followed by a radical shift in the habits of east area rapist
the rapist abruptly ended his spree around sacramento near the end of 1979 , according to los angeles magazine
he soon reappeared in southern california , where people would call him the original night stalker and eventually the golden state killer because he stopped leaving his victims alive
the final killing took place after a five-year hiatus , in 1986 , when an 18-year-old woman was raped and bludgeoned in irvine , near los angeles , and the golden state killer disappeared
by then , the bee reported , deangelo had been living for three years in a ranch-style house in citrus heights the same sacramento suburb where hed been caught shoplifting
he would spend most of the rest of his life in that city , surrounded by the same communities the east area rapist had terrorized
deangelo took a warehouse job at save mart , a grocery-store chain , in the late 1980s or early 1990s , and worked there for the next 27 years
jason calhoon told the bee that he and deangelo had worked together since the warehouse opened in 1989
he was a regular joe , calhoon said even though he never smiled
his brother-in-law , james huddle , told oxygen that deangelo was a good father.
according to neighbors , a daughter and granddaughter had been living with him in citrus heights until his arrest this week
in contrast to his tidy home , several neighbors said , deangelo himself was prone to fits of rage and occasionally disturbing intrusions into their lives
these rages went back decades , gorman said to 1994 , when deangelo left a voice mail threatening to deliver a load of death if the familys dog didnt stop barking
another neighbor , eddy verdon , told the washington post that three years ago he heard someone on his property , and opened his garage door to find deangelo mounting a bicycle to flee
but the portly grandfather had calmed down in the past few years , she said
he was even well liked by some on the block
cory harvey , who lived next door , told the bee that deangelo helped pay to put a fence between their houses , and would always apologize when she overheard him cursing
even those neighbors most wary of deangelo were stunned by what police now allege that he was the monster who terrorized california in the 1970s and 1980s
deangelo did not seem to expect the police , either
a former sacramento county sheriffs office detective , who investigated some of the first rapes in the case , told the post that he was never a suspect in those years
deangelo had been working in his garage on tuesday afternoon , the bee reported building a table , according to one neighbor
unknown to him , an as-yet-unexplained break in the case had caused police to put him under surveillance , and secretly acquire a dna sample they said matched to the rapes and killings
one neighbor saw several cars pull up to deangelos house in the late afternoon , and armored police pour out of them
deangelo seemed surprised , the ap wrote , but surrendered without incident
deputies reportedly told him he was being charged with multiple murders , and he told them he had a roast in the oven
