pittsburgh even some of president trumps critics had to admit his visit tuesday was respectful
a solemn tour of tree of life synagogue with his family a quiet conversation with the rabbi who escaped saturdays mass shooting there a private meeting with a widow
flowers for the dead , a visit to a hospital , and then trump departed pittsburgh without a single public statement let alone one of the bombastic speeches so many had feared he would bring to this city in mourning
but that was tuesday
on wednesday , trump was back in washington , back on twitter , and back to recasting all events in his immediate wake as a victory story for donald trump
melania and i were treated very nicely yesterday in pittsburgh
the office of the president was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day
we were treated so warmly
small protest was not seen by us , staged far away
the fake news stories were just the opposite-disgraceful
this sign about sums up the attitude of every pittsburgh resident i talked to today
by the time air force one arrived at pittsburgh international airport , the protest had swelled to about 2,000 people
trump traveled from the airport toward pittsburghs predominantly jewish squirrel hill neighborhood with a small entourage , mostly his immediate family and aides
the protest waiting in squirrel hill was rather better attended
said lisa tamres in the swollen crowd that afternoon.
why he thought he would be welcome.
police cars rolled ahead of the throng of marchers and stopped them a block away from the synagogue
on the other side of the police barricade , trump and his family lit candles and placed stones and flowers on the memorials for the 11 victims
the president did not go into the section of the building that police had found strewn with blood and bullet casings three days earlier
myers , the tree of life rabbi , had declared the previous evening at a vigil for his dead congregants that words of hate are unwelcome in pittsburgh.
many in pittsburgh shared the rabbis sentiment and extended it to mean trump was unwelcome in their city
the alleged gunman , after all , had echoed the presidents language about migrant invaders on social media hours before the massacre blaming the invasion on jews
on tuesday , the rabbi spoke with trump at some length behind a row of memorials , then shook his hand goodbye
what they said to each other could not be heard by news cameras in the distance , whose microphones recorded only the occasional shouts of the passing protest
the protesters symbolically turned their backs toward the president when they approached the synagogue , and a group of them later sat down in the middle of the street , as if to block the path of his departing motorcade
they sang songs in hebrew and held up black strips of paper to symbolize lives ripped apart , and chanted
but its likely that trump was truthful when he tweeted that he never saw the demonstration
police wouldnt allow the march to come near the synagogue , and trumps motorcade took a different route when it departed for a hospital , where the president visited police officers wounded in the shooting
of the small , impromptu crowds trump would have seen along the way , a few even cheered him
the protest turned from the synagogue and marched back to where it started
of the hundreds of people who participated , there were jews , muslims , christians , activists and families
whatever trump saw of it or didnt , it was not small
trumps visit to pittsburgh after synagogue massacre creates tensions in grieving city
