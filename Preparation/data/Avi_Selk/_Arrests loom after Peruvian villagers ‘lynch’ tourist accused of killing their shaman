five years ago , sebastian woodroffe decided to quit his job and leave his home in canada and travel thousands of miles to the amazon rain forests to study the healing rituals of indigenous shamans
a relatives battle with alcoholism inspired the then-36-year-old father to go , woodroffe explained in a youtube video
he was particularly interested in ayahuasca , a sludgelike hallucinogenic potion that some peruvians call the sacred vine of the soul , and that many tourists believe can heal anything from depression to childhood trauma
while its not entirely clear what happened to woodroffe in perus rain forests over the next five years , a friend in canada told the canadian broadcasting corp. that he returned from his ayahuasca retreats troubled and more distant
but he kept going back , until late last week
that , peruvian authorities say , is when villagers accused woodroffe of killing a celebrated and beloved local shaman who refused to treat him , and put his face on an amateur wanted poster
then a mob caught him , tied a cord around his neck and made a video of him being dragged through the dirt until he died
perus attorney general ordered the arrest of two suspects in woodroffes death monday , the associated press reported , and has not accused the canadian of any crime
but prosecutors are now investigating both woodroffes lynching and the unsolved shooting of the 81-year-old shaman , olivia arvalo lomas and how and whether the two deaths are linked
in the shipibo-konibo tribe
lately , business has been good for a shaman
each year , thousands of tourists from the united states , australia and canada travel to the peruvian amazon to experiment with ayahuasca , also known as yage
the potion contains dimethyltryptamine , a powerful hallucinogen that is legal in peru only as part of spiritual exercises
but the potion has a dark side , too
in 2015 , the national post reported , a british man took ayahuasca during a peruvian retreat , began screaming at the top of his lungs and tried to attack another tourist with a butcher knife
the tourist killed the british man in self-defense , the paper wrote one of several violent incidents linked to ayahuasca tourism , even before arvalo was fatally shot during a ritual last week
her family said woodroffe held the gun
his friend yarrow willard told the canadian broadcasting corp. , but is very much a gentle person underneath all that.
he grew up on vancouver island , willard said , and worked odd jobs in recent years between his trips to peru
willard told the cbc
and even though woodroffe had become more distant after trying ayahuasca , and would return from his retreats in peru seeming troubled , willard could not believe his friend capable of violence
in his online fundraising campaign to study in peru , woodroffe spoke of wanting to make several trips to the amazon and learn spanish so he could better befriend and learn from its indigenous inhabitants
woodroffe wrote specifically of arvalos tribe
he wanted to protect the tribe from modern industrial forces to preserve their eroding perch in the amazon.
acceptance of their wisdoms potency will bring value to the shipibo , he wrote
and while his fundraiser fell far short of its $ 10,000 goal , woodroffe had apparently been able to make repeated trips since 2013
by last week he was in the remote ucayali region of northeastern peru , among the tribe
there , villagers told the bbc , he met arvalo and asked for her guidance
and there , on thursday , the old shaman was shot dead outside her home
accounts of arvalos death conflict wildly
a prosecutor said no one witnessed it , and no weapon was found , according to the bbc
but residents told an indigenous news outlet that witnesses saw woodroffe shoot arvalo multiple times after she sang an ikaro , or curing song
the shamans family claimed she had refused to conduct a ritual with ayahuasca for the canadian , the bbc wrote , provoking his rage
when residents could not find woodroffe after the shooting , a crude wanted bulletin circulated online

it would not take long to find him
arvalos killing spurred outrage within her tribe and across peru , particularly in light of many recent unsolved killings of environmental and human rights activists in the region
the amazon was cited in a 2016 study by the environmental watchdog group global witness as one of the regions worldwide with the most killings of activists , particularly indigenous activists often over disputes about mining , logging , dams and other hallmarks of industrialization
residents of arvalos town were particularly frustrated about a double standard in the way indigenous people were treated in the criminal justice system , local residents told peruvian news broadcasters
they were angry at the tourists
there is justice for those with money , one local resident told tv peru
a woman told a peruvian vice minister on tv , the weekend after arvalos death
and other leads
that didnt matter to the mob that caught woodroffe
most of the onlookers stare silently
one loops a cord around woodroffes neck and drags him from the puddle onto the grass and then across the grass until he stops moving
woodroffes body was found in a makeshift grave over the weekend , less than a mile from arvalos home
an autopsy revealed that he had been beaten , then strangled , prosecutors told reuters
perus interior ministry released a statement vowing to aggressively investigate his killing and that of the shaman
its unclear whether the two suspects ordered arrested in the lynching have been caught , and the associated press reported that investigators are studying woodroffes body to find out whether he really did kill the shaman from whom he had once hoped to learn
lead prosecutor ricardo palma jimenez told a peruvian news station , but not justice by their own hands.
