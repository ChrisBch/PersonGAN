actually , not yet that might be too much too soon
let 's start with the basics of the international space station 's toilet
here it is , like a wet vac crammed into a fridge
said toilet was installed on the american side of the iss in 2008
a curtain was added shortly afterward
then it flooded
fortunately , there 's a second toilet on the russian side , though it sometimes breaks , too , leaving the astronauts to go inside their shuttles or , as a last resort , to use what is euphemistically called an apollo bag.
we 're just saying it could be much worse
you 'll notice that someone has decorated the cubicle with a cartoon of an astronaut and an outhouse
it 's probably important to keep your sense of humor when using this toilet
someone has also posted handwritten notes around the stall , because carefully following instructions will be very important , too
the best part of the toilet , or the least-terrible part of it , is the peeing apparatus
it 's just a funnel , a hose and a vacuum , but it 's relatively easy to use , and the pee goes into a state-of-the-art recycling system that turns it back into water
that 's kind of cool
the worst part is pooping
the worst thing in all of space may be pooping
pooping in deep space has nasa stumped
the space poop challenge is your way to help
a european space agency astronaut once explained how the toilet works in a youtube demonstration ( do n't worry safe for work )
under the best of circumstances , you hover over the wet vac-looking thing and poop into a plastic bag lining a small hole at the top
the video made it seem easy , but it 's not easy to aim poop in zero gravity
you 're trying to hit a pretty small target , whitson told business insider last week , as prelude to her horror story
her fellow nasa astronauts have to practice the technique before they leave earth using training toilets , and an alarmingly positioned video camera to help line things up
and there are accidents , said whitson , who has spent two years of her life in space
free-floating poop has been a hazard of space travel since the days of the moon landings
but , okay , so you successfully poop into the hole and push the bag into the wet vac , separated by a thin curtain from the rest of a space station and the 250-mile void between it and earth
no one is going to recycle that poop
the best thing nasa knows to do with it is to shoot it out of the international space station and let it burn up in earth 's atmosphere like a shooting star
do not make a wish
a nasa astronaut films his spacewalk and a breathtaking view of earth
but the poop ca n't just be launched into space immediately
doing anything in space is difficult and expensive it reportedly cost $ 19 million just to build the fridge toilet , flushing not included
per the european space agency , the poop just sits inside the toilet until mass disposal which is every 10 days or so
if you 've ever used a port-a-potty on the last day of a music festival , you can imagine what the toilet on a crowded space station is like after more than a week
and so , not pictured in the youtube video , is a final procedure that whitson revealed with a grimace to business insider
she said , and pack it down.
this is not to say that 21st century space travel is all bad
far from it
but then you turn around , and there 's the $ 19 million wet vac and funnel , and it 's been a week since the last trash day and that space poop needs squishing
an astronauts surprisingly helpful guide to pooping in space
here comes your own little place in space
