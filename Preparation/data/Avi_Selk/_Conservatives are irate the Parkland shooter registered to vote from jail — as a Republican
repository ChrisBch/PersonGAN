a father of a parkland school shooting victim appeared on fox & friends over the weekend and suggested , without evidence , that democrats registered the accused shooter to vote from jail as part of an effort to steal floridas election
said andrew pollack , whose daughter meadow was one of 17 people nikolas cruz allegedly shot and killed at marjory stoneman douglas high school in february.
its never been done in 20 years.
they probably shouldnt be voting anyway , foxs katie pavlich remarked after listening to pollacks accusations , which neither she nor her two co-hosts challenged at any point , although they contradicted all public evidence
he registered as a republican , which fox & friends didnt mention
there is nothing suspicious or mysterious about what cruz did from his cell
in general , jail inmates are constitutionally entitled to register and vote before their trials , assuming no prior convictions or legal disqualifications
broward county records show that in 2016 and previous elections , several inmates did exactly that from the same jail where cruz now sits
the fox hosts were buying into a grieving fathers statements , she added.
pollack , who has vocally supported school security reform and republican politicians since his daughters death , could not be reached for comment
since discovering cruzs voter registration on twitter on saturday , the father has claimed that the broward county sheriff and elections supervisor both democrats planned it in an effort to steal the senate election from gov
rick scott , who holds a razor-thin lead over democrat sen. bill nelson as the state heads into a recount
i 'm sick to my stomach
18-1958 murdered 17 students & staff , including my daughter meadow
yet in july , broward sheriff scottjisrael let people into the jail to get him & other animals registered to vote.the despicable democrats have no shame.ca n't let them steal this election
its unclear how registering a single inmate as a republican , to boot would help democrats swing the election
pollack has provided no evidence that anyone was sent to the jail to assist cruz , who simply had to obtain an application , fill it out and mail it to the county elections office to receive a ballot and vote by mail
said christopher uggen , a university of minnesota sociology professor who studies the disenfranchisement of prisoners
sheriffs can make it more difficult or easier for prisoners to vote , he noted
if inmates have internet access , they can simply download and print a registration form
uggen said the american civil liberties union and other groups hold voter registration drives in some jails , when authorities let them
on the other end of the spectrum , the center for american progress reported last year about a lawsuit against an indiana sheriff , claiming jail inmates werent properly informed that they had the right to vote
uggen didnt know what the situation was like inside cruzs jail
the broward county sheriffs spokeswoman , coleman-wright , said simply that the department serves as a mail courier between inmates and the elections office
floridas move to allow ex-felons to vote brings u.s. closer to international election norms
it didnt seem to be an issue in years past
but then , that single killing wasnt a national tragedy
and gordons registration didnt intersect with a brutally contested midterm election in which republican candidates and the president of the united states has leveled baseless accusations of voter fraud
oh my gosh
i dont even have the words for this
the image of cruzs registration spread virally through a contextless vacuum
somewhere along the way , someone cropped the image so that it appeared on far-right facebook groups with the defendants republican affiliation cut off
all the better to blame it on democrats
from minnesota where he advocates for inmates to have more voting access , not less uggen said he wasnt much surprised by any of it
floridas move to allow ex-felons to vote brings u.s. closer to international election norms
allowing felons to vote likely would have changed the result in floridas senate race
