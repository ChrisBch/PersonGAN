one of britains most notorious anti-muslim campaigners was arrested for disrupting a trial last week and was sentenced that same day to a year in prison , which the judge ordered news media not to report on
the gag order backfired , turning english defense league founder tommy robinson into a sort of free-speech martyr to conservatives such as donald trump jr. and roseanne barr before the gag order was lifted tuesday

robinson had been arrested multiple times before last week , for crimes including fraud and assault , according to leeds live , and twitter has permanently banned him for claiming that islam is murderous
but robinson has continued to live-stream video rants to hundreds of thousands of viewers
he tends to film outside courthouses , where he often claims muslims on trial are representative of their religion
its illegal in britain to report the details of some trials before they conclude a long-standing law designed to prevent the news from biasing juries and causing prosecutions to collapse , according to leeds live
robinson was convicted of breaking that law last year , the bbc wrote , when he tried to film defendants outside a trial in canterbury
his three-month sentence was suspended at the time , but the judge warned him that another offense would send him to prison
nevertheless , robinson kept filming
he was arrested and released after trying to video muslims at a trial in early may , the independent wrote
he showed up with his cameraman again friday this time outside a restricted child-sex-abuse trial at leeds crown court , for what he inaccurately announced was the verdict
unable to enter the building , robinson stood outside for an hour and dispensed facts on the grooming of children for sex
ninety percent of the grooming gang convictions are muslim males , he told his facebook live viewers 250,000 by the time the stream ended
several police officers had been standing in the background of the frame
after the video ended , the independent wrote , the officers arrested him and put him in a police van.
ive done nothing , robinson protested and asked a small crowd of his fans to call a lawyer
in a short hearing the same afternoon , leeds live wrote , a judge watched the video , and robinson pleaded guilty to contempt of court forcing him to serve his previous suspended sentence plus another 10 months , or 13 months total
the judge said
reporters watched the hearing , but the judge ordered them not to publish anything about robinsons arrest until after the sex-assault trial concluded to avoid prejudicing the same jury with reports of robinson 's interference
i wo n't stop
here 's the gag order & here 's the judge smiling as tommy is about toget arrested with one of the officers involved freetommy
news of the arrest leaked almost instantly , and far-right personalities portrayed it as the act of a police state
reason 1776 for the original brexit
dont let america follow in those footsteps
keying off robinsons previous claims that muslim prison inmates wanted to kill him , roseanne barr called his arrest a death sentence.
donald trump jr. compared it to the cause for the american revolution , and mike cernovich said a compilation of deleted news articles about the arrest was the most terrifying video you 'll see today.
abc cancels roseanne after its star goes on a vitriolic and racist twitter rant
u.s. websites ignored the ban
conservative outlets and alt-right blogs accused the british media of abetting a coverup
drudge blasted the arrest across its front page , and 500,000 people signed a free tommy petition
the movement swelled until hundreds marched in london over the weekend
one protester screamed at a police officer
meanwhile , the independent and leeds live went to court to legally challenge the gag order in part by arguing that their competitors were already violating it
the newspapers won their challenge tuesday , the bbc wrote , and everyone is now free to report that robinson will be serving a 13-month prison sentence for interfering with two trials one last year and one last week
that has , at least , somewhat complicated his brief stint as a martyr
