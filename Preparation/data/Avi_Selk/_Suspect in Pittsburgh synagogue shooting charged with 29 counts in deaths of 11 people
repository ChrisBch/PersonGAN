pittsburgh a man armed with a semiautomatic assault-style rifle stormed the tree of life synagogue here saturday and shot worshipers during shabbat services , killing 11 and wounding six in the deadliest attack on jews in the history of the united states
the mass shooting targeted members of a synagogue that is an anchor of pittsburghs large and close-knit jewish community , a massacre that authorities immediately labeled a hate crime as they investigated the suspects history of anti-semitic online screeds
law enforcement officials identified the alleged shooter as robert d. bowers , 46 , a pittsburgh resident who the fbi said was not previously known to law enforcement
he was charged with 29 counts of federal crimes of violence and firearms offenses , federal prosecutors said late saturday
bowers allegedly burst into the synagogues regular saturday 9:45 a.m. service with an ar-15-style assault rifle and three handguns , authorities said
witnesses told police he shouted anti-semitic statements and began firing
the synagogue , in the squirrel hill neighborhood , did not have armed security guards
an attack on a tight-knit jewish community in the u.s. has left it shellshocked
police received calls about an active shooter at 9:54 a.m. and dispatched officers a minute later
police said bowers left the building and encountered the responding officers , shooting one before retreating into the synagogue to hide
more officers responded and , after an exchange of gunfire , bowers suffered multiple gunshot wounds , was arrested and was taken to a hospital , authorities said
four police officers were shot during the response and were in stable condition late saturday
it was unclear late saturday whether bowers was speaking with authorities or had an attorney
federal prosecutors filed 29 counts against bowers , charging him with federal civil rights crimes
the charges were announced in a statement released by scott w. brady , u.s. attorney for the western district of pennsylvania , and robert jones , special agent in charge of the fbis pittsburgh office
court documents were not immediately available and were expected to be released sunday morning
the pittsburgh massacre is yet another example of the homicidal fury and bigotry on the fringes of american society
it weaves together elements of many other active-shooter incidents that have horrified americans in recent years , and highlighted the unusual frequency of mass casualty events in this country in comparison with almost every other nation in the world
once again the suspect was a man armed with a semiautomatic assault-style weapon as was , for example , the gunman who killed 49 people in orlandos pulse nightclub in 2016
political , religious and civic leaders condemned saturdays massacre and vowed to support the jewish community
suspected synagogue shooter appears to have railed against jews , refugees online
president trump denounced the massacre and said something needs to be done about such crimes , suggesting a more frequent and speedier use of the death penalty , saying it should be brought into vogue.
he said the massacre could have been prevented if the synagogue had armed security guards
trump has frequently suggested that more armed people could deter mass shootings , making such comments after shooting rampages in parkland , fla. , and orlando in recent years
armed law enforcement officers were , in fact , present at both of those mass shootings
trump ordered flags flown at half-staff at public grounds until sunset wednesday in solemn respect for the victims , the white house said in a statement
the anti-defamation league , founded more than a century ago , has documented numerous murderous attacks on jews in the united states , such as the assault by a white supremacist on the u.s
holocaust museum in 2009 that killed a security guard
the previous deadliest anti-semitic attack , the adl said , was actually a case of mistaken religious identity that claimed four lives
it happened in 1985 , when a racist attacked charles goldmark and his family in seattle , thinking they were jewish
the adl said saturday that anti-semitic incidents rose 57 percent in 2017 , with 1,986 documented events , a spike the league attributed to an increase of such incidents in high schools and on college campuses
carl chinn , president of the nonprofit faith based security network , said saturdays massacre was the 15th mass murder defined as four or more fatalities in a house of worship in u.s. history
the first was the 1963 birmingham , ala. , bombing of the 16th street baptist church that killed four african american girls , he said
on saturday , members of the tree of life synagogue gathered at a makeshift grief center nearby to learn the fate of loved ones
on social media , synagogue members quickly relayed news of who was safe
but there would be 11 names all adults missing from the check-in
community gathers to mourn victims of synogogue shooting
synagogue member arnold freedman , 91 , a psychologist , had intended to go to tree of life at 10 a.m. , but he stayed home because a repairman was working in his basement
he began getting calls from friends as soon as the shooting began
chuck diamond , who grew up in squirrel hill and was a rabbi at tree of life for seven years , said he had always feared a day like this
as news of the shooting spread , police locked down the nearby rodef shalom congregation
police also raced to synagogues in washington , new york city , chicago and los angeles to provide additional security
the tree of life building houses three synagogues and has multiple communities that worship simultaneously , bisno said , calling it the center of jewish life on shabbat morning.
in recent years , pittsburgh brought on a former fbi agent to act as a security point person , according to bisno
his congregation recently went through an active-shooter training
saturday was the first time there was a community need to put it into practice
its frightening , he said.
it could happen anywhere at any time.
he felt that somebody was finally talking to him how the package-bomb suspect found inspiration in trump
the fbi said saturday that authorities believe bowers acted alone
authorities who entered the crime scene described it as stunning in its savagery
said jones , the fbi special agent in charge
the pittsburgh attack came days after the arrest of a florida man who allegedly sent more than a dozen pipe bombs to prominent critics of trump , and amid feverish midterm-election campaigning rife with attack ads
several leaders have said the nations political rhetoric has become too polarizing , perhaps inspiring recent violence
gab , a social media platform that has attracted many far-right users , said saturday that the company had suspended an account that matched the alleged shooters name , turning the messages over to the fbi
the account included repeated attacks on jews , references to white supremacist and neo-nazi symbols , and attacks on the hebrew immigrant aid society , known as hias , which works with the federal government to resettle refugees in american communities
mark hetfield , president and chief executive of hais , said his agency has seen plenty of hate , and actively works to help people who are fleeing such hate
the recent spate of mass shootings led tree of life rabbi jeffrey myers to write on the synagogues blog , lamenting the lack of national action to address gun violence in the wake of the parkland school shooting
