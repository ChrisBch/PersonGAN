the c-130 hercules is like the ancient elephant of the modern air force huge , strong and put to almost endless uses
since the 1950s , the planes have hauled massive cargo loads to war zones , been converted into gunships and bombers , and been packed with electronics to hunt for hurricanes
and like the old war elephants , when a c-130 falls , it goes down hard
in 2002 , both wings ripped off a tanker-modified hercules as it doused wildfires in california , sending the fuselage spinning like a missile into the trees , killing three people
on wednesday , a hercules crashed onto a state highway in georgia , killing all nine people on board and leaving witnesses on the ground hardly able to believe what they had seen
the plane which in its long history has served as a weather reconnaissance craft and a rescue vehicle for stranded hurricane victims took off about 11:30 a.m. wednesday from an airport in savannah
on board were nine air national guard members from the c-130s home base in puerto rico , bound for arizona
the purpose of the trip was unclear
military officials first said that the plane was on a training mission , and then that it was due to be decommissioned in arizona , and then that the details were unknown
in any case , the plane had barely cleared the runway at savannah/hilton head international airport before something went catastrophically wrong

a few miles south of the airport , cnn reported , roger best felt the ground rumble beneath his truck as the plane passed low overhead
others would see the c-130 appear to make a hard left turn
it seemed to best as if the pilot tried to veer away from the crowded north savannah suburbs in which case he thinks the pilot saved his life and many others
he barely made it over the tree line , best said
the plane headed toward the normally busy intersection of state highway 21 and crossgate road , where a county sheriffs spokeswoman would later say an absolute miracle prevented it from striking any cars
he told the savannah morning news
jones looked down for a moment , he said , and by the time he looked back up , the plane was on the ground
a security camera at a truck yard several blocks away captured the planes final descent
the hercules glided toward the highway intersection , falling slowly at first
then its wings 132 feet from tip to tip began to spin around its axis like a weather vane
the planes pitch became steeper and steeper , until finally its nose pointed directly toward the ground it disappeared from the cameras view behind a row of trees
five seconds later , the camera video showed , a pillar of fire and black smoke rose from those same trees , spewing into the blue , cloudless sky
power , phone and internet service went out in the surrounding neighborhoods , the morning news reported
lights flickered , and buildings shook across the northern suburbs of savannah
from the circle k parking lot , garrett said , he heard no sound but saw flames on the horizon and hoped no one had been hurt
at a wrecking yard down the street from the crash site , denver goodwin told cnn that the ground shook like a bomb and that people around him began to panic
he said as cross-street traffic passed in front of the dark smoke
debris scattered hundreds of feet from the point of impact , a county spokeswoman told the morning news
jet fuel started small fires along the side of the road that firefighters later smothered in a white sea of foam
as the smoke cleared and the bodies were counted , officials cleared witnesses away from the crash site
they blockaded the highway , warning that it was likely to stay closed for weeks as the military investigates what went wrong
in aerial photos , only the tail of the hercules appears intact , a u.s. flag symbol clearly visible at the tip
the tail lies exactly in the middle of the highway , aligned almost perfectly with the lane lines as if it had landed there and the rest of the plane had simply melted away
