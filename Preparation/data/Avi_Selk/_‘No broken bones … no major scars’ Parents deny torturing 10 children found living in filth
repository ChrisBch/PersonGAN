ten children have been removed from a home in fairfield , calif. , where police say they were tortured , burned , beaten and even shot with a pellet gun while living amid squalor and abuse of all kinds
all of this allegedly took place inside a bright , gable-roofed , four-bedroom house that looks from the outside as well-kept as the rest of those on the cul-de-sac
some neighbors of ina rogers and jonathan allen said they had no idea the couple even had so many children
and rogers , out on bail while her husband appeared in court on 15 felony charges monday , gave reporters an open-house tour of what she insisted was a loving if unconventional home
my husband is an amazing person , she said.
i am an amazing mother.
the 31-year-old is the mother of all 10 children from a 4-month-old infant to her oldest , a 12-year-boy
allen , a year younger than rogers , is the father of eight of the children , she said
larry magney , who lives across the street on fieldstone court , told the san francisco chronicle that the couple moved in about a year ago
magney was coming home from church one day at the end of march , he said , and found rogers running around the neighborhood in search of her 12-year-old
rogers later told reporters that the boy had left home , angry , because she had taken his computer tablet away
the boy was eventually found sleeping under a bush in a neighbors yard , police said
what officers saw when they returned him to his home on march 31 caused authorities to seize the children and launch a criminal investigation
urine , human and animal feces , garbage and rotten food littered the floor , police said , and heaps of debris blocked off parts of the house
pictures obtained by abc affiliate kgo show furniture , trash , toys and miscellany scattered at every angle , as if a storm had torn through the home
a bathroom was covered from wall-to-wall in animal droppings
a look at the new lives of siblings freed from a house full of chains
by way of explanation , rogers told police that she had torn the house apart looking for the 12-year-old , the ap reported
when she was later asked why all 10 children slept in a single room while the other bedrooms were used as the parents quarters , a meditation room and a playroom , rogers replied that the children liked it that way
the mother was arrested march 31 , the same night her son was returned to her , and booked into solano county jail for alleged child neglect
all her children were then taken into protective custody by solano county child welfare services and placed in the care of other family members , with whom they remain
in the six weeks since that arrest , police said , authorities have interviewed the eight older children and learned more disturbing details about their lives
the children had been home-schooled and were seen outside so rarely that some neighbors were shocked to learn more than a few lived at the house
some of the children , police said , described incidents of intentional abuse dating to 2014 puncture wounds , burns , bruising and injuries consistent with being shot with an airsoft or bb gun
on friday , allen was also arrested and charged with nine counts of felony torture and six counts of felony child abuse
he appeared in court monday , pleaded not guilty , and was ordered held in lieu of about $ 5 million bail
sharon henry , chief deputy district attorney for solano county , called the fathers behavior sadistic and said rogers would likely also face more charges
henry said at a news conference
but the mother , free on bail since early april , held a sort of news conference of her own monday
she told reporters in front of her house , according to the ap.
theres no broken bones , there is no major scars , nothing.
she led reporters through the house , which the ap reported still looked squalid behind the cream-colored , hedge-lined exterior animal droppings littered the bathroom , and scuff marks still covered some walls
rogers said she felt unfairly judged for her lifestyle
she first got pregnant when she was 16 , she said , and had been with rogers for the last 10 years , and they both wanted a large family
they both worked , she said she on the graveyard shift as an ekg technician , and allen as a tattoo artist
aleida quartman , who told the ap that she was one of rogerss co-workers , said she knew the mother to spoil her family even if so many children , plus cats , a dog and fish left her house unsightly
allens mother , peggy allen , told the ap she had spoken to her son about the importance of housekeeping and christian values but that allen avoided her and kept his relatives away from the children
rogers told reporters
on tuesday , allen told kcra-tv from solano county jail that he has never spanked his children
on the same day , the solano county district attorneys office said it would seek to amend the complaint against rogers to add nine counts of felony child abuse
