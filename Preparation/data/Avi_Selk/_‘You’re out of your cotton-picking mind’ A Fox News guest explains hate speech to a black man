fox and friends organized a spirited discussion about left-wing language on sunday that opened with a clip of an msnbc personality comparing trump voters to nazis
the lefts racist rants continue , read the caption that accompanied the clip , and fox news host ed henry introduced the two debaters
arguing for the right , david bossie a former senior trump campaign aide and president of the conservative group citizens united
for the left , joel payne , a democratic strategist and a black man
we mention the latter fact for reasons that will become apparent
bossie spoke first , at length and at a high volume , enunciating syllables by pounding the air with his hands
if payne reacted to bossies choice of phrase there ever-picking minds he didnt show it on screen
bossie would keep talking for nearly four more minutes
this teens racist prom invite was a bad idea
but a free-speech expert says its his right
much of the segment was unintelligible
foreshadowing , again , that last bit
we dont need to transcribe everything
enough to know that when payne mentioned that former republican governor mike huckabee , one day earlier , had suggested that house minority leader nancy pelosi supported the gang ms-13 , bossie cut him off
she did
and when payne said extremist conservative rhetoric looks like charlottesville , bossie rolled his eyes
oh , please
and so on
bossie kept talking over the democrat , waving his hands and cranking up his indignation until , finally , he told payne
youre out of your cotton-picking mind
but payne noticed when bossie used it on fox and friends , and this time his reaction was apparent on the screen
cotton-picking mind
let me tell you something
you guys , bossie interrupted , you guys are out of your minds
ive got some relatives who picked cotton , okay
in a subsequent interview with msnbc , payne explained that his great grandfather had been a sharecropper , who like other black people had worked hard to better his familys circumstance
but he hardly got to say that on the fox set , between bossies constant interruptions
this is ridiculous , the republican said
im not attacking
im not out of my cotton-picking mind
youre out of your mind , bossie said.
youre out of your mind.
this is ridiculous , this is outrageous , continued bossie , who had never really closed his mouth
thanks , payne said.
both mens images blinked off the screen , and henry attempted to move the show on
he teased debates to come on north korea , seth rogen and sarah huckabee sanders
a new panel of commentators materialized on the screen , each man smiling and silent
u.s. officials separated him from his child
then he was deported to el salvador
but then the camera cut back to henry , who appeared to be nodding at some instruction conveyed from his earpiece , as seen in a clip recorded by mediaite
on the other side , henry did not mention north korea or seth rogan , but he made a statement that was not quite an apology
i just want to address what happened in that debate , he said.
it clearly offended joel payne
it offended many others
i dont know what david meant by it , what went back and forth between the two of them
bossie did not immediately respond to a request for comment , but apologized to payne , the network and his viewers in an afternoon tweet
during a heated segment on fox & friends today , i should have chosen my words more carefully and never used the offensive phrase that i did
i apologize to joel payne , fox news and its viewers
asked whether bossie would continue to be invited onto the show , fox news declined to comment , though a spokeswoman sent a statement from the network
on msnbc later in the weekend , payne said he accepted bossies apology , but wasnt at ease with the encounter
who reduce us into ethnic groups , he added
