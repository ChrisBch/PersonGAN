this is the story of the oldest known spider in the world and the people who knew her
the details are compiled largely from research conducted by barbara main and leanda mason , who knew her best over nearly half a century
she was born beneath an acacia tree in one of the few patches of wilderness left in the southwest australian wheat belt , in an underground burrow lined with her mothers perfect silk
her mother had used the same silk , strong and thick , to seal the burrows entrance against the withering heat of the summer of 1974 , and against all the flying , prodding things that prowled the north bungulla reserve
she lived like that , in safety and darkness , for the first six months of her life
then one day in the rainy autumn months , her mother unsealed the tunnel , and she left
its likely that two or three dozen spiderlings left the burrow with her , and that nearly all of them soon died
the 250-acre north bungulla reserve was surrounded completely by farmland and roads , abutting an abandoned gravel pit
space was scarce under the leaves protective shade , and competition was fierce
most of the spiders siblings would be eaten by birds or lizards or cannibalized by each other , or would bake to death in the sun
but she was fortunate
she found an unoccupied patch of earth a few feet from her mothers burrow and began to dig
she dug an almost perfect circle straight down into the soil , just large enough to fit her body , a small fraction of an inch across
then she lined the tunnel with silk , as her mother had lined the one in which she hatched
for as long as she lived , this would be her only home
she wove a silken door across the burrow 's mouth , attached on one side to make a hinge
she dragged hundreds of twigs to the edge of the doorway , one by one , so that they radiated out like fan blades
then she went inside , closed the door and waited , likely days or even weeks , for her first real meal
she was essentially blind but attuned to every vibration in the earth , so when she finally felt something move along the twigs an ant or small beetle , maybe she leaped out and pulled it in
in this way , she caught food when it came to her , and hid from the outside when there was nothing to eat
scientists called her gaius villosus one of dozens of trapdoor spider species that lived in the vanishing wilderness of the australian wheat belt
after a year in her burrow , in 1975 , she would have felt strange , heavy vibrations on the twigs outside her door
this often meant a predator was trampling around or a large forager like a kangaroo
this time , though , the vibrations were caused by barbara york main , who was standing directly over the burrow
main had grown up in the wheat belt , she would tell the australian broadcasting corp. years later
throughout the 20th century , farming and industrialization had destroyed almost all the wilderness in the region leaving patches like the north bungulla reserve as precious sanctuaries for the tiny species that held her fascination
now she was a zoologist with the university of western australia
on that day in 1975 , she knelt over the burrow , parted the twigs behind the spider 's door and fixed a small metal sign into the soil
it was engraved , 16.
a few feet away , main had marked another burrow 1 , and deduced that 1 was 16 's likely mother
and 24 and 30 were her likely sisters
main spent hours beneath the acacia tree , marking every burrow she could find
she was building a family tree of gaius villosus , whose hold on the earth seemed so fragile and about which humans knew so little
main told the international congress of arachnology in her first report in 1977 , according to her written paper.
a life-cycle of perhaps twenty years notwithstanding.
but 20 years was just a guess
among other things , she would later tell the abc , i wanted to know how long the spiders lived.

the next years were hard for the spiders
a long , dry summer in 1977 wiped out a third of one year 's generation , main wrote
hungry quail scratched open nests
a scorpion even invaded one burrow
still , 16 survived and grew larger , expanding her burrow every year , until it was as wide as a dime , then a quarter , and larger still
she had tagged and mapped 101 villosus burrows by then , all within a few meters of each other , near the edge of the old gravel pit
main was impressed by how long the spiders seemed to live
based on her estimates from their tunnel diameters and sporadic observations she had made before the study , she believed two matriarchs were at least 16 years old
they might be 18 or 20
main mentioned spider 16 only in passing in this early paper
she was only 4 years old and nothing special , yet

one day toward the end of the 1970s , spider 16 made a rare excursion to her front yard
she wove a sort of welcome mat outside her door a net laced with pheromones , which main would compare to a tea doily
then she went back down and closed the door waiting this time not for the skittering of prey , but for the knock of a male caller
main wrote in her paper about the very different lives of male and female villosus spiders
the males left their burrows as soon as they were sexually mature around age 6 or so to go search for doilies and knock on doors
the males never return to their burrows after mating , main wrote
they wandered until they died , and all died young
the female , however , went straight back to her burrow after sex
she sealed the door up extra tight with a finely contoured plug , crafted so precisely that it could seal out heat and rainwater , and spent the next year locked inside her home , to lay her eggs and shelter them

the next autumn , she unsealed the burrow and sent her children off into the world , to live or die as they could
these matriarchs were the secret to villosus spiders success in such an arid environment , main noted
in their deep bunkers , they could survive droughts and fires on the surface
they could mate every few years , and continually replenish the spider population
but even main did not guess how much 16 would overachieve
she spun , fed , spun and fed , and probably produced many generations of young in between many hardships
a swarm of grasshoppers ravaged the reserve in 1991 , according to a paper in pacific conservation biology
an invasive plant species began to spread from the gravel pit.
biodiversity is being reduced , the paper said
over the decades , spider 16s mother , siblings and countless cousins and children died
but her family tree kept growing , and each time 16 's burrow was checked , the webbing and swirl of twigs looked immaculate as ever
in 2013 , an australian broadcasting corp. reporter named vicki laurie became intrigued by reports that an 84-year-old zoologist had been cataloguing a family of spiders for 40 straight years
so laurie traveled with main , out to an an unremarkable bit of scrub in the wheat belt , and watched her work
when they reached the plaque of spider 16 , laurie was skeptical that it had really been occupied by the same spider for the last four decades
but main explained that females never left their burrows until they died , and no other spider ever moved in
main flipped open the door with a small knife , and through laurie , 16 was introduced to the world
laurie recalled in her report.
under my breath , i introduce myself and wish her well.
it was around this time that an undergraduate student , leanda mason , began to accompany main on her excursions to the reserve
to mason , who was studying to be an ecologist , the reserve looked like an eden in the blight of industrialized southwest australia teeming with species that might not be around much longer
by now , main had catalogued hundreds of spiders
generation after generation
but on each excursion , mason told the washington post , they would beeline directly to 16 's door , to visit the spider that never seemed to die
this became a tradition
on 16 's 40th birthday , mason said , she asked if she could give the spider a mealworm
barbara wouldnt let me , she said.
it interfered with the study.
main 's plan of cataloguing a family of spiders having succeeded far beyond her expectations , and she began to look forward to the project 's end
instead , she said , mains health declined before the spiders
the zoologist retired last year , in her late 80s , and mason , now studying for her doctorate in ecology at curtin university , took over the spider study
on oct. 31 , 2016 , she went out to the reserve with a drone , hoping to get a birds-eye view of how this small rectangle of bushland was holding up against the roads and fields
but like her mentor before her , she went straight to 16 first
when she arrived at the clearing that day , she noticed that the twigs around the door had lost their meticulous spiral fan shape
they lay scattered in disarray
mason looked at the silk door , and saw a tiny hole in the center , as if something had pierced it
she lifted the door and lowered an endoscope into the burrow , and confirmed what she already suspected
the spider was gone
a parasitic wasp had likely broken through the seal , and laid its eggs in 16 's body
on april 19 , mason , main and grant wardell-johnson co-published a paper in pacific conservation biology , announcing the death of spider 16 at age 43
she was the oldest spider known to have existed , mason wrote , eclipsing the previous record set by a 28-year-old tarantula
she wrote , beside a photo of a perfect hole beneath a tree nearly half a century of work main 's , hers and the spider 's
