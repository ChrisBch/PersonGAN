i have n't got the foggiest idea chrismasonbbc beautifully sums up the complexities of brexit
morning swept across the globe monday , and as reliable as the sunrise itself , out came all the talking heads with all their predictions on all the worlds problems
the odds favor rick scott going to the u.s. senate and ron desantis being the next governor , reporter steve bousquet told cnn from tallahassee
china would win a trade war versus the u.s. , investment expert thanos papasavvas confidently told bloomberg
in australia , market analyst elizabeth tian thought the christmas retail season was looking grim
on the same morning , bbc political correspondent chris mason stood between a tv camera and the palace of westminster to opine on his specialty britains looming deadline to leave the european union
it is a hot topic this week , as prime minister theresa may races to shore up political support for her last-minute withdrawal plan , lest the country depart europe in economic chaos
so where are we in all of this brexit process
mason asked , and answered moments later to be quite honest , looking at things right now , i havent got the foggiest idea what is going to happen in the coming weeks
he looked at the camera and waved a hand in the air
is the prime minister going to get a deal with the e.u.
is she going to be able to get it through the commons
dont know about that , either , he said , blowing an audible puff of air
i think you might as well get mr. blobby back on to offer his analysis , mason concluded , because , frankly , i suspect his is now as good as mine
mr. blobby is a polka-dot tv character who mostly runs around smashing things and shouting blobby
and mason once his morning spot hit the internet became a media hero
every time a u.s. colleague asks for the latest on brexit im going to show them chrismasonbbcs honest and unimprovable analysis , declared nbc news editor alastair jamieson , speaking for many
where pundits had been trying and failing for months to project order on the lurching complexities of the brexit process , mason had simply and courageously given up , ceding the intellectual high ground to a costumed monster with a one-word vocabulary
this man is absolutely brilliant
a journalist brave enough to say he hasnt the foggiest idea where brexit is going to go , wrote journalist brett debritz
we need honest uncertainty more than dishonest partisan punditry from clueless commentators
in truth , there was a bit more to it than that
mason has been copiously reporting on brexit for more than a year ( he boasts on his linkedin page of co-hosting the uks 209th most popular podcast , brexitcast
his puff of surrender on monday was not so much a dismissal of the subjects importance as a confession of limits on his ability to say anything useful about it
people like me are paid , arent we , to have insight and foresight and hindsight about these things , and to be able to project where were going to go , as he put it on tv that morning
- ) the aim was to try to explain that even a reasonable knowledge of what 's happening now only goes so far in being able to tell what will happen in the coming weeks and months
that said now that mason has discovered a viral market for on-air humility , he seems happy to corner it
they have to get something nailed down in the next 24 hours , he said on a follow-up segment
is that possible , yes
is it likely
mason threw his hands up and blew through his lips , producing a sound like a horse snort
i like the way your updates have just resorted to noises now , rather than words , the anchor said
