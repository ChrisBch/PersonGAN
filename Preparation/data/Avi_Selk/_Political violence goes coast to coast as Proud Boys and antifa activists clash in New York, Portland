street beatings and melees broke out on both coasts this weekend during confrontations involving the proud boys and antifascists ideologically opposed movements that both condone political violence and practice it with some regularity on their opponents
police in new york and portland are investigating viral videos of the attacks but have not yet blamed either group
new yorks democratic mayor , governor and attorney general , however , have accused the proud boys of instigating the weekends first act of violence
( representatives for the proud boys could not immediately be reached )
authorities must review these videos immediately and make arrests and prosecute as appropriate
hate can not and will not be tolerated in new york
here 's a message from a queens boy to the so-called 'proud boys ny has zero tolerance for your bs
gavin mcinnes , who founded the proud boys in 2016 as a nationalist mens club , was scheduled to speak at the metropolitan republican club that evening about deep state socialists and western values common themes for his group
after the speech , about two dozen proud boys emerged from the club to find a similarly sized group of protesters waiting to confront them , including antifascists , as seen in cellphone videos
while antifascists , or antifa activists , are more loosely organized than the hierarchical , uniformed proud boys , both groups consider each other dangerous to u.s. society and condone violence to defend their notions of it
cellphone videos show an unidentified victim writhing on the sidewalk while several men take turns kicking him , and at least a dozen proud boys in uniform polo shirts , scream various slurs
the video ends as police rush in to break up the confrontation
new york police said the victim refused medical treatment but spoke to investigators , and three people have been charged with assault
the new york times , however , reported that all three were affiliated with the anti-fascist group , rather than the proud boys , leading to confusion and messages from top state democrats calling for more investigation
the southern poverty law center , which considers the proud boys an extremist group , wrote that its members were joined at the event by an ultranationalist far-right skinhead crew , which may have also taken part in the attack caught on video
the next night , on the other side of the country , proud boys were reported among a right-wing group that marched through downtown portland toward their ideological opponents

someone put up some signage in downtown portland , mentions the proud boys
portland , which has long seen clashes between the far left and far right , has been consumed for two weeks with black lives matter protests over a fatal police shooting in september
those protests , in turn , provoked right-wing groups when video emerged last weekend of demonstrators blocking traffic and beating on a passing drivers car
so on saturday evening , a conservative group organized a flash march for law and order marching toward the downtown plaza where a memorial had been set up for the police shooting victim , patrick kimmons
weve got proud boys running security , one of the organizers said in a facebook live stream of the march
predictably , the marchers arrived at the plaza to find it full of counterprotesters chanting black lives matter.
the local antifascist group was among those live-tweeting from that side of fourth avenue
the right-wing marchers paused on the other side of the street , waving u.s. flags and chanting back all lives matter , and u.s.a. , u.s.a.
and eventually shouted threats
portland police had apparently been expecting trouble and managed to dissuade it for half an hour or so by lining up in tactical gear along the street
but after sundown , things kicked off
the antifascists may have provoked the violence , according to mike bivins , a freelance reporter who documented the ensuing melee on twitter
one of them burned an american flag as the proud boys and company were leaving , causing them to return
another antifascist then doused the entire group with pepper spray , bivins wrote
from there , the scene devolved into something like an exponentially larger version of the manhattan assault
( explicit videos below )
huge brawl just happened and police came in to firenless lethal rounds on people
right-wingers were clubbing people w clubs outside of kellys olympian , way worse than nyc last night
proud boys and patriot prayer and antifa just had a huge wild fight
while its hard to tell who is who in cellphone videos , a man stepped out from a sea of red make america great again hats and punched someone in the opposite crowd in the face
various fistfights and scuffles then started , with some people scrambling across the street , slamming into windows or collapsing to the pavement in a flurry of kicks
a man in a camouflage shirt followed the melee around , spraying liquid into the crowd
finally , an armored police officer stepped up and shot foam bullets into the sidewalk , which dispersed the combatants
in statement sent to the washington post on facebook , a representative for patriot prayer , the group that organized the march , said most of the people in the melee were not members but people who gathered with us as we marched.
the statement continued
presuming this is the guy who got stomped out
his face is a bloody mess as people follow , urging him to leave
right wingers calling on their comrades to leave him alone
police wrote in a statement afterward
they had made no arrests by sunday morning but , like their counterparts in new york , continued to investigate copious amounts of amateur footage
officers spotted not only pepper spray in the crowd , but also hard-knuckled gloves , firearms , batons and knives , police wrote not to mention flagpoles turned into clubs
police did not specify which weapons belonged to which group
