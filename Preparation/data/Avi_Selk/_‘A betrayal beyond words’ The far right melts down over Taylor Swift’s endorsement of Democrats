the author edited the post minutes later nvm didnt realize taylor sold out to the left.
missives about swifts perceived betrayal of conservatism clogged far-right message boards
hey , teens , these taylor swift puns from a tennessee democrat are on fleek
the delusion traces back to the middle of the obama administration , 2011 , when a certain fraction of 4chan users convinced themselves that swift had let them name her cat
in some ways , its not much different from how every other conspiracy theory arises out of nonsense on that anonymous message board
among the hundreds of thousands of posts written on 4chan that november , one was a kitten-naming contest
the winning name was meredith , which lo and behold was also the name of swifts new kitten , according to a people magazine article that 4chan users subsequently passed around in astonishment
the fact that swift had named her kitten meredith at least three days before the contest was held made little difference to those who convinced themselves she was a secret 4chan user
a myth that began with a kitten took a dark turn a few years later , when a neo-nazi blogger came across a joke meme that mashed up photos of swift with quotes from adolf hitler
he apparently mistook these as authentic and published them on the daily stormer under the headline aryan goddess taylor swift nazi avatar of the white european people.
alt-right white supremacists have chosen taylor swift as their aryan goddess icon , through no fault of her own
probably not many people believed swift was a nazi but between the 4chan rumors and the daily stormer memes , a vague but widespread belief spread across right-wing circles that the star was on their side
more than swooning they were expecting
this is a betrayal beyond words
taylor swift , you have every right to vote for the candidate you like but putting your reasons for in public , while having people who adore you on both sides , is just appalling
you 've done a terrible thing being sjw at the wrong time

she was shown on time magazines person of the year cover in 2017 as one of the silence breakers fighting back against sexual harassment

but hope springs eternal until it suddenly goes dry , which it did abruptly sunday night

the battle between taylor swift fans and alt-right incels is going to be fascinating
gg , you just lost over half of your fanbase , including me , swimmingjunky wrote in one of the_donalds most popular posts monday morning , up-voted by thousands of people
( even the president said monday that he likes swifts music about 25 percent less now , ok
and where there was not despondency , there was anger
even on a good day , 4chans overtly misogynistic /pol/ board is awash in rants from men angry at feminists and social justice warriors they believe have taken over society
as youd expect , the mood was more foul than usual after the forums imaginary protege declared her real feelings
the washington posts language policies prevent linking to most of what 4chan had to say
suffice to say , a meme of pepe the frog openly weeping with a gun to his head appeared in one of the most popular threads , more or less summing up the mood
