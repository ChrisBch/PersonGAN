a man who caused panic at a baltimore theater by shouting heil hitler
and heil trump
during a showing of fiddler on the roof has apologized , explaining that the outburst was his ill-conceived attempt to protest president trumps immigration policies
anthony derlunas ii told wbal-tv from his front porch , where several reporters tracked him down friday two days after police removed him from his balcony seat at the hippodrome theatre
derlunas said in a shaky voice.
i have no hate in me.
that didnt help my thinking one bit , derlunas said
they showed his photo , and my stomach just dropped neighbors recall synagogue massacre suspect as a loner
the 58-year-old said the first acts final scene in which an anti-semitic pogrom disrupts a jewish wedding reminded him of trumps immigration policies , which call for mass deportations and a wall along the u.s. southern border
so during the intermission , with the wine still infusing his logic , derlunas stood up from his seat in the balcony to make a performance of his own
he told wjz
what happened instead became the subject of a brief police investigation and viral videos
derlunas allegedly shouted , heil hitler
and heil trump
and made a nazi salute from his seat as people jumped from theirs and ran for the exits some expecting another massacre to follow the shouts
the next thing i expected to hear was gunshots , frankly , said rich scherr , who filmed the commotion from below as derlunass balcony neighbors appeared to confront him
he told the sun
security personnel escorted him and his girlfriend out of the theater
at least one frightened patron had called 911 , and an officer arrived at the lobby shortly before 10 p.m. to interview derlunas
the officer wrote in his report
he had no criminal history and so was released from the hippodrome with lifetime ban from returning
i would ban me too if i was in their position , derlunas told the sun on friday , after the anti-defamation league demanded his prosecution for what the group called an anti-semitic outburst.
in his doorstep interviews , derlunas tried to convince any skeptics that espousing bigotry has been the opposite of his intent
he told the sun
hes been trying to make amends
derlunass listed phone number was not accepting incoming calls over the weekend
the sun reported that he had phoned the theater and the baltimore jewish council to apologize and was trying to reach local rabbis to do the same
