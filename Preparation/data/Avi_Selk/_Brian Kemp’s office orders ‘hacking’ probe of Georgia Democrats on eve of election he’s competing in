but neither kemps campaign nor his secretary of states office provided evidence that democrats had tried to hack into georgias voter registration system
candice broce , a spokeswoman for the secretary of states office , said in an interview that democrats were in possession of an email with script attached to it that , if launched , could have been used to extract personal voter registration data
democratic officials , in turn , accused kemp of defamatory accusations and released the email in question , showing that it had been forwarded to a democratic volunteer by someone not affiliated with the party who was flagging a potential data vulnerability
the volunteer forwarded the email to the partys voter protection director , who shared it with cybersecurity experts , who in turn alerted kemps office , they said
two voting rights attorneys suggested that kemp launched the probe as a distraction , hours after they told authorities about potential security flaws in the electronic voter systems he is responsible for maintaining

by late sunday , kemps opponent , stacey abrams , was trying to reframe the investigation as an example of how she says the republican has abused his government power as he seeks a higher office
the office of the secretary of state , which democrats have accused throughout kemps campaign of manipulating the electoral system for his benefit , announced the investigation sunday morning with an all-caps headline that appeared directly below a voters guide on a government website

the attached statement contained no evidence and almost no details on the democratic party of georgias possible cyber crimes , but it said kemps office had launched the investigation saturday evening and alerted the fbi and the department of homeland security
by early sunday afternoon , cross and at least one other voting rights attorney had called foul on kemp
cross forwarded an email between himself and an fbi agent from saturday , sent before kemps office launched its probe
in it , the washington lawyer tells the agent that a secretary of state website set up for voters to check their registration status and find polling locations may be leaking confidential voter information
bruce brown , a lawyer with the coalition for good governance , told the who what why blog that he had alerted kemps attorneys to similar issues on saturday
the democratic party of georgia later released a saturday email exchange between two of its staff members , forwarding someone elses report about the security issue
the party suggested that kemp had obtained this exchange , mistakenly assumed that the staffers had tried to hack the voter registration system and launched its investigation on a faulty premise
a spokeswoman for the party wrote
several hours after announcing its hacking investigation , after contradictory reports emerged , kemps office issued an updated statement that sounded somewhat less dire

this isnt the first time kemps office has claimed its voting systems were hacked based on thin evidence
after the presidential election in 2016 , the hill reported , kemp accused president barack obamas department of homeland security of launching at least 10 failed cyber attacks on georgia
an investigation during president trumps administration concluded that the supposed attacks were actually normal and automatic computer message exchanges generated by the microsoft applications involved
this weekends investigation into kemps rival party was immediately condemned as a political ploy by democrats and some commentators , who believe he should not oversee an election in which he is competing

abrams , who is polling almost neck-and-neck with kemp , told cnn on sunday that she had been unaware of her opponents investigation into her party
in a statement late sunday , kemps spokesman issued the following statement
voting rights has become a major issue in the campaign , which has drawn national attention because , if elected , abrams , 44 , would become the nations first black female governor
abrams , who four years ago started a nonprofit group whose goal was to sign up hundreds of thousands of unregistered people of color , has clashed repeatedly with kemp , whom she calls the architect of voter suppression.
kemp investigated the group , with which abrams is no longer affiliated , on suspicion of fraud but found no wrongdoing
kemp , 55 , who has argued that the policies are aimed at preventing voter fraud , also has been criticized for having purged more than a million voters from the rolls during the past year
he has rejected calls , including one from former president jimmy carter , that he should step down as the states top elections official while he is running for governor
although lawmakers and elections officials in republican-controlled states have cited concerns about cheating to enact strict voter registration and identification laws , there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the united states
