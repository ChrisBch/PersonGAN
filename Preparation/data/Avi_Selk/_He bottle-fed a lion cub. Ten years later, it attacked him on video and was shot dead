the video above is disturbing , and if it is all there was to this story , it would have been bad enough
recorded by a tourist in a south african safari park last weekend , the footage shows a lion drag a man from a tour truck his neck in its jaws as if he were a chicken
the animal drags the man behind a bush while one onlooker sobs hysterically and another pleads for a rifle
the footage ends as the sound of gunshots and screaming cut across the 120-acre marakele predator center
those images , however , do not explain the sad context of the saturday attack
the man dragged from the truck was the parks owner , michael hodge , who had moved to south africa with his family because he loved lions so much , local news outlets reported
the 72-year-old had bottle-raised the lion who attacked him and cared for it all his life , a full decade
hodge now lies in a hospital bed , traumatized , and may never know why shamba turned on him
the lion hodge loved was shot dead to save his life
the extraordinary life and death of the worlds oldest known spider
south africa has in recent years become somewhat notorious for its lion hunts , in which rich tourists can pay thousands of dollars to kill drugged animals that have no chance to flee
the marakele predator center was nothing like that
no hunting was allowed , news 24 reported
instead , visitors could camp a few miles from the town of thabazimbi , in scrubland backdropped by south africas northern mountain ranges , among lions , bengal tigers , meerkats , mongooses and marmoset monkeys
your bed will truly vibrate with the lions roar
the centers website informed prospective volunteers
hodge had once been a trader in england , and his wife a hairdresser and shop owner , the manila bulletin wrote in a travel article
the couple and their two children moved to south africa in late 1990s , the bulletin wrote , to make a business of hodges dream of living among lions
he bottle-fed a baby shamba in 2008 , cbs news reported , two years before the marakele center opened for business
in a photo for the center , he and his wife , chrissy , pose grinning she snuggling a cub , michael with a monkey wrapped around his neck
when the bulletins travel reporter visited in 2013 , she wrote , i could see nothing but endless tall grass and dry scrub.
she heard shamba and the other golden lions roar in the distance , and kissed a half-ton tiger through a gap in the electrified fence
the tourists then gaped as lions climbed all over the truck , wild animals feeding just inches from their cameras
it was at the end of a similar excursion inside the gates on saturday , news 24 reported , that something went terribly wrong
when the tourist began recording , shamba was standing in the grass a few yards from the lion mobile
a man on the other side of a fence , outside the gates , appeared to be calling to the lion and throwing bait into the grass to lead him away from the truck
a park employee told cbs news this was standard procedure an employee would lure the lions away from the vehicle , and hodge would then open the gate and drive the tourists out of the enclosure
mike does this regularly , a family spokeswoman told news 24.
shamba mysteriously turned around on saturday.
this hunter waged a war on feral cats
now he says he has become the target of attacks
in the video , the lion is seen sniffing at the grass , as if considering something , then continuing to walk away from the truck
a friend of hodges told the sun a strange smell seemed to be upsetting the lions that day
shamba , come on , the man outside the fence called , before throwing another piece of bait onto the grass
come on , he said , and the shutter of a camera clicked
when shamba walked many yards into the distance , hodge got out of the truck and walked into the video frame
he , too , considered an object in the grass , kicked it , then turned back toward the truck
then he started to run
it took shamba just three seconds to close the distance between them
hodge nearly made it back inside the vehicles cab , but the lion pulled him to the ground , clamped his jaws down near hodges neck and dragged him back into the enclosure , as if he weighed nothing
inside the cage on the back of the truck , people screamed and yelled
get a gun.
the lion briefly dropped his prey in the grass and backed off a few feet as hodge writhed there
then shamba grabbed him again and pulled hodge behind a bush , out of the camera frame
shoot
a man shouted , followed by a gunshot , and soon a second and third , and more
nothing stirred behind the bush
a woman who had been pleading for someone to help hodge began to sob
get a rifle , a man said.
somebody get a rifle , just in case.
the lion stood passively in the grass , as if unsure what to do
please , somebody help him , a woman said
is anybody getting a rifle
a man said
while the video does not show it , news 24 reported that one of the employees outside the fence shot and killed the lion to save hodges life
his jaw had been broken and his neck gashed in several places , but hodge was recovering in a hospital wednesday and apparently doing well
in a photo published by the sun , he is grinning , and bloody bandages cover his neck
despite the pose , his family told news 24 , hodge remained traumatized by the sudden aggression and subsequent death of the lion he had once fed from a bottle
