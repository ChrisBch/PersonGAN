jim bunner waved to the camera , cellphone in one hand , kttc-tv-branded microphone in the other , his head bare to the minnesota morning chill
he could have been any other reporter standing outside the rochester civic center on thursday , awaiting president trumps rally
at least , so it seemed in that particular shot
ive met people all the way from mankato , from iowa , from eagle lake , you name it bunner said in his nbc news stations facebook live feed
they are excited for the fact the president of the united states is visiting rochester
this is big
this is yuge , in the words of donald trump
the multimedia reporter might have been simply channeling the enthusiasm of the crowd thousands of people lined all the way to the back of the civic center , most of them sporting make america great again hats
but just outside the camera frame visible for a split second when it pulled back from bunners face to pan around his own bright red maga hat peeked out from his duffel bag
kttc-tv dismissed bunner the next day , according to the associated press , after another reporter photographed him wearing the hat and posted it on twitter
caption whyyyyy
as buzzfeed noted , bunners publicly available social media feed was full of his political views something that the washington post , the new york times , politico and many other new outlets discourage
i never have been a big trump fan , bunner wrote a few days after election day in 2016
i love a lot of what hes saying and believe if he could live up to all of these promises hes made about immigration and the supreme court , he could be a fantastic president
look on the bright side , he added
at least now obamas legacy has been destroyed , hillary clinton will never be president , and theres gon na be a whole lot of pissed off liberals in the morning
a few months after kttc hired him in december 2017 , buzzfeed reported , the reporter changed his facebook profile image to a photo of himself in front of the white house with the caption im the nra
sederstrom , however , said that bunners political views were not a factor in his dismissal
on twitter , bunner thanked supporters ( one tweeted , we got your back
maga ) , politely declined a gofundme account , and deflected criticism against his former employer
its not unfair , he tweeted
kttc-tv is not to blame
