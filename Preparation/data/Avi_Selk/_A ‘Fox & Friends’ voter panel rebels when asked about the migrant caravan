steve doocy was about 30 seconds into mondays episode of fox & friends when he announced a fox news alert
weve got a fox news alert
fox news alert blared a big red graphic on the screen
the migrant caravan in central america is growing , doocy said when the alert graphic stopped obscuring his face
seven thousand strong
said his co-host ainsley earhardt
they cut to live footage of a texas border city approximately a 400-hour walk from the caravans position in southern mexico where a fox news correspondent was stationed on the ground
asked brian kilmeade , the other co-host
you might think so , to take a spin through the big conservative news sites
trump apparently misunderstands fox & friends joke , makes baffling tweet
the caravan was front and center on breitbart and the drudge report on monday , as it has been often since several hundred people formed it in honduras around oct. 12 and started walking north
meanwhile , president trump fox & friends watcher-in-chief just called the caravan a national emergy on twitter
trump said the caravan has criminals and unknown middle easterners mixed in , and the mexican military cant stop it , and also that it was organized by democrats to hurt republicans in the u.s. midterm elections
have not seen a single middle easterner in the caravan , realdonaldtrump
have seen hundreds of women and children and babies , though
the washington post , cnn , the associated press and many other mainstream outlets have covered the migrants journey with considerably less foreboding , just as they did a smaller caravan that petered out before it reached the u.s. border earlier this year
they travel together for safety as they cross regions controlled by gangs and drug cartels
most of them hope to seek asylum at the border or more likely to try to cross into the united states illegally
so despite the caravans size , its no different in purpose than smaller mass migrations that routinely cross central america
the last one passed through last spring , drawing its own entourage of reporters and outraged tweets from trump
it grew to about 1,000 people , which , it turned out , was too large for purposes of logistics , and so the caravan disbanded in mexico city long before it reached the u.s. border
its unclear how a group at least five times larger apparently reliant on food and water from passersby hopes to make it any farther
that context was not in mondays fox news alert
some of it came across later in the episode perhaps unintentionally when doocy brought out a panel of four people identified as independent voters and asked about the caravan
he chose to blow it a rare dissent from the couch of fox & friends after trump attacks ford
doocy tried again
what should the united states do
okay , doocy said , pointing to the second independent voter.
cathy real quick.
said cathy stewart , a vice president with independent voting
mm-hmm , said doocy
instead , they use it like a partisan football , she continued
sure , said doocy
and , moving on john , real quick.
but john opdyke continued the previous independent voters line of thought
theres very little honest discussion about whats actually happening.
and aaron
his voice had fallen to something like a raspy whisper
said aaron commey , a libertarian and the final independent voter on the panel
doocy collected his notes and sat up on his stool
he told the voters.
so lets see what happens
and with that , fox & friends dispensed with mondays migrant news alert and moved on to the subject of democratic sen. elizabeth warrens dna
the next episode airs tuesday morning
perhaps another fox news alert will pop up then , too
correction a previous version of this article misidentified the independent voting organization cathy stewart belongs to
