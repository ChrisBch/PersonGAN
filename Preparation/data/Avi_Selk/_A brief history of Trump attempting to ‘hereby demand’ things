did you know hereby is a special word , because it signifies the speaker is about to accomplish some action simply by uttering the sentence that follows it
said governor ratcliffe in disneys pocahontas.
thus , the land he stood on was claimed
the moment ratcliffe spoke , before he had even planted his flag in the soil , he created the british settlement of jamestown out of nothing but hereby and a verb
in linguistics , they are called performative verbs magic words that can alter reality simply by being uttered
there is even something called the hereby test to identify them
we are not quite sure president trump understands the concept
investigate whether the obama administration spied on his presidential campaign , trump wrote on twitter on sunday at least his fourth attempt as president to pull off a hereby.
it does not quite work , though , does it
trump hereby demanded an investigation as soon as he sent the tweet , but confusingly , he also said he would not demand the investigation until monday , officially , whatever that means
it is as if ratcliffe had officially claimed jamestown for the king , then added he would not officially claim it until he had finished dinner
twitter had fun with this
i hereby demand and will do so tomorrow ... is how i start every sentence about my plans to start working on my summer body
i hereby demand , and will do so officially tomorrow , that ants be made as fuzzy as bees so more people want to save them
( tetramorium pulcherrimum , uganda )
the hashtag iherebydemand was still going strong monday morning , even as the justice department presumably waited for trump to officially demand the investigation he already hereby demanded the previous day
speaking of hereby , trump at least spelled it correctly this time
i hereby demand you , realdonaldtrump , recuse yourself from going to any more schools until you learn to spell ( h/t hunterschwarz )
the president previously attempted to hereby an investigation into existence more than a year ago at the time demanding one into his democratic rivals , charles e. schumer and nancy pelosi
he had to write three separate tweets before he got the formula right hear by , hearby and , finally , hereby.
then trump discovered hereby demanding something does not necessarily mean anyone is going to thereby do it
there is as yet no sign his administration formally investigated schumer and pelosi for appearing in old pictures with russians
based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting trump campaign , we are hereby
he was upset at the time over the posts political coverage , and particularly a story about trumps apparent suggestion obama could be complicit in a mass shooting
that time , his hereby worked perfectly
post reporters were indeed barred from trumps campaign events after the tweet
the posts executive editor called the revocation a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press.
this brings us to one final point
in the movie pocahontas , ratcliffes claim on the land is opposed by the people who already live there , and the governor eventually goes back to england in defeat
the historical settlement of jamestown did not go particularly well , either
in other words , a hereby only goes so far
there is a difference between actions and words regardless of whether they are official , or hereby delayed until tomorrow
