bbc three , the edgiest bbc , woke up super early saturday so it could watch the run-up to the royal wedding and make fun of it on twitter
make way for the beckhams you peasants royalwedding
you vs the hat she tells you not to worry about royalwedding
when your ex turns up to your wedding
lol , why do you have to be that way , bbc three
his royal highness prince henry was marrying meghan markle and you were , like , lip-syncing the queen or something
no wonder bbc three isnt even allowed on regular tv anymore
it probably never will be again if it oh
just saying _ ( ) _/
the prince and princess hadnt even said their vows yet , and already youre trying to start some trans-atlantic drama
thats president trumps 2017 inauguration crowd on the left the same one trump claimed looked like a million , a million and a half people , and which his press secretary insisted was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration , period
( even though anyone could see that president obamas crowd in 2009 had been larger )
spicer earns four pinocchios for false claims on inauguration crowd size
what were saying is trump is demonstrably touchy about crowd sizes , and bbc three straight up compared his inauguration to the massive audience lined up to watch the wedding ceremony , which trump reportedly wasnt even invited to
just saying nothing that was obvious shade
think this all went over well with trumps fans
it did not
suddenly bbc threes twitter feed was like a repeat of the inauguration , with everyone arguing over how many people were in this picture and that picture , and whose crowd was bigger
then , reuters and some other news outlets estimated that only about 100,000 people had showed up to watch the prince and princess , which is actually a much smaller crowd than trump drew last year
so then bbc three was like just kidding , send us all your favourite crowd pics as if it had only been trying to post random pictures of crowds , with no implications or comparisons intended
to be honest , some of them were more impressive anyway
queen at knebworth though
president obama 's inauguration 2009
