the morning after winning the senate race in tennessee , rep. marsha blackburn ( r ) appeared on fox & friends to take revenge on taylor swift
well , i hope taylor will shake it off , blackburn said , making the most obvious pun possible after trouncing the pop megastars preferred candidate , democrat phil bredesen , by 10 points and more than 200,000 votes on tuesday
somewhat magnanimous in victory , blackburn assured swift and her fans that they have an open door with me.
but she also touted her own campaigns celebrity buzz just a host of folks with me from the music industry , as blackburn put it , noting her support from lee greenwood and gospel singer larry gatlin
blackburn also name-dropped the music modernization act of 2018 , which she supported as a congress member
swifts surprise endorsement of bredesen on instagram last month caused a sensation online
her denunciation of blackburn for opposing lgbtq causes and domestic violence protections inspired her fans to register to vote en masse
it devastated far-right internet commentators who had hoped that swifts years-long silence on national politics meant she was secretly on their side
and it led pundits to wonder whether she could unleash a wave of young , first-time voters in traditionally conservative states
but in the end , bredesen didnt get half as many votes as swifts instagram endorsement got likes
hey , teens , these taylor swift puns from a tennessee democrat are on fleek
in retrospect , the attempt to merge the millennial zeitgeist with tennessee politics was awkward from the start
witness bredesens cringe-inducing tweet the day after the endorsement , with mashed-together political cliches and lyrical puns far worse than anything blackburn attempted on fox & friends.
.votemarsha , look what you made her do
taylorswift13 doesnt like your little games and she wants tennesseans to know that youve been in the swamp long enough
its time for some fresh air up in washington
these two tennessee women voted for the candidate who has proven himself to be reasonable and trustworthy
we want leadership , not fear-based extremism
early voting goes til thursday and election day is november 6
please dont sit this one out
