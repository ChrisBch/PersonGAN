president trump on saturday re-upped his offer to help rep. nancy pelosi ( d-calif. ) become house speaker in the next congress by rallying republican members to vote for her this time its not so obvious that hes joking
democratic rep. moulton draws fire for campaign to deny pelosi speakers job
trump , after all , has vilified pelosi as much as anyone over the years , warning days before the election that she would abolish borders and impose socialism if her party won and she gained power
her toxic image on the right side of the political spectrum is part of the reason many democrats have qualms about making her speaker after the party gained a thin majority in last weeks election
but the president sounded more serious saturday when he again made the offer , even going so far as to name rep. tom reed ( n.y. ) as a republican who might vote for her
i can get nancy pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be speaker of the house
she deserves this victory , she has earned it - but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away
she will win
pelosi is trying to rally support ahead of the democratic caucus vote on nov. 28
she could come up short in the vote among incoming freshmen to congress and party holdovers , as many campaigned for the midterms saying they would not support her as the next speaker
this could push the issue to a house floor vote on jan. 3
if all house members are present and voting , pelosi will need 218 votes that day to become the next speaker , a post she lost when republicans claimed the majority in 2011
democrats are expected to control the 116th congress by a margin of about 16 seats , and at least 20 have said they would oppose her , according to a washington post analysis
that figure , however , could change , as pelosi and her allies lobby reluctant party members for their support
its the january vote where trump might actually be able to help if he can convince a handful of republican congress members to make up for the lost democrats
at a news media gaggle on saturday , he sounded seriously willing to do so whatever his reasons and whatever conditions , he might demand for the help
trump told reporters , according to a white house press pool report
asked which republicans would vote for her , trump again named reed , who has said he is pondering it
graphic does pelosi have the votes to become speaker
pelosi could potentially draw votes from some moderate republicans who have complained about how former speakers john boehner and paul d. ryan ran the house
im open to crossing over , rep. tom reed ( r-n.y. ) said
as chairman of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus , reed sits in a potential swing district and is working with moderate democrats on ambitious rules changes

pelosi , however , seems pretty confident she can do it on her own.
