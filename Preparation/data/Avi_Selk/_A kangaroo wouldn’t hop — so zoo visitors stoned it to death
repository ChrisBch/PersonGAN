a kangaroo was stoned to death in a chinese zoo apparently for the same reason that a brown bear was once crushed to death by russian videographers , and a shark in florida was dragged behind a motorboat like a kite
that is , to gratify a human
the kangaroo a 12-year-old female whose name is not known was not hopping enough to amuse spectators at the fuzhou zoo late last february , the new york times reported , quoting chinese media
so someone picked up a rock
or it might have been a brick or slab of concrete , agence france-presse wrote
in any case , it wasnt unusual for visitors to this zoo in southeast china to provoke animals with projectiles
by the time zookeepers rescued the kangaroo from the crowd , afp reported , her foot was nearly severed
one of the stones had ruptured the animals kidney , veterinarians discovered after the autopsy , the australian broadcasting corp. wrote
pics of the bricks that visitors hurled at kangaroos at the zoo in fujian , killing one and injuring another
zoo staff say visitors often throw objects at animals despite it being prohibited
had the attacks ended then , they might be no more sadistic than any other to occur at a chinese zoo , which afp reports are lightly regulated and therefore especially prone to abuse
last summer , for example , investors involved in a dispute with a zoo in jiangsu province released a donkey into the tiger pen , with predictable results
but the fuzhou stonings didnt end with that kangaroos death
just a few weeks later , the agency wrote , visitors attacked and injured a five-year-old roo for similar reasons
in nearly every media interview , zoo workers stressed that its against the rules to bludgeon the animal , but people keep doing it anyway
having apparently given up on the prospect of voluntary civility , afp wrote , the zoo now plans to install more security cameras
the zoo also plans to stuff and display the dead kangaroo as a sort of memorial to whatever it might now symbolize
other animal atrocities
video of gruesome bear-killing in russia goes viral and could be a crime
three men who laughed as they dragged a shark behind a motorboat could go to prison
a revered sea turtle was offered coins as a blessing
she ate them all and nearly died
