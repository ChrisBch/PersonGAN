hundreds of masked anarchists and black bloc affiliates were arrested in paris on tuesday , reuters reported , after rioters burned cars and smashed shop windows during the citys may day rally
what was once an event with roots as a spring festival in european pagan cultures has evolved into an international day of marches in the name of worker rights
but these may day celebrations have been regularly marred by violence since at least the 19th century , as the washington post noted on may 1 last year
paris got the worst of it this year
somewhere between 20,000 and 55,000 marchers gathered in the capital , according to reuters , intending to march peacefully against president emmanuel macrons plans to roll back labor protections
but about 1,200 masked and hooded protesters dressed in black stood on the sidelines , according to the news agency
some were anarchists , some waved soviet flags , and some were antifascists upset by a gathering of far-right european leaders in france on the same day
the gathering tipped into violence
the protesters colored smoke bombs mixed in the air with tear gas , water from police cannons and petrol bombs
before the chaos subsided , vehicles had been set on fire , windows at a mcdonalds smashed out , several shops looted and 200 people detained , reuters reported
four people , including a police officer , reportedly suffered minor wounds
when you come with molotov cocktails , its to burn cops , a police union official said , according to reuters
he added that the protesters had been allowed to target buildings , lest they be provoked into attacking people
those who wear hoods are the enemies of democracy , government spokesman benjamin griveaux said after the violence , according to reuters
the rioting recalled may day events from two years ago , when people angry at frances unemployment rate and unpopular socialist president turned pariss place de la republique into a scene of chaos
in other countries , demonstrators rallied on tuesday against perceived injustices
large gatherings were planned in cities across the united states to protest president trumps restrictive immigration policies , the associated press wrote
thousands of people in the u.s. territory of puerto rico marched against the federal government , deeply frustrated that tens of thousands of homes remain without power months after hurricane maria hit the island in september
the ap listed country after country in cambodia , garment workers organized the main rally
in istanbul , police detained protesters and forbade them from marching toward the main square , where 34 people were fatally shot on may day 1977
but in moscow , the ap wrote , it was not a day for outrage
about 10,000 paraded through the russian capital on may day in what the news agency called a show of power by russian authorities.
