asked to recall his graduation from the university of pennsylvania , donald trump obliged with so few details he might have been reading from a childrens book
we can fill in a few more details from the historical records of that ceremony exactly 50 years ago , may 20 , 1968 , the same year that 16,899 u.s. soldiers died at the peak of the vietnam war
trump posed for a photo that day with his beaming father , whose real estate fortune he was destined to inherit
not yet 22 , he half-smiled , and his arms hung limply from the cuffs of his robe
he wore a golden yellow fringe around his collar standard-issue for an economics major from the wharton school of finance and commerce and incidentally the same color he would one day use to decorate his penthouses , skyscrapers and the oval office
young trump waited in the philadelphia civic center with hundreds of classmates , all robed in their own symbolic colors and many , like him , about to face exposure to the vietnam draft for the first time in their lives
then trump accepted his bachelors degree and departed the pennsylvania campus
and the war never touched him
four months later , as the washington post has written , a previously undocumented foot condition effectively exempted trump from the draft
he almost immediately began to build his business empire , unimpeded by war or studies
the cult of personality that has lately formed around trump has used his acceptance into wharton , and some very broken math , to derive that he must be a genius with an iq of 156 to have studied at the ivy league business school
trump has never dispelled the idea , though the few anecdotes he has shared from his time at wharton sometimes conflict with recorded history
and more often , trump speaks of wharton with no details at all almost as an empty token of his brilliance and success
it became almost his mantra as he campaigned for president , repeated over and over to swelling crowds in different cities
trump says hes a genius
a study found these other presidents actually were
and if , on that morning in 1968 in his robe and his youth , trump had felt any fear at all of being exposed to a vicious war on the other side of the world , such thoughts have vanished from his latter-day accounts
the daily pennsylvanian once tried to find people who knew trump at wharton
of the 13 classmates the newspaper spoke to , it wrote , only one remembers seeing trump at all on campus.
the briefcase he carried around , which stuck out on campus as much as his suits
this was true
fewer than one in four freshman applicants got into wharton in the late 1960s , the globe wrote , and standards could have been even stricter for transfer students
trumps previous years of education had been turbulent his father had abruptly sent him to a military boarding school in eighth grade , the post wrote , after discovering the boy had been playing with switchblades to imitate a gang member
he nearly pushed a cadet out a window during a fight at the academy but emerged from high school as a passable potential heir to the family business
a classmate at wharton , louis calomaris , told the globe that a professor once asked students why they took his class
trump stood and announced , im going to be the king of new york real estate , calomaris recalled
several students rolled their eyes
he had few friends on campus , the globe wrote , and to the extent that he left any impression on anyone , it was often somewhere between aloof confidence and boastfulness
trump shunned parties , alcohol and ballgames , the globe wrote
he didnt even take a photo for the college yearbook
many off his schoolmates were protesting the vietnam war , but trump took no part in those marches
he lived off-campus in a rented , roach-infested apartment , and returned to new york most weekends to work with his father
michael dantonio wrote in his biography , the truth about trump.
ted sachs , who sometimes shared a fried oyster lunch with trump , told the daily pennsylvanian
candice bergen , destined to become an actress , went on a blind date with him
trump was nice , she told people years later , but it was a very short evening.
but he was becoming trump
he devoted the majority of his free time at penn to putting whatever lessons he gleaned from his classes to immediate use
with a $ 2 million loan from his father and various shell companies to conceal his identity , the globe wrote , trump purchased several properties in philadelphia building the beginning of his business empire in between business-school classes
on the morning of trumps graduation in 1968 the beginning , as he said his time at wharton amounted to a single line of text in the program , as part of a bachelor of science in economics list
donald john trump.
no deans list , no honors or distinctions of any kind
the vietnam war raged on , having peaked with the bloody tet offensive earlier in 1968 , but ultimately claiming the lives of more than 58,000 u.s. forces before it ended in 1975
a rush to wed to avoid the vietnam draft the day lbj eliminated the marriage
very briefly , the war threatened to derail trumps plans for his future in real estate
but by the end of the year , trump was once again safe from war , having reported for a military physical exam and failed it that september
as trump would later explain it , he had been excused from service because his doctor found bone spurs in one foot a temporary condition that left him , decades later , unable to recall which foot had been affected
his rivals mock him to this day as cadet bone spurs.
trump returned to penn 16 years after he graduated , in 1984 , to tell an overflowing lecture hall about his business success
when a student asked if trump would share his fortune with the school , he joked , ill match you dollar for dollar.
but he has donated to the school fairly regularly , the pennsylvanian reported up to $ 1.5 million by 2016 , though much of that generosity appeared to coincide with the attendance of trumps children at the college in the late 1990s and 2000s
all in all , there is little overt sign at the university of pennsylvania that donald john trump ever attended
she did not name trump , or mention that he graduated from the college , the atlantic wrote
still , trump has spent the last half-century reminding people of his time there
the new york times wrote its first profile of the trump organization and its dozens of apartment buildings in 1973 five years after trump graduated , and the same year that the united states began to withdraw from vietnam
this line somehow appeared in the story as fact
the times wrote when it profiled him again in 1984
this time , the newspaper noted that the claim contradicted university records , which showed that trump had not even made the honor roll
the school refused to comment on his grades , as it still does now
there are other gaps between the myth of trump at wharton and apparent reality
according to the times , in a local tv interview in 2011 , trump shared a rare anecdote from his days on campus about learning he might be drafted to fight in the vietnam war
a grisly photo of a saigon execution 50 years ago shocked the world and helped end the war
this could not have been true , the times wrote , because the first draft lottery was not held until 18 months after trump left wharton
the white house did not respond to an interview request from the washington post about trumps time at wharton
he has mentioned the school in public at least 93 times since early 2015 , by the pennsylvanians count but the more he speaks of it , the less he seems to say
he told an audience in arkansas during his 2016 campaign , the newspaper wrote.
got ta be very smart to get into that school , very smart.
that quote was no briefer than his other remarks about the school
this youtube compilation is fairly representative trump speaks of wharton as little more than a symbol of his greatness
as the actual school , penn administrators have consistently declined to comment on trump
when the atlantic asked around campus this month , it found no trump fans , and noted that nearly 4,000 alumni had signed an open letter telling the former student you do not represent us.
the university board , according to the pennsylvanian , has quietly issued written instructions to campus tour guides in the event a visitor asks about trump
if the visitors asks about trump attending penn , the instructions state , the tour guide is advised to reply , yes , he graduated from wharton in 1968 , and move on to other topics
these instructions , as published by the pennsylvanian , were illustrated with a photo of a latter-day trump at campaign rally pointing his finger in the air and twisting his face into a ridiculous sneer
he left no yearbook photo , after all
