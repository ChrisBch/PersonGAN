leaders of a syracuse university fraternity chapter have apologized for a leaked video in which a member swore an oath to always have hatred in my heart for black , hispanic and jewish people each referred to with unprintable slurs
but the oath was not serious , according to a statement that appeared on tau theta taus website early friday morning , after the university suspended the chapter
rather , the fraternity said , the video showed a satirical roast of its own members in particular of a conservative republican in the frat
the frats six-minute facebook video , which was first published wednesday by the student newspaper the daily orange , does in fact appear to be an attempt at someones idea of comedy
about a half-dozen members all new pledges , according to the fraternity are gathered on a makeshift stage
the sketch begins with a sort of origin myth a theta tau member has sex with a dog , and through consequent misadventures , is inducted into the fictional tri kappa frat
( kkk , get it )
a college party was so massive it crashed straight through the apartment floor
in the scene that has incited students across syracuse to protest the frat behind the video , the tri kappa leader stands before a theta tau member ( the same one who had sex with a dog earlier in the skit )
he makes the inductee kneel and asks
do you know the oath
f black people , says the inductee , who then says something similar about hispanics , but with a racial slur
youre close , says the leader.
i solemnly swear
i solemnly swear , repeats the inductee , who like the leader delivers his lines in an exaggerated southern accent
to always have hatred in my heart for
to always have hatred in my heart for
black people
the inductee repeats the word , which this newspaper can not , followed by another slur for hispanics , followed by much laughter from the audience
and most importantly says the leader , prompting the second man to complete the oath by using a slur for jewish people
a simulated sex act involving an aluminum can follows the oath , and the crowd applauds
syracuse suspends engineering fraternity for racist , anti-semitic , homophobic video
the university suspended tau theta tau on wednesday , the daily orange reported , shortly before the video leaked to the public
protesters across campus have demanded harsher punishment , and the university chancellor announced an investigation into behaviors deemed extremely racist , anti-semitic , homophobic , sexist , and hostile to people with disabilities.
the chapters website briefly went offline , according to the campus paper , but reappeared sometime before daybreak friday , with a long statement that began
the actual republican member , the statement said , was not racist , homophobic or otherwise intolerant
the statement apologized repeatedly , alternately explaining the context of the skit and assuring readers that theta tau was not trying to excuse the conduct
on saturday , syracuse chancellor kent syverud announced the permanent expulsion of the schools chapter of theta tau
there are seven other student groups under suspension , probation or other disciplinary measures at syracuse , according to the schools office of fraternity and sorority affairs
and its not the only byproduct , apparently
the newspaper says it has also obtained , but not yet published , videos in which theta tau members parody a mentally disabled man in a wheelchair and what one frat member describes as gay girly accents.
