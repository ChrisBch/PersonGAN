phoenix former vice president joseph r. biden and nfl star larry fitzgerald hailed john mccain as an authentic american hero thursday at a memorial service marked by tears , some laughter and a send-off to the strains of frank sinatras rendition of my way.
biden and fitzgerald headed a lineup of a half-dozen speakers at the service at north phoenix baptist church , the second of five days of events celebrating the life of mccain , who died of brain cancer saturday at age 81
the ceremony was attended by more than two-dozen of the arizona republicans current and former senate colleagues as well as former vice president dan quayle
while from very different worlds , we developed a meaningful friendship , said the arizona cardinals wide receiver
on friday , mccains body will lie in state at the u.s. capitol rotunda
the following day , former presidents barack obama and george w. bush are among those expected to deliver tributes at a memorial service for mccain at washington national cathedral
on sunday , the senator will be buried in a private funeral at the u.s
naval academy in annapolis
biden and mccain served together in the senate for more than two decades
the two foreign policy giants famously tangled on some of the most pressing national security issues
yet their close friendship transcended their policy differences
an emotional biden , who dabbed at tears with a handkerchief , spoke for a half-hour
my name is joe biden
im a democrat , he said as introduction , speaking at a church whose former pastor addressed the republican national convention in 2008 , when biden and mccain were on opposite tickets
and i loved john mccain , biden said to laughter
yet much of his speech was dark and deeply personal
bidens voice fell to a raspy whisper as he addressed mccains relatives by name and spoke of how brain cancer also killed his own son beau three years ago , and a car accident took his wife and daughter decades earlier
near the end of his speech , he quoted from john mccains final letter to the public as a balm against despair
the 34-year-old fitzgerald spoke about the unlikely friendship he struck up with a senator more than 40 years his senior
among the speakers thursday was grant woods , mccains former chief of staff , who retold one of the earliest anecdotes from the epic that was the senators life
it was about a prison guard in vietnam who showed mccain unexpected kindness by loosening the painful ropes around his wrists and , much later in his imprisonment , drawing a cross in the dirt for him as a sort of christmas gift
he told other stories , too about mccain , the bad driver , and mccain , the politician who knew how to apologize when he screwed up
woods concluded with an appeal to everyone in the room and probably the country
he kept the faith , woods concluded and drew a cross on the stage with his shoe
another speaker was tommy espinoza , godfather to james jimmy mccain , the senators youngest son
a registered democrat , espinoza runs a fund aimed at boosting investment in low-income latino communities and has supported the senators efforts at rewriting immigration laws
he recounted how john mccain crossed party lines by first inviting him to co-chair his campaign , then asking him to speak at the republican national convention
well , im a democrat , espinoza said he reminded mccain , to laughs from the audience.
ah , i dont care
i want you there , he said mccain replied
ahead of the service thursday morning , the line for people with tickets to sit in the public section wrapped halfway around the block-sized church
almost everyone was dressed in their finest suits , ties , dresses
tri le and his wife , helene nguyen , had come from mesa , ariz. , for the service
le said he and his wife came to the united states from vietnam a year ago seeking asylum , as he was a christian pastor in vietnam and had been arrested for practicing his faith
le was a child in the aftermath of the vietnam war and only vaguely knew of stories about the famous american captured by communists who loved his friends and refused to be released until they were
and so , he came to pay his respects
