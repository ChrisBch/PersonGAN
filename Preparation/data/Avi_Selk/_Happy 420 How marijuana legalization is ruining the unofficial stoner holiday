the legendary pot-judging contest called the cannabis cup has somehow managed to flourish under prohibition
maybe because prohibition was relatively simple
high times magazine brought the gathering to at least one u.s. city each year for most of this decade , even when recreational pot was illegal in all 50 states
local opposition was hardly an obstacle then
the cup drew thousands to a detroit jazz club in 2011 , even though suspicious police officers repeatedly intruded on what the detroit free press called its sealed medicating tent.
flash-forward to 2018 pot has been legalized in nine states since , including california this year
youd think this weekends cannabis cup in san bernardino , calif. , would be a smokeout to remember
well , that was the plan
and she failed
after a nearly 45-minute debate on wednesday , the san bernardino city council voted unanimously to deny the cannabis cup a marijuana permit forcing it to begin on friday with no drugs , or not begin at all
the shock vote also suggests that the once-underground pot movement , which kept u.s. cannabis culture alive through years of prohibition , may face even larger threats in the age of legalization

pot advocates say its time to grow up
high times , which this newspaper once compared to a playboy for drugs and the counterculture , launched the cannabis cup in the 1980s in amsterdam one of the few countries where it was broadly legal
the magazine has been holding the event in various u.s. cities since 2010 occasionally moving it when the contest offended local laws or sensibilities
the cup was forced out of los angeles in 2013 , for example , and out of denver three years later ironically after colorado and washington became the first states to legalize marijuana
san bernardino , in contrast , became a reliable haven for the cup
the washington posts marc fisher visited the event in 2014 , when it operated under californias medical marijuana laws , and observed what looked less like a medical convention than a days-long party
and so it went in san bernardino , year after year with no major complaints
until this year
in january , a 2016 proposition legalizing recreational marijuana across california finally went into effect
with new freedoms came , of course , new rules and regulations and a sort of catch-22 for high times
as explained at wednesdays meeting , the california bureau of cannabis control wont approve a marijuana event unless the local government issues organizers a permit first , two months in advance
but san bernardino didnt even have a system to issue marijuana permits until early april
high times , meanwhile , said it was confused by the new laws and had been trying to negotiate with the state before the city
that left ahmad , the magazines event director , standing before the council on wednesday evening , pleading at the last minute to let the contest go forward because several famous rappers and several thousand attendees were likely already on their way
but the council members , who apparently had not been consulted about any prior cannabis cup , turned increasingly hostile to the event as the meeting dragged on
asked council member fred shorett.

public support for marijuana legalization surged in 2016
said john valdivia , before trailing off.
how do we reconcile the state law versus the permit processing
there were no great answers
but by this point several council members were worried about passing an ordinance that might conflict with the states rules on short notice
said virginia marquez
im sitting here and being asked to break the law , added bessine richard
before the meeting , a high times spokesman had told nbc news that he expected the special permit to sail through
but by the end of the night , a clearly distressed ahmad watched as every single council member came out with a reason to vote against her from legal concerns to what one member called crap on the floor from attendees.
only two audience members appeared to be watching the meeting one of whom worked at a u-haul center across the street from the event and complained that it would block the parking
ahmad tried one last time
she admitted that high times might have erred in interpreting the new laws but implored the council to reward its good intentions
the council voted 6-0 to deny the requested permit
a member asked if the cup , set to begin on friday , would now be canceled
ahmad had no answer but seemed uncomfortable with the idea of a cannabis cup without cannabis

with a selection of brews this good youll certainly have a hoppy 4/20
but if levin was worried about the prospect of a cannabis convention with no cannabis license , he didnt show it he more than doubled the events previous crowd estimate from 20,000 up to 50,000 over the 4/20 weekend
another company executive , however , released a long and significantly more dire statement after the vote , calling the san bernardino city councils decision deeply regrettable.
brian rucker , senior vice president of events , said in the statement
but , rucker continued , new laws and provisions are impairing the rights of commerce and free expression for those lawful companies and citizens
these new provisions stand in stark defiance of the peoples will , as ratified by prop
64s full legalization of cannabis use and sale in 2016
further , the cannabis cup is held on fairgrounds governed by the urban agriculture incentive zone , under long-established provisions protecting farming and agriculture events
those laws prevent local municipalities from blocking or obstructing such gatherings
based on the agriculture incentive zone laws , we did not pursue a city license until this week , as the city adopted an ordinance requiring municipal approval only 8 days ago
given the 60 day lead time required for approval , the boards basis for denying the application , this put our brand in an impossible spot to meet all the required prerequisites
