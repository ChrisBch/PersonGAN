if the white house had qualms about openly challenging the first woman who accused supreme court nominee brett m. kavanaugh of sexual assault , its reservations disappeared the instant a second accuser spoke up
thats a night-and-day difference from the restraint the white house showed when kavanaughs first accuser went public a week earlier when president trumps surrogates urged her to tell her story to the senate panel reviewing the nomination
but then , kavanaughs confirmation seemed in less danger at the time
when the washington post on sept. 16 published christine blasey fords account that a teenage kavanaugh tried to rape her in the early 1980s , the white house pointed to the nominees denial but added no comment of its own
for nearly a week , the administration tried to keep kavanaughs confirmation on track without directly contradicting his accuser at least until trump broke the streak friday with a tweet challenging ford
some assumed that strategy had been in deference to the metoo movement , or out of fear of contradicting a womans memory of sexual assault
in any case , no such restraint has been shown to ramirez , who says kavanaugh assaulted her at a dorm party at yale university about two years after he allegedly attacked ford
a cosby accusers powerful message for christine blasey ford
what you need to know , according to the white house , was a page full of talking points and quotes pulled from the article itself essentially everything the new yorker had written that cast doubt on ramirezs claim
the white house just sent out this sheet attempting to cast doubt on the most recent story in the new yorker that accuses brett kavanaugh of sexual misconduct
this was true , though the magazine also quoted two of ramirezs former classmates who remembered hearing about the alleged assault shortly after the party
the white house didnt mention that in its memo
if there was any doubt that the strategy to salvage kavanaughs nomination has become dramatically more aggressive , white house counselor kellyanne conway dispelled it early monday
one week earlier , conway had set the tone for the white houses restrained response to fords accusations when she argued that the accuser should not be insulted , she should not be ignored
conway didnt insult ramirez on monday
but when cbs asked if she thought ramirezs story might be made up , conway replied theres a great deal of suspicion
its unclear what prompted the white houses new tone whether it comes down to differences in the way it views the womens claims , or a growing fear that kavanaughs nomination could collapse under the weight of multiple allegations , or something else
where that tone comes from is more obvious
speaking to reporters monday at the united nations , trump not only challenged the second accusers motives but also applied his suspicions retroactively to the first
in my opinion , its totally political.
the worst is yet to come for kavanaughs accuser
take it from this sexual assault attorney
trump calls sexual misconduct allegations against kavanaugh totally political , vows to back him all the way
