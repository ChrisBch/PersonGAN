a letter in which albert einstein explicitly rejected god and religion will be auctioned in december for the second time since the famous physicist wrote it a year before his death
for decades , people had been debating the theorists concept of religion , in large part because they kept misunderstanding it
but he did not become an atheist
for einstein , the mystery in the architecture of the physical universe an architecture he helped reveal with his breakthroughs in relativity and the nature of space and time was more profound than any wonder he read about in the talmud or the bible
einstein scribbled his theory of happiness in place of a tip
it just sold for more than $ 1 million
he wrote in an essay in 1931
and for einstein , the deepest secrets of the universe were as unknowable as the mind of god was to a theologian
so the physicist read with interest a book published in 1952 by the philosopher eric gutkind that attempted to marry jewish spirituality and intellectualism , arguing that the pursuit of science could and would lead people to a complete understanding of god
einsteins review was polite but pretty savage
he wrote to gutkind in 1954 before delivering his line about human weaknesses and primitive legends.
in 2012 , the letter showed up again on ebay for an asking price of at least $ 3 million but apparently never sold
the auction house christies expects that the letter will sell for $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million when it goes on sale in new york in early december , after public viewings
in case the excerpts above have given the impression that einsteins letter is a polemic , its really not
whatever his views on religion , he maintained a deep respect for what he called religious geniuses and said that religion was necessary to guide people between right and wrong
science can only ascertain what is , not what should be , as he put it
so while einstein spent a paragraph or two criticizing gutkinds understanding of the universe , he praised what he called gutkinds factual attitude to life and to the human community.
the physicist wrote in conclusion.
with friendly thanks and best wishes , yours , a. einstein.
