his arrest in a sleepy sacramento suburb offered a shocking , abrupt development in what had long been one of the most notorious unsolved string of crimes in u.s. history
the gruesome attacks unfolded across california for more than a decade during the 1970s and 1980s , shattering families and frightening communities
then the crimes stopped , remaining a mystery for a generation , with little sign the case would ever be solved
the trail suddenly and ultimately led authorities to deangelo , a former police officer living in citrus heights , a city outside sacramento
authorities said deangelo who was an officer during the years when police believe the attacks began was found through dna evidence obtained in recent days
though investigators declined to elaborate on what the dna evidence was or how it was obtained , they said it clearly linked him to the crimes that had transfixed them for so long
authorities said deangelos name had not been on their radar at any point until last week , but that they were able to link him to homicides and rapes from decades ago
sacramento county court records showed that deangelo was booked into jail early wednesday morning on two counts of murder
no bail was set , and it was not known if he had an attorney
deangelo was also charged wednesday with four counts of murder in orange county
michelle mcnamara stalked the golden state killer until she died
some think her work led to the suspects arrest
the string of attacks for decades were actually considered three separate sprees , beginning in the mid-1970s in visalia , calif. , authorities said , when dozens of home invasions and burglaries led people to call the then-unknown assailant the visalia ransacker.
then a series of slayings involving couples in their homes in southern california by the golden state killer lasted up into the mid-1980s
it wasnt until 2001 that authorities connected the crimes via dna evidence
through 1986 , the fbi said , the attacker killed a dozen people and raped 45
the victims were as young as 13 and as old as 41 , they said
investigators had said they thought the golden state killer may have had a law enforcement background , and deangelo fit that bill
between 1973 and 1979 , deangelo served as a police officer in two different california police departments , said sacramento county sheriff scott jones
the timeline meant that deangelo was a law enforcement official when the attacks began , learning how to be a police officer at the same time authorities now believe he was beginning an escalating reign of terror
it remains unclear whether this training and knowledge of law enforcement tactics played a role in how the case stayed unsolved for so long
jones said wednesday
jones said deangelo had worked for the exeter , calif. , police department between 1973 and 1976 , a department located about 10 miles east of visalia
john hall , the citys police chief , said in an interview wednesday that no one currently with the department was there at the time
still , he said , the idea that deangelo might have worked for the department was a blow
the case remained an object of intense focus for many in law enforcement and the public over the years
in 2016 , the fbi made a renewed plea and offered a $ 50,000 reward for help in finding what they called the violent and elusive individual.
beginning in 1976 , the golden state killer is believed to have raped dozens of women in their homes meticulously planning intrusions , sometimes ambushing entire families , and killing several victims toward the end of the bloodshed , all before vanishing in 1986
the attacker also was behind numerous residential burglaries in the state , the fbi said
for relatives of the victims , the shock of deangelos arrest and the charges against him left some feeling a sense of closure
others were overwhelmed by the sudden news
jennifer carole was sleeping in her santa cruz home when the text came in at 7:11 a.m. on wednesday
when she awoke , she could hardly believe it
could this really be him
a friend had typed out and sent a link to a news article
almost four decades after caroles father , lyman smith , and stepmother , charlene smith , were found murdered in their ventura , calif. , home , police said they had found a suspect
she was torn by conflicting emotions
carole said it was a chilling feeling to know the alleged killer had been in the sacramento area the whole time , the same area her mother and father had lived
in march 1980 , her brother had gone to their fathers home to mow the lawn , but he grew suspicious when the homes alarm didnt go off when he entered
he went upstairs to check on his father and stepmother , carole said , and called police after he found sheets pulled up over their bodies
i hope to god he confesses , said carole , who was 18 at the time , of the man now in police custody
in citrus heights , residents recalled strange encounters with deangelo , who neighbors said lived in a home with his daughter and granddaughter
attempts to reach deangelos relatives were unsuccessful
eddy verdon recalled meeting deangelo after moving to the area and found him to be nosy , eventually discovering deangelo on his property three years ago
when he heard someone around the property and looked in the garage , he found deangelo ready to flee on his bicycle
since the attacker seemingly disappeared , investigators and amateur detectives have searched for him across the united states and inquired as far away as australia
the crime writer michelle mcnamara wrote in a los angeles magazine profile of the old cases
if theyve really caught the goldenstatekiller i hope i get to visit him
not to gloat or gawk to ask him the questions that truecrimediary wanted answered in her letter to an old man at the end of illbegoneinthedark
police first dubbed the man the east area rapist , since they do not believe he began to kill people until later
the first known attack took place in the middle of the night in the summer of 1976 , when a man slipped into a home in east sacramento county , raped a young woman and left
authorities said the same man raped someone again a few weeks later , then raped people again and again
after a year , two dozen women had been attacked in the sacramento area
one victim was said to be a 13-year-old girl whose family was home at the time
two people were beaten to death with a fireplace log
brian and katie maggiore were gunned down while walking their dog in rancho cordova
a man and his girlfriend were fatally shot in his condo , with a cellophane-wrapped turkey carcass found on the patio
the killer , mcnamara later wrote , had eaten some of their leftover christmas dinner before departing
the last known victim was 18-year-old janelle cruz , who was raped and bludgeoned to death in irvine in 1986
