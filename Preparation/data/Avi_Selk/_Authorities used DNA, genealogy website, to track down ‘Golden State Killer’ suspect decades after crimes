the golden state killer was meticulous at his crime scenes over the course of a decade and in several cities , leaving scant evidence for police
there were no fingerprints
few saw his face
and what he did leave his dna was , at the time , not useful to police
four decades later , with far better dna technology and widespread use of it , that genetic material became critical to possibly solving one of the most vexing serial murder sprees in u.s. history
authorities said they were able to link their suspect to the string of crimes by using a genealogy service to trace the genetic material to one man they believe killed at least a dozen people joseph james deangelo
while the details of how the search unfolded were not immediately clear , grippi told the news organizations that a genetic profile from one of deangelos distant relatives led investigators to him
we found the needle in the haystack golden state killer suspect arrested after sudden dna match
once they narrowed their search based on deangelos age , where he had lived and his likeness to sketches victims had helped develop over the years authorities were able to follow him and ultimately collected his dna on a discarded item
the dna match meant they had their chief suspect
grippi did not identify the company or companies involved , but such services are increasingly used by people who submit their own genetic information to learn more about their ancestry and family tree
23andme said the company was not involved and does not give customer information to law enforcement officials
grippis office confirmed the sacramento bee report but declined to provide additional information
california authorities have begun compiling numerous cases against deangelo , charging the navy veteran with slayings and rapes that spanned years and stretched the length of california
officials suggested thursday that additional counts are likely to follow in cases that included dozens of victims who were attacked in the 1970s and 1980s
deangelos arrest was sudden and stunning , coming more than three decades after the horrific attacks that terrorized californians in the 1970s and 1980s ended abruptly , the elusive attacker apparently vanishing and later presumed arrested on other charges or dead
the suburban grandfather police say was responsible remains largely a mystery even after his arrest
officials said that between 1976 and 1986 , the golden state killer also known as the east area rapist and the original night stalker carried out a campaign of shocking brutality , killing a dozen people and raping 45
deangelo , who police said was arrested without incident at his home in citrus heights , calif. , is scheduled to make his first court appearance friday
it was not clear whether he had an attorney
small details about deangelos life have begun to take shape , with neighbors painting him as an angry and unsettling man and noting that it was chilling that he chose to live in and around the communities he allegedly terrorized
deangelo had spent much of the 1970s employed as a police officer in two california cities
he worked for the exeter police department between 1973 and 1976 , authorities said
a newspaper article announcing his hiring at the time described him as a new york native who joined the navy and served in vietnam
during those years , a slew of house invasions linked to a then-unknown assailant dubbed the visalia ransacker took place about 10 miles from the police departments headquarters
authorities said deangelo left the exeter force and worked for the auburn police department between 1976 and 1979 , when that department said his employment was terminated
news reports from the time say he was fired after he was caught shoplifting a hammer and dog repellent
what deangelo did between being fired by the auburn police force and getting hired by save mart a decade later remained unclear
attacks in that area linked to the spree began during those years , police said
all we know about joseph deangelo , the golden state killer suspect who became a suburban grandfather
deangelo is facing at least eight murder charges filed by prosecutors in three counties , according to court records
the sacramento county district attorneys office charged him with a pair of killings in 1978 , while the ventura county district attorney charged him with two more in 1980
the orange county district attorneys office has charged deangelo with killing four people there between august 1980 and may 1986
among those is a charge for the death of janelle cruz , an 18-year-old raped and killed in irvine , calif. , who was the last-known victim authorities attributed to the golden state killer
she stalked the golden state killer until she died
some think her work led to the suspects arrest
joyce e. dudley , the santa barbara county district attorney , noted that among the golden state killers victims were four people slain in the city of goleta , which is in her jurisdiction
dudley said in a statement
since about 1990 , deangelo worked for save mart , the grocery chain , according to a company spokeswoman
deangelo , a mechanic , retired last year after 27 years of work at save marts roseville , calif. , distribution center , she said
decades passed , but former sacramento county sheriffs office detective richard shelby said he always had faith the golden state killer would be caught
shelby , 79 , was one of the first detectives on the trail , and he kept consulting and working on the case even after he retired
shelby was originally assigned to investigate the sacramento-area rape of jane carson-sandler in her home in october 1976
he said he quickly suspected it was the work of a serial predator
shelby said deangelo was never on the radar screens of investigators as a possible suspect in the 1970s
the suspect was careful not to leave fingerprints at crime scenes , shelby said , but did sometimes leave dna behind
shelby said that oversight which ultimately led to deangelos arrest likely was the result of dna testing not having been developed at the time
shelby said he doubts the suspect would have left such evidence at crime scenes if he were still operating today
deangelos relatives who authorities say are cooperating could not be reached for comment
in citrus heights , where deangelo lived , neighbors recalled him as a nosy presence
one said that he found the elderly man intruding on his property a few years ago and that he fled on a bicycle when confronted
others described deangelo as filled with rage
gormans mother , sonja , told the newspaper that deangelo was the kind of person you didnt want to make mad.
cyndee reed , who said her husband survived an attack by the golden state killer , came to citrus heights after deangelo was arrested
reed said her husband and his first wife were found bound , naked and assaulted in their home
i know the trauma that my husband lived through.
