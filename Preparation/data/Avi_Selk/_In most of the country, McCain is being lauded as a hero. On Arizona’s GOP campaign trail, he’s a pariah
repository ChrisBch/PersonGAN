its possible to imagine a world in which sen. john mccains illness and death in office would send all three republican candidates for arizonas other u.s. senate seat racing to praise him and stake some claim to his immense legacy
the insurgent conservative candidate , kelli ward , might compare her open-press bus tour and unfiltered speaking style to mccains old presidential campaigns his famous straight talk express.
former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio might use his stump speeches to compare his decades-long political career in arizona to mccains
and rep. martha mcsally the pollsters favorite to win might be comparing her rsum of military and congressional experience to that of the vietnam war pilot and prisoner who became a washington powerhouse
the reality is not even close
the arizona republican party that nurtured mccain and his retiring senate colleague jeff flake , whose seat those candidates are seeking , has been overrun by the party of donald trump
for republican candidates now , the imperative is to embrace the president lest they lose his voters and many of those voters share trumps antipathy to mccain
in 2018 , the republican candidates have chosen to try to maximize the vote of the partys invigorated populist base and hope that the burgeoning numbers of latino and suburban voters in arizona are not energized against them
ward built her national profile by attacking mccain and not just for his relatively moderate immigration policies and vote against repealing the affordable care act
before mccain was diagnosed with brain cancer , ward called him an an 80-year-old man near the end of life.
when he was diagnosed last summer , she urged him to step away as quickly as possible , and continued to criticize him for missing senate votes during hospital stays
when the senators office announced one day before his death on saturday that he had stopped treatment for cancer , ward suggested he had timed the announcement to interfere with her campaign bus tour
she has since deleted that facebook post and offered her condolences , but is hardly apologetic
as of sunday afternoon , wards campaign website bore no mention of mccains death , and was still promoting an old statement that calls him a problem for president trumps agenda.
arpaio , meanwhile , has spent as much time coming up with creative ways to imprison immigrants as mccain has spent seeking compromises on border enforcement
as a sheriff , he once bragged of building a concentration camp for illegals.
he is only free to run for the senate because trump pardoned him after a conviction related to immigration roundups
arpaio did take a break from criticizing the senator last week to offer some kind words in mccains final hours
but hours later , according to the arizona republic , arpaio raged at mccains soon-to-be-widow for blocking him on twitter
both ward and arpaio have also tried to link mcsally to mccain , and routinely lump both in with flake , another trump critic who spent sunday recounting his fidelity to mccain on news shows
mcsally while not openly attacking mccain has hardly spoken of him at all as her campaign has tilted further and further to the right
once more publicly moderate and critical of trump , she has fully embraced the president during her campaign
mccains daughter meghan was sharply critical of the congresswoman this month after she mimicked trump and neglected to mention the full name of the john s. mccain national defense authorization act.
meghan mccain wrote
snubs and policies aside , all three republican hopefuls have embraced and won the favor of trump , who has been publicly critical of mccain since his campaign for president
ward and arpaio have increased their appeal to the presidents base by openly flirting with conspiracy theories and far-right provocateurs plucked straight from the so-called trump internet
mccain , for his part , had followed in the path trod by other classically conservative political figures in arizona , such as the longtime senator and 1964 presidential nominee barry goldwater
some analysts expect mccains death will only hasten the states political transformation
said david wells , a professor of politics at arizona state university
for years , democrats have hoped that shifting demographics could turn republican-dominated states like arizona blue
its yet to happen , but wells thinks its a real possibility in the near future as mccain and flake are replaced by republicans further to the right
a few months from now , one of the three trump-aligned candidates will face off against a democrat running against the president , his border wall and nearly everything he stands for
but before that election , there will be another opportunity to demonstrate the gop shift
doug ducey will appoint a replacement to fill mccains seat until 2020 , when a special election will determine the occupant until 2022 , when mccains term would have ended
several of the alternatives are more right-leaning than mccain and another is cindy mccain , the late senators widow
