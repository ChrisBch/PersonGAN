two women drowned in the back of a sheriffs van tuesday when deputies tried to drive down a south carolina road flooded by tropical storm florence
the horry county sheriffs office described the women as detainees but later clarified they were mental patients who had been involuntarily committed for treatment
he said the sheriffs van picked up wendy newton , 45 , and nicolette green , 43 , at a hospital in loris a small town north of myrtle beach that lacked a mental-health ward
( a county spokeswoman said they had actually been picked up in conway , about 20 miles southeast of loris )
the van was bound for florence , about an hours drive northwest in good conditions
but that afternoon , in the storms aftermath , it wound through a treacherous maze of closed roads and floodwaters pouring off the pee dee river and its tributaries
the van was only halfway to florence by early evening , when it went underwater near highway 76 and pee dee island road
in a statement , the sheriffs office said two deputies escaped from the cab and tried to get the women out of the back
while some news reports said the women were chained up , a county spokeswoman said they were only bound by seat belts
the countys statement reads
by the time a rescue team arrived , the deputies were stranded on top of the van
it was too late for the women
richardson said a diver was able to get a look at the bodies , but as of wednesday afternoon the van and women remained submerged
a dive team was assembling to extract the women as he spoke , and the county announced late wednesday that greens and newtons remains had been recovered , though the van remained submerged
horry county referred questions about the incident including whether the women had been locked in the van to state investigators , who said they had no new information to release
green had lived in myrtle beach and newton in shallotte , n.c. , according to the coroner
their deaths push florences toll across three states to nearly 40 victims
