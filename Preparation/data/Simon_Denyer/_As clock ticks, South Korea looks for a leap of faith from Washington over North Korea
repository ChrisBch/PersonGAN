seoul on the militarized front line dividing the korean peninsula , south korea has been busy bulldozing and blowing up some of its guard posts
it is a symbol of what seoul hopes will be a new era of relations with pyongyang
but it is also one of the few steps south korea can take to build confidence with the north without violating u.n. sanctions or going against its u.s. allies and protectors
in south korea , frustration is building that its efforts to improve relations with north korea have not been matched with a corresponding improvement in ties between pyongyang and washington
indeed , five months after president trump met north korean leader kim jong un in singapore , there are worrying signs of backsliding
a meeting between secretary of state mike pompeo and his north korean counterpart , kim yong chol , was canceled at the last minute earlier this month
and as the united states resumed small-scale military exercises with the south korean military , north korean media warned the country could restart its nuclear program unless sanctions were lifted
dprk today , a state-sponsored website , said monday , also complaining about recent military exercises with japan involving nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and bombers
those illogical tactics wont work , it said
in seoul , the government is wary of criticizing the united states directly
but behind the scenes , there is a real sense that washington needs to move the needle forward by building trust with the north
opinion as expected , north korea played trump for a fool
said lee soo-hyuck , a ruling-party lawmaker who led south koreas negotiations with the north a decade and a half ago.
i really hope the united states has some novel idea.
there is a fundamental disagreement between washington and seoul about how we arrived at this point
the trump administration credits its maximum pressure campaign for forcing pyongyang to the negotiating table
south koreas government says it was president moon jae-in and trumps joint efforts to extend the hand of friendship to kim
from that disagreement comes discord about how to move the process forward
vice president pence told nbc news last week that it is absolutely imperative that when kim next meets trump , he hand over a verifiable plan to disclose his nuclear and weapons sites , open them for inspection and dismantle them
now we need to see results , pence said
it is an approach the south koreans say is premature
there is understandable wariness in washington about trusting a regime that has never demonstrated its trustworthiness in the past and has not renounced a january pledge to move from testing to mass production of warheads and missiles
but some experts say the united states also is at risk of missing an opportunity to reduce tensions on the korean peninsula and explore just how far kim is prepared to go in cutting his nuclear arsenal in return for better relations and economic development
robert carlin , a visiting scholar at stanford university who was involved in u.s.-north korea talks from 1992 to 2000 , said its unrealistic to expect north korea to allow thousands of u.s. investigators to roam its country at will
washington also needs to be more aware of how its rhetoric plays in the north , he said
joseph yun , former u.s. special representative for north korea , said washington was guilty of a tremendous amount of mixed messaging between trump and other members of the administration and those under trump were guilty of being way too uncompromising.
recent articles in north korean state media suggest doubts may be surfacing in pyongyang about whether kims more conciliatory approach to washington is bearing fruit , experts say
yun , the former special representative , said the united states should consider opening liaison offices with north korea but ultimately should talk to pyongyang about sanctions relief
