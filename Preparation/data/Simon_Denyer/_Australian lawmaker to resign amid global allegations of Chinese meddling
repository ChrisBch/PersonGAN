beijing australia 's attempt to curb china 's growing influence in its political system claimed its first scalp on tuesday , as a prominent opposition lawmaker pledged to quit over allegations that he was bought by chinese money
relations between australia and china have nosedived in the past week , since prime minister malcolm turnbull 's government moved to ban foreign political donations , citing disturbing reports about chinese influence on australian politics
the row between canberra and beijing comes at a time of heightened concern about covert attempts by the chinese communist party to influence politics and academia around the globe , from the united states and germany to singapore and new zealand
china has responded fiercely to events in australia
the foreign ministry pronounced itself astounded by the australian prime minister 's remarks , which it said lacked principle and had poisoned the relationship between the two countries
the people 's daily newspaper , mouthpiece of the ruling communist party , went even further monday , accusing the australian media of hysterical paranoia and racism for its role in exposing the communist party 's covert actions
as the fight played out , influential opposition politician sam dastyari vowed tuesday to quit for the good of his party after becoming embroiled in a scandal over his links to a wealthy chinese business executive
the labor party senator was accused of endorsing china 's controversial actions in the disputed south china sea , against his party 's platform , in return for support from donor huang xiangmo
he was also reported to have given huang advice on how to evade australian surveillance and to have unsuccessfully tried to pressure labor 's deputy leader not to meet a hong kong pro-democracy activist in 2015
china still trying to hack u.s. firms , experts say
australian cabinet minister peter dutton accused dastyari on monday of being a double agent of china , although he had not broken any laws in accepting foreign money at that time
experts said australia 's moves to close a legal loophole that had allowed foreign donations reflected a belated realization of china 's growing influence , after years of complacency when the australian economy benefited hugely from chinese demand for natural resources
it 's a necessary correction , but it has played out at quite a shrill pitch , said euan graham , director of the international security program at the lowy institute in sydney
the government did n't want to confront this situation until it had to , and now it 's playing catch-up
nevertheless , the concerns are keenly felt in australia as china becomes more assertive internationally , notably in defense of what it sees as its key interests regarding tibet , taiwan , hong kong and the south china sea
evidence of russian attempts to influence last year 's u.s. election has also heightened concerns in australia
david kelly , research director at the china policy analysis firm in beijing , said china is becoming more proactive internationally in the wake of last month 's communist party congress , which officially granted president xi jinping another five years in power
but china has not handled the dispute well , he said
china appears to be unable to accept a criticism of its government without calling it racist , kelly said
it follows a pattern we have seen in the past two years , where china speaks a great deal about having the right to be heard internationally
but it is not doing much in the way of listening carefully
china has also been accused of organizing its citizens studying in australia to support its foreign policy positions and protest academics perceived to be anti-china
critics say beijing tries to silence chinese dissidents who have taken australian citizenship
china is easily australia 's biggest trading partner , buying $ 70 billion worth of its goods and services last year
kelly said he did not expect a lasting impact on the relationship between the two countries because economic and trade tries have a lot more momentum than people think
the problem for australia is that china 's willingness to use coercion to achieve its dream of renewed greatness is becoming a defining feature of its foreign policy , he wrote in the australian , a newspaper
with the u.s. in self-declared retreat from its global leadership role and lacking a coherent asia policy under donald trump , there are diminishing external constraints on chinese behavior and ambitions
elsewhere , concerns about chinese influence over academia erupted in august after britain 's cambridge university press announced that , at the request of beijing , it had removed 300 articles and book reviews from a version of the china quarterly website available in china
it reversed the decision after a backlash
on sunday , the head of germany 's domestic intelligence agency accused china of using fake accounts on the linkedin networking site to gather personal information about thousands of german officials and politicians with the aim of cultivating them as sources
china 's foreign ministry called those claims baseless
