beijing almost exactly five years ago , a newly anointed president xi jinping met his russian counterpart , vladimir putin , and declared that they shared similar personalities.
the comment , reported by the kremlin news service but not by chinese state media , went largely unnoticed at the time
but on sunday , the parallels between the two leaders were too stark to ignore
chinas communist party is to abolish a two-term limit on the presidency , state media announced , potentially opening the door for xi to rule for life
in that simple step , the communist party showed that it has forgotten one of the main lessons of the despotic rule of mao zedong , wrote jerome cohen , a chinese legal expert and new york university professor , in a blog post
china proposes abolishing presidential term limits
there was no fanfare surrounding the news here indeed , it was buried within an article about much less portentous constitutional arrangements on page 2 of mondays print edition of the party newspaper , the peoples daily
censors also got to work to prevent any popular debate
the freeweibo.com website , which monitors content censored from weibo , chinas version of twitter , cited key phrases that were being deleted , including serving another term in office , amendment to the constitution , and ascending the throne.
some people reacted with humor , circulating a disney weibo post from 2013 showing winnie-the-pooh gleefully hugging a huge pot of honey , with the caption , find the thing you love and stick with it.
winnie-the-pooh is a common nickname for xi
the bears name , and disney , were also among the leading censored terms monday , freeweibo.com showed
li datong , a former editor who lost his job more than a decade ago in a row over censorship , issued a public letter monday calling on delegates to next months annual meeting of the national peoples congress to vote down the proposal
experts said the news would send a chill through the chinese legal and academic community , already beset by the most severe crackdown on dissent and free speech in decades
xi is a big admirer of putin , said willy lam , a professor at the chinese university of hong kong and an expert on chinas politics
this nationalist agenda fits well with rising nationalism among chinas youth , he added
he told a meeting of the partys central leadership on saturday
in other words , if xi stays , the constitution has to reflect that
nor is xi a man to rule behind the scenes , as deng xiaoping did in the 1980s , balancing competing interests but holding ultimate authority
xi is a man who demands to be center stage , with a firm grip on all the levers of power , experts said
that power actually stems from xis role as general secretary of the communist party , bolstered by his status as chairman of the central military commission
there is no term limit on his role as general secretary
but his global stature also depends on his title as president and xi is not about to surrender that spotlight to a medvedev-type subordinate , especially one who might one day grow too big for his boots , experts said
there is a potential upside to all of this
xi has already used his power to implement a far-reaching crackdown on corruption , even if it has also been used to instill obedience and eliminate rivals
he is equally determined to improve the way the party governs china , eliminate poverty and even improve the countrys poisoned environment
but in this vision , there is no room for checks and balances , or for dissent or protest , experts said
the risks are obvious
joseph stalin and mao both illustrated the dangers of centralizing too much power in one mans hands , because one lonely man at the top can easily become paranoid
but autocratic rulers who do not allow feedback from the grass roots tend to make mistakes
robert daly , director of the kissinger institute on china and the united states , wrote in a discussion on the chinafile website
increased pressure on officials to deliver on targets could lead to more falsification of data , wrote yanmei xie at gavekal dragonomics in a client note , or more clumsy and unsettling attempts to demonstrate compliance at all costs
thats a real risk in a country whose economic growth figures are already largely discredited , and where mao was told grain production was booming during a famine that killed tens of millions of people
the trivium consultancy in beijing headlined its client note monday with a simple quote from deng
