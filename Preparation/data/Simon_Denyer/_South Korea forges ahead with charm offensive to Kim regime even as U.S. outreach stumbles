seoul the enthusiasm and optimism of the south korean government over its outreach to the north is on open display
a huge image of president moon jae-ins first meeting in april with north korean leader kim jong un adorns seouls city hall
photo booths around the city allow people to pose against summit backdrops
and on tuesday , moon heads to pyongyang to meet kim for the third time this year
this much is clear moons administration is leading the cheerleading about the dramatic diplomatic advances even as u.s. exchanges with the north appear to stumble
only by building trust , moons supporters argue , will kim be convinced to dismantle his nuclear weapons program
this approach stands in sharp contrast to views from within the trump administration that kim must take it all down before u.s. largesse can kick in
moons government says such hard-line stances in the past have been a total failure.
the south , instead , has opted to court kims regime gradually
the easiest items came first family reunification events , cultural and sports exchanges and south korean business forums to look at a post-sanctions peninsula
north korea blasts smear campaign over alleged hacking
recent days have brought a possible move into harder and more substantial rapprochement with the opening of a quasi-diplomatic liaison office that allows round-the-clock communications between the two sides for the first time since the korean war
national security council director chung eui-yong told a defense forum in seoul on thursday
it is an outside-the-box strategy that just might work
but it also causes disquiet within trumps administration , among south korean conservatives and in the regions other cornerstone u.s. ally , japan
the moon governments interactions with the north often sidestep the fact that kim still leads the worlds most repressive totalitarian regime
the souths eagerness to embrace the north korea leader also has left trumps maximum pressure campaign in some disarray , critics point out
the fraying is most evident with china , the linchpin in the coalition that the u.s. president painstaking built last year to persuade kim to negotiate
beijing is enforcing international sanctions less aggressively this year , experts on north koreas economy say
trumps starting a trade war with beijing has not helped
critics of trump also point out that there were no clear timetables or benchmarks set in trumps landmark singapore summit with kim in june
said shin beom-chul , a senior fellow at the asan institute for policy studies in seoul
north korea u.s. still plotting regime change with smile on its face
there was talk of a precious moment in history , and of the korean peninsula making a huge contribution to world peace
but skeptics see north korea pocketing the goodies on offer from seoul and washington including a suspension of u.s.-south korean military exercises without offering irreversible , verifiable concessions in return
meanwhile , pyongyang is adept at exploiting divisions between countries , or even within the u.s. administration itself between trump and others who prefer more cautious moves with kim
still , there are those in seoul who are convinced that kim understands that opening up the economy is the only way for his government to survive
yoon young-kwan , a professor at seoul national university and former foreign minister , is among them
he notes that kim apparently told a team of south korean envoys this month that he hopes to achieve denuclearization before the end of trumps term
presidential adviser moon chung-in was one of the architects of the sunshine policy of engagement with north korea two decades ago
he also has faith in kim but argues that the question of whether he is sincere is , at this point , irrelevant
