beijing seven chinese middle school students died and 12 more were injured friday when a man wielding a knife attacked them outside their school in northwestern china , the local government said
the attack happened around 6:10 p.m. outside a school in the town of mizhi in shaanxi province , according to the local countys weibo social media account
a 28-year-old man surnamed zhao has been taken into custody , local police said
the injured students are receiving emergency treatment at a hospital
the mizhi county government said zhao had studied at the school , where he had been bullied
china has strict gun-control laws , but this has not prevented puzzling attacks on schools in recent years by people with grievances against society or with mental health issues
in june , a 22-year-old school dropout detonated a bomb outside a kindergarten in the city of xuzhou , in the eastern coastal province of jiangsu , killing eight people , including himself
sociologists have blamed the attacks on the stresses caused by a society undergoing rapid change , with rising inequality and huge pressures on young people to compete and succeed
they have also cited a lack of support for the mentally ill and a dysfunctional legal system in which people who feel theyve been treated unfairly or have suffered injustice have few avenues to seek redress
