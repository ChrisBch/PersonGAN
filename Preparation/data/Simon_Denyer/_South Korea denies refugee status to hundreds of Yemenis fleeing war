seoul south korea denied refugee status wednesday to hundreds of yemeni asylum seekers who had fled their war-torn country , allowing them to stay only on one-year humanitarian visas
more than 500 yemenis arrived on the resort island of jeju earlier this year , taking advantage of the islands visa-free tourism policy
but their presence sparked an anti-immigrant backlash in ethnically homogenous south korea
on wednesday , seouls justice ministry granted 339 yemenis one-year humanitarian permits to stay , acknowledging that their right to life and personal liberty would be put at risk if they were deported
the ministry rejected permits for 34 others who face criminal charges or were judged to have sought asylum for economic reasons , and it postponed a decision on 85 others
the 339 will now be allowed to leave jeju and travel to the korean mainland
their visas will be subject to review in a year if they wish to extend their stays
advocacy groups and lawyers condemned the decision , saying it will hardly address the precarious situation the refugees face
said lee il , a human rights lawyer with the seoul-based refugee rights network
last year , south koreas justice ministry completed reviews for 6,015 asylum seekers and rejected all but 91 of them
it granted stay permits to 23 other yemenis in september but has yet to grant refugee status to any of the 481 yemenis who have applied for it so far
some yemenis managed to leave jeju for the mainland before the government crackdown and have not applied for asylum yet
meanwhile , more than 1,200 syrians staying in south korea on humanitarian permits do not have proper access to medical care or education and can not invite their families to join them , lee said
the very thin social safety net has made the yemenis status insecure , he added
kim seong-in , who led support for yemenis in jeju for the refugee rights network , said it was the first time that such substantial public antipathy has emerged in south korea over the refugee issue
their hopes were dashed when south korea quickly blocked them from leaving the island , then dropped jejus visa-free status for yemenis
most of the refugees are men , but some are families with children
