beijing secretary of state mike pompeo got an earful from senior chinese officials during a five-hour visit to beijing on monday , effectively becoming the whipping boy in the increasingly acrimonious relationship between the two governments
pompeo is the most senior official to meet with his chinese counterparts since president trump accused beijing of interfering in novembers midterm elections , and vice president pence gave a vitriolic speech charging beijing with seeking to undermine u.s. interests across the globe
he felt the full force of the dispute during meetings with foreign minister wang yi and yang jiechi , a politburo member who has long dealt with bilateral relations
a stern-faced wang told his american counterpart
itself against anything the united states might do
he did , however , strike a slightly more conciliatory tone , urging the united states to expand cooperation and meet china halfway.
the secretary of state responded by saying that washington and beijing were stuck in a fundamental disagreement that he hoped they could make some progress on resolving
he lamented beijings recent decision not to attend the strategic dialogue between the two countries defense secretaries planned for the middle of this month , saying that the forum is an important opportunity for discussion
secretary of state pompeo reassures japan on the way to meet kim in north korea
it appeared that president xi jinping , who met pompeo during the americans visit in june , decided to snub him this time
there previously had been slots in the schedule for three meetings , but pompeo had only two
separately , it emerged that xi would soon make his first visit as president to north korea
he will visit soon , south korean president moon jae-in told a cabinet meeting monday
pompeo tried to focus on north koreas denuclearization during his meetings monday , an issue china and the united states generally agree on , even if they differ on how to get there
two of the five people on the american side of the meeting table dealt with north korea new special representative for north korea stephen e. biegun and national security council adviser allison hooker
the two sides agreed to set up working-level negotiating teams to finalize the date and time for a second summit between trump and kim , the secretary of state said before departing seoul for beijing
pompeo told reporters in south korea , the third stop on his trip
the korean central news agency ( kcna ) reported that kim had warmly welcomed pompeo in pyongyang and spoke highly of him.
during pompeos meeting in pyongyang , kim also invited inspectors to visit the punggye-ri nuclear test site to confirm that it has been irreversibly dismantled , the state department said
the secretary of state also confirmed that inspectors would be invited to a separate missile test site at tongchang-ri but declined to comment on which organization might be allowed into either site
but for all the new momentum on dealing with north korea , it was the bilateral relationship that dominated the discussions in beijing on monday
the global times , a state-run newspaper that often reflects the thinking of the communist party , linked the u.s. actions to a broader push to contain china and stem its rise
pence says china is trying to undermine trump because it wants a different american president
that trade war has now overflowed into other areas
the supposedly autonomous chinese territory of hong kong last month declined a scheduled port visit by a u.s. navy ship , and a chinese admiral canceled a planned visit to the united states
just last week , china pulled out of the planned top-level defense meeting
meanwhile , trump has accused beijing of interfering in the upcoming midterms by running a four-page editorial-style supplement in the des moines register , trying to tap into iowa farmers frustration over the tariffs
china hit back angrily , implying that it is the united states that has a track record of interfering in other countries business
then in a sharply critical speech last week , vice president pence issued a broad indictment of the methods behind chinas rise to becoming a major economic power , asserting that beijing has sought to undermine u.s. interests across the globe
ahead of the midterm elections , he said
the speech further inflamed tensions
