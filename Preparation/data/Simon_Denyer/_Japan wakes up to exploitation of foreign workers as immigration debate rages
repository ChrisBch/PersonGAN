gifu , japan twenty-seven-year-old war nu left her village in central myanmar at the end of last year bound for japan
she ended up simply packing garments into cardboard boxes from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. or midnight , six or even seven days a week
the basic pay , the equivalent of just $ 530 a month , was half what she had been promised , while her boss didnt stop shouting at her
war nu had come to japan under its technical intern training program or titp , a long-established program designed to ease the countrys chronic labor shortage while supposedly aiding countries in the region
as its name implies , it is designed to offer workers , mainly asians , training for three to five years before sending them home
in practice , it often amounts to forced labor , according to the u.s. state department
faced with a declining and rapidly aging population , japanese prime minister shinzo abe this month submitted a draft law to parliament that would let in up to 345,000 semiskilled foreign workers in the next five years
the move has sparked an intense debate both in parliament and the media , with the countrys weak and disorganized opposition parties enjoying a rare moment in the spotlight as they blast abes plans as vague and ill-prepared
in particular , many critics say abe first needs to clean up the mess that is the intern training program , before opening the doors to hundreds of thousands of additional foreign workers
aging japan needs new blood
but a plan to allow more foreign workers sparks concerns
as the debate rages , japanese media has awakened to the problems inherent in the titp , with headlines and stories in recent weeks about forced labor , hellish conditions , sexual harassment and workers being treated like slaves.
japans federation of bar associations last month issued a report calling for the entire trainee system to be abolished.
in practice , we think it is hardly about giving training , said lawyer masashi ichikawa
the main problem , lawyers say , is that workers are not allowed to change employers as a condition of their visa if they dare complain , they face losing their jobs and being deported
in its annual report on human trafficking , the state department says this often amounts to forced labor and that workers pay agents thousands of dollars to land jobs in japan , only to find themselves trapped in terrible situations
today , around 270,000 foreigners , many from vietnam , china , the philippines and indonesia , work in japan under the titp program
the number of workers rose 20 percent between 2016 and 2017
some work in agriculture picking strawberries in ibaraki and lettuce in nagano , for example while others work in manufacturing or construction
gifu , a city in central japan , is a center for the textiles industry , which increasingly relies on cheap foreign labor to remain competitive
working at a company called king style , war nu said she was treated more like a slave than a trainee by her boss
she and four other women shared two rooms above the factory , with barely enough time to eat and sleep.
it was inhumane , she said
the washington post interviewed eight other women in gifu who told similar stories of employers who paid less than they had promised , made them work longer hours than they expected and often gave them no training
both the state department and human rights watch say workers often borrow large sums of money to land jobs , but end up working long hours at below the minimum wage
many work in dangerous or unhygienic conditions and some face heavy fines if they fail to stay for the duration of their contracts
human rights watch said
such is the abuse inherent in the system that many workers abscond around 7,000 effectively vanished last year , and 4,300 more fled their jobs in the first six months of this year , many ending up underground as undocumented workers
realizing the scheme was giving the country a bad name , japan revised the trainee law in 2017 to strengthen oversight of companies that may be breaking the rules , and established a new organization for technical intern training to supervise the scheme
even before the law took effect , an investigation by the labor ministry in 2017 found that employers were breaking the rules at more than 4,000 locations more than 70 percent of those investigated through long hours , inadequate safety standards or low pay
kenichi tatezaki , an otit spokesman , said that in the future companies found breaking the rules could face having their permission to employ foreign workers withdrawn
so far , just one company has had permits withdrawn , but he said other investigations are underway
nevertheless , activists say little has changed at the ground level
japanese companies dont get penalized , said myint swe , the president of the federation of workers unions of the burmese citizen.
experts say the program simply reinforces stereotypes of foreigners as cheap labor rather than members of society and of absconders as criminals rather than victims of forced labor
such stereotypes are often played up in the media and a controversial television show dramatizing the work of immigration officers called at the moment of deportation.
the program is also fundamentally dishonest , experts say , meant to lure foreigners under false pretenses as a source of cheap labor while offering little in return
as a result , it was developing a bad reputation in other asian countries
as china , taiwan and south korea also face aging populations , they too will need more and more foreign workers in the years ahead
japans government knows it has to be more competitive if it wants to attract the best foreign workers , which is why abe has finally decided to ease restrictions and introduce new visas for semiskilled workers
said yoshihito kawakami , a lawyer who defends exploited workers
takeyuki hara , a lawyer at the olympia law firm representing king style , said the company acknowledged there had been violations of labor standards in the form of unpaid wages
it had been in talks with the burmese labor union , he said
but myint swe said the problems run far deeper than one company
