tokyo the offer by north korean leader kim jong un came with a caveat
he would permanently dismantle his countrys main nuclear site , but only if only if the united states makes concessions first
president trump called the developments part of tremendous progress in outreach to kims regime yet made no new commitments
kims announcement did appear , however , to give a boost to diplomatic overtures
secretary of state mike pompeo said the united states was prepared to engage immediately with north korea to move dialogue ahead
pompeo also plans to meet the norths foreign minister , ri yong ho , in new york next week during the united nations general assembly
kims proposal wednesday came after talks with south korean president moon jae-in in pyongyang seeking to push forward the two countries peace process and advance dialogue with the united states
standing side by side after their second day of talks , kim and moon declared that they had taken a major step toward an era of peace and prosperity on the korean peninsula
kim pledged to visit the south korean capital , seoul , in what would be a first for a north korean leader
he also said he would allow in external inspectors to verify that a key missile test site has been disabled
later , moon , who has fervently pursued engagement with the north , made history by addressing an audience of 150,000 people at a performance of the mass games , north koreas synchronized gymnastics and dance show
he told the audience in the huge may day stadium.
we must live together as one people.
the talks were supposed to enhance cooperation between the two koreas , as well as pave the way for a second summit between kim and trump later this year
experts said it was far from clear that kim had made concessions that would make a summit an attractive proposition for the u.s. administration , but trump himself reacted positively , saying on twitter that the news was very exciting.
he told reporters at the white house on wednesday morning
he noted with apparent approval that the latest inter-korean summit included a proposal for a potential joint north korean-south korean bid to host the 2032 olympic games , adding , we have a lot of very good things going.
trump said nothing about a potential second summit with kim , with whom he met in singapore in june
trump is expected to meet with moon on monday in new york , when both attend the annual united nations general assembly
moon is expected to use the meeting to urge further u.s.-north korean engagement
in pyongyang , kim focused on relations with south korea
the two koreas are still technically at war 65 years after an armistice ended the korean war
talks between the united states and north korea have reached an impasse over who should make the next move
washington wants pyongyang to take a meaningful step toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program
north korea , however , is pushing for the united states to declare the 1950-1953 korean war formally over and claims trump made a promise to that effect in singapore
members of trumps own administration are known to be more wary about north koreas intentions
tweeted sen. lindsey o. graham ( r-s.c. )
kim pledges to visit seoul but few details on denuclearization
in a joint statement with south korea , north korea pledged to permanently dismantle a missile engine test site and launchpad at tongchang-ri in the presence of experts from related countries.
that is a site it had already promised to close , although allowing foreign inspectors into the country would be a step forward
that are based on trumps agreement with kim at their june summit
but there was not enough in terms of new , concrete promises to satisfy many experts
senior trump administration officials want north korea to begin by declaring its nuclear and missile sites , rather than making piecemeal , unilateral concessions
experts also think north korea has continued to build nuclear weapons this year
said melissa hanham , a senior research associate at the middlebury institute of international studies at monterey
hanham said north korea made similar offers during previous rounds of negotiations , but the steps it ultimately took demolishing a cooling tower at yongbyon in 2008 , for example were easily reversed
but others took a more positive view
john delury , a professor at seouls yonsei university , argued that the two men succeeded in keeping negotiations moving forward in a process that was always going to be gradual
the leaders agreed to set up another buffer zone in the yellow sea where they would suspend maritime drills and the firing of guns , as well as a no-fly zone in border areas to prevent accidental plane clashes
