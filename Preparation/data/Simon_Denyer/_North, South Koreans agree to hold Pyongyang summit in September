tokyo the leaders of north and south korea will hold a summit in september , their governments announced monday , as their peace process moves steadily forward despite signs of a growing impasse between washington and pyongyang
the summit will take place in pyongyang
it will be the third between south korean president moon jae-in and north korean leader kim jong un this year and only the third time that a south korean leader has traveled to the north korean capital for such a meeting
the trump administration appears to have run into rougher waters in its attempts in recent weeks to persuade north korea to denuclearize , but the two koreas appear to be making more progress in their gradual rapprochement
the announcement came after north and south korean government officials held talks on the northern side of the border village of panmunjom
afterward , he said a date has been fixed but not announced , to keep reporters wondering.
u.s. officials have privately expressed irritation at the breakneck pace of the rapprochement between the north and south amid stalled denuclearization talks with washington
the united states is pushing nations to tighten the enforcement of existing u.n. sanctions against north korea , but the opening of dialogue between president trump and kim at a summit in june effectively ended pyongyangs international isolation
that is not to say that the peace process across the divided korean peninsula is smooth sailing
on sunday , a north korean propaganda website blamed seouls blind obedience to u.s.-led sanctions for what it called the failure to make progress since moon and kim met on the border in a blaze of publicity in april
in private , trump vents frustration over lack of progress on north korea
but if that suggested differing priorities , the opening statements as the talks got underway monday were all about friendship and rapprochement
by contrast , secretary of state mike pompeo seemed to come away empty-handed from a trip to pyongyang after trump and kims meeting in singapore in june , with north korea blaming what it called the gangster-like mind-set of the united states
last week , north koreas foreign ministry also criticized high-level officials within the u.s. administration for insisting that the north give up its nuclear weapons before sanctions are eased and for making desperate attempts at intensifying the international sanctions and pressure.
those officials , the foreign ministry said , are going against the intention of president trump to advance relations between the two countries
while the declaration that followed trumps meeting with kim was widely criticized as being too vague , the panmunjom declaration reached between moon and kim was much more detailed , delury said
the two sides also have more experience talking to each other from previous peace processes
delury said that was not a criticism of trump and his team but just to highlight the different problems and contexts of the two parallel peace processes
but kim eui-keum , a spokesman for seouls presidential blue house , told reporters that early september seems a bit difficult.
before the talks , south korean media reported that moon may also urge kim to attend the united nations general assembly in new york in late september
