tokyo president trump may have fallen in love with his north korean counterpart , kim jong un , but pyongyang wants washington to prove its affection by lifting sanctions
after a summit between the leaders of the two koreas last month , kim said he was prepared to permanently dismantle his countrys main nuclear site , but only if the united states took corresponding steps to build trust
at the time , it appeared that meant a declaration to formally end the 1950-53 korean war , as a signal that hostilities between the two countries were over
but during the past few days , pyongyang has signaled that it may want more than that to move forward
north korea refers to itself as the democratic peoples republic of korea ( dprk )
by contrast , the yongbyon facility is a core part of the countrys nuclear program , kcna argued
it is the site of the countrys only nuclear reactor , producing plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons , but also is believed to house a separate uranium enrichment facility
said woo jung-yeop , a researcher at south koreas sejong institute
north korean foreign minister ri yong ho delivered a similarly combative message at the u.n. general assembly on saturday
rodong sinmun , the official newspaper of the workers party of korea , underlined the point in an editorial sunday
the united states argues that the sanctions should remain in place until north korea has fully and verifiably denuclearized
a massive spike in oil smuggling eases the economic pressure on north korea
experts say pyongyang is not ready to offer a comprehensive list of its nuclear facilities , believing this would either be disbelieved or give the united states a list of future military targets
instead , it wants to take things at its own pace , offering up yongbyon as part of a phased process in which both sides take steps to build trust
experts differ about north koreas sincerity some , like narang , say it has no real interest in disarmament and is just milking the process for whatever benefits it can get
others say pyongyang may be prepared to reduce but not eliminate its nuclear stockpile and missile capability , in return for economic benefits and security guarantees from washington
the south korean government and some experts go further , arguing that kim may be prepared to completely denuclearize under the right circumstances
even some skeptics , though , acknowledge that the current dialogue has brought rewards in terms of an end to nuclear and missile testing and reduced tensions
kim wants new summit with trump soon to continue denuclearization
south koreas presidential blue house has been arguing for an end-of-war declaration and predicts that such a declaration could come after trump and kim meet again
at a campaign rally saturday , trump said he and kim fell in love , adding , he wrote me beautiful letters.
pompeo , on his fifth visit to pyongyang this year , is expected to meet kim on sunday , which experts said would be a positive sign
he begins his trip in tokyo and will also visit seoul and beijing
state department spokeswoman heather nauert said tuesday
