taipei , taiwan on the face of it , hes an unlikely champion for asian democracy
a longhaired rocker with a gothic taste in myths and legends , he sings in a rasping scream , backed by fast-paced riffs and frenzied drumming , his face decorated in menacing black paint , his arms and chest emblazoned with tattoos
but freddy lim has an alter ego a transformation as complete as clark kents into superman
for these days , he is one of the rising stars of taiwanese politics , a new progressive breed of politician breathing new life into this small islands democracy in the menacing shadow of china
today , at age 42 , he aims to make taiwan a model for the rest of asia , proof that democracy , even in this diplomatically isolated outpost , can still work
chthonic prefers to call it orient metal.
the bands name , pronounced thonic , comes from a greek word for the underworld , and lims songs are often inspired by taiwanese folklore and mythology
but there is politics , too , and anger at the corrupt elite who ruled taiwan under martial law from 1949 to 1987
in the video for supreme pain for the tyrant , those martial-law rulers enjoy a debauched party with german nazis until it is violently broken up by members of the band and the uniformed dictators are killed
lim named himself after freddy krueger , the razor-wielding serial killer from a nightmare on elm street.
but beneath the fierce stage persona , he has never been your typical rock star
lim and his fellow band members barely drink , and he has been a human rights activist for two decades , even serving for four years as the youngest chair of amnesty internationals taiwan section
his new power party ( npp ) grew out of taiwans 2014 sunflower student movement , which occupied parliament to protest closer economic ties with mainland china
from nowhere , the npp won five parliamentary seats in taiwans 2016 elections , with lim triumphing in a taipei district against a well-funded candidate from the then-ruling kuomintang , whose main line of attack seemed to be mocking lims long hair
j. michael cole , a taipei-based analyst , said much of lims appeal lay in his status as an outsider who was not tainted by a political establishment seen by many young people as dysfunctional and anti-democratic
lim has been an outspoken advocate for taiwans independence from china , and for tibetans right to self-determination , often waving a tibetan flag at his concerts and proudly displaying a photo of the dalai lama near one of david bowie in his office
he has also forged links with democratic activists all over asia at a time when democracy and free speech are under siege from thailand to the philippines , from malaysia to hong kong , vietnam and cambodia
he says the people of taiwan have a special responsibility not to lose hope in the face of constant chinese pressure
they are working toward a law that would make taiwan the first place in asia to legalize same-sex marriage , and another to allow refugees , including tibetans , the right to seek permanent residency
on the question of formally declaring independence from china something that beijing says it would view as an act of war lim the politician is a little more circumspect than lim the activist rocker
more important , he says , is to build a better taiwan
lim the politician is different in other ways from lim the rock star
he is learning , he says , not just to express his emotions , but also to listen to others
and he is growing up after his wife , chthonic bassist doris yeh , gave birth to their first child , a girl , last year
he also had to cope with the deaths of his father and a close friend
lim hasnt given up music a long-delayed new album is due this year , but he has played only two live shows since entering parliament
lim the singer has often toured the united states , once as part of ozzfest , the festival organized by former black sabbath frontman ozzy osbourne
lim the politician was part of the taiwanese delegation at president trumps inauguration last year
thats very important , and its my job as a politician.
