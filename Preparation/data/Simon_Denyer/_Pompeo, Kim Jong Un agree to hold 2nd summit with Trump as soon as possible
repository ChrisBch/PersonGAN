tokyo secretary of state mike pompeo said he had productive talks with north korean leader kim jong un in pyongyang on sunday , with the pair reportedly agreeing to hold a summit between kim and president trump as soon as possible
pompeo and kim met for about two hours and then had a 90-minute lunch together
south korea later said the two men agreed to a second kim-trump summit at the earliest possible date.
its good to see you again , pompeo told kim as the two men shook hands for the cameras before lunch
the secretary of state then put his hand on kims shoulder , and the pair smiled
pompeo said he had a great visit and a very successful morning , adding that trump sent his regards
both men spoke through interpreters
the secretary of states previous trip to north korea , in july , did not go so well
he came away from it saying the two sides had made progress , only for north korea to denounce him for making gangster-like demands and raising cancerous issues
on that occasion , he did not meet with kim
pompeo then planned to return in late august , only for trump to cancel the trip at the last minute as it became apparent that the two sides remained far apart on their approach to the negotiations
but a summit of the leaders of north and south korea last month has helped to rekindle the peace process , as has the apparent desire of both kim and trump to meet again
later sunday , pompeo flew to seoul , where he met with south korean president moon jae-in
he said in seoul that he had had a good , productive conversation with kim
during his private meeting with moon , pompeo said he and kim had agreed to arrange the second u.s.-north korea summit at the earliest possible date , according to a statement issued by moons chief press secretary , yoon young-chan
yoon said the two sides would form working-level negotiating teams to discuss the specific date and location for the summit , as well as north koreas denuclearization process
during pompeos meeting in pyongyang , kim invited inspectors to visit the punggye-ri nuclear test site to confirm that it has been irreversibly dismantled , a state department spokeswoman , heather nauert , said in a statement
north korea had committed to this previously but has been resistant to allowing international inspectors to visit sites it has claimed have been dismantled
said adam mount , a senior fellow at the federation of american scientists
nauerts statement made no mention of north koreas commitment to dismantle the important yongbyon nuclear facility , a potentially troubling sign for u.s. negotiators
at the heart of the impasse has been two fundamentally different approaches to denuclearization
pompeo has insisted that sanctions on north korea should remain in place until the country completely dismantles its nuclear program
the governments of both north and south korea , however , say that is unrealistic
instead , they want both sides to take a phased approach , in which pyongyang is rewarded as it takes gradual steps to roll back its nuclear program
that is not how pyongyang sees things , nor is it the approach being advocated for by seoul
after the summit between the leaders of the two koreas last month , kim said he was prepared to permanently dismantle his countrys main nuclear site at yongbyon , but only if the united states took corresponding steps to build trust
north korea has been asking for the united states to declare the 1950-1953 korean war formally over , as a way to end hostile relations between the two countries
the war concluded with an armistice but no peace treaty
in the past few days , north korea has also renewed its demands for sanctions to be eased
north korean foreign minister ri yong ho told the u.n. general assembly late last month that coercive sanctions were lethal to trust-building between the two nations and that without trust , there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
