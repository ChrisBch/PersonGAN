paris french finance minister bruno le maire called tuesday for an interim governance structure to be put in place at renault while the financial dealings of auto executive carlos ghosn are investigated
ghosn was arrested monday in japan , where he serves as the chairman of nissan
the japanese automaker announced that ghosn would be dismissed because of significant acts of misconduct that allegedly included underreporting his salary and using company assets for personal benefit
ghosn , a brazilian-born french citizen of lebanese descent , also serves as chairman of mitsubishi motors and chairman and chief executive of renault
ghosn was instrumental in helping forge an alliance among the three companies
the french government has a 15 percent stake in renault , and the news from japan seemed to catch paris off guard
nissan said ghosns arrest stemmed from a whistleblowers report , but questions swirled about whether he was the victim of political maneuverings within nissan or had simply created too many enemies by getting too big for his own boots
nissan says chairman carlos ghosn has been arrested over alleged financial misconduct
while renaults most senior executives were reported to have pledged their full support to ghosn , and lebanons government said it stood by him , the french government was effectively forced to acknowledge that ghosn could not continue as head of renault for now
said le maire , speaking tuesday morning on france info television
for the moment , le maire said , the french government would not be demanding ghosns departure from renaults board because we have no proof that he engaged in financial wrongdoing in france
industry watchdogs are waiting for news from renault on a possible interim leadership change
a renault spokesman said the companys board was to meet tuesday evening in paris
describing it in a joint statement as one of the greatest examples of franco-japanese industrial cooperation
the news of ghosns arrest sparked a defensive reaction in lebanon , where his heritage is a source of pride
lebanese foreign minister gebran bassil said in a statement that he has instructed the lebanese ambassador in tokyo to follow the case and ensure that ghosn gets fair treatment , according to the associated press
in japan , ghosn had been one of the most admired and well-paid executives
his sudden fall from grace dominated headlines , with details of the accusations against him leaking to the media
national broadcaster nhk said nissan had paid huge sums to buy and maintain luxury residences for ghosn in beirut , paris , amsterdam and rio de janeiro that were not for legitimate business reasons
the purchases were not declared in stock market filings , while ghosn was underpaying or not paying rent , nhk alleged , citing unidentified sources
the nikkei newspaper , again citing anonymous sources , alleged that nearly $ 18 million had been funneled through a dutch subsidiary of nissan to purchase a condominium on rios copacabana strip and a luxury home in beirut
nhk also alleged that ghosn , who was in charge of paying nissans top 13 executives , had secretly siphoned off some of that money for himself
public prosecutors have confirmed that ghosn was arrested on suspicion of failing to declare around $ 44 million in income on nissans official securities reports submitted over five years starting from 2011
nissan representative director greg kelly also has been arrested
ghosn had won many admirers during his long career as one of the worlds leading auto executives
his ruthless cost-cutting and vision to promote electric vehicles and low-cost vehicles had helped rescue both renault and nissan
his high salary and that same ruthlessness had also attracted many critics
experts said one reason that he may have underreported his compensation may have been to avoid more criticism the french government had long opposed his salary package , and renaults shareholders had voted down his pay in 2016 , although the vote was nonbinding
only by agreeing to a pay cut did ghosn get shareholders approval at an annual meeting in paris in june
under pressure from the french government , ghosn had been exploring an even closer tie-up between renault and nissan , something that had raised hackles in the japanese company
on monday , saikawa said structural issues , including the fact that 43 percent of nissan is held by renault and that ghosn held key roles in both companies , was one of the factors or drivers for the governance problems
nevertheless , auto industry experts say the alliance has proved so valuable for both companies that it is unlikely to unravel
meanwhile , in japan , there were questions about whether ghosn was being treated in the same way that a japanese executive might be treated in similar circumstances
nobuo gohara , the head of a law firm specializing in compliance , said he had not heard of a previous case in which a false statement regarding directors compensation in a securities report had resulted in such a punishment
gohara wrote in a blog post
nissan shares fell more than 5 percent in tokyo trading tuesday
its extremely regrettable , japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga told reporters.
we will watch developments closely.
