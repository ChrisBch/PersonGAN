tokyo japans whaling operations have suffered a big setback after the scientific hunt for sei whales in the northern pacific was effectively declared illegal by an international body that regulates trade in endangered species
the standing committee of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ) found tuesday that japan had broken the rules by commercially selling thousands of tons of meat from endangered sei whales
sei whales are the ninth-largest living animal on the planet , usually growing to between 45 and 60 feet in length and weighing 20 tons
they also are among the fastest whales , possessing the ability to swim up to 35 mph
they are found in almost every ocean and sea in the world but were hunted almost to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries
japan has killed more than 1,500 sei whales in 16 years , supposedly in the name of scientific research
it then sells the meat openly in the country , saying it uses the proceeds to fund further research , even though the international whaling commission agreed to a global moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982
but the cites standing committee overwhelmingly ruled that japan had broken its rules by taking the whale meat from international waters , effectively constituting illegal trade across international boundaries
said erica jayne lyman , a professor in the international environmental law project at lewis and clark law school in portland , ore
japan has until feb. 1 , 2019 , to remedy its noncompliance and report back to cites
they are thought to number in the tens of thousands globally , but there is no accurate count
the species latin name is balaenoptera borealis , which means northern winged whale
japans bid to resume commercial whaling sets stage for fierce debate
the decision is the latest setback for japans whaling industry
last month , a japanese proposal to reintroduce sustainable commercial whaling of four species was rejected by a vote of 42 to 27 at an international whaling commission meeting in brazil
in march 2014 , the international court of justice ruled that japans antarctic hunt had no scientific basis
in a recent report , the environmental investigation agency ( eia ) and the animal welfare institute said japan , norway and iceland had killed 38,539 whales since the moratorium took effect , with more than 22,000 killed by japanese boats alone
filmmaker tries to bridge cultural divide between japan , u.s. over whale , dolphin hunting
wildlife groups say japans whale hunt for ostensible research purposes is a thinly veiled attempt to keep the commercial whaling industry alive , ensuring boats , skills and a market for whale meat are maintained
danielle grabiel , senior wildlife policy analyst for the eias u.s. office , called the decision a big deal and a referendum on japans whaling programs
sue fisher , a consultant with the animal welfare institute , said that if japan did not end the commercial trade in sei whales , cites could impose sanctions on trade with japan involving all cites-managed species , including tropical timber and reptile skins
