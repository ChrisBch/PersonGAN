beijing china is sending a senior diplomat to visit north korea as an envoy of president xi jinping , the foreign ministry said wednesday , reopening a channel of dialogue with the isolated regime
song tao , who heads the communist party 's external affairs department , will head to pyongyang on friday to inform the north korean government about beijing 's recently concluded communist party congress , the state-run xinhua news agency said
the announcement comes a week after president trump visited china and asked xi to work hard to rein in north korea 's nuclear weapons program
but the foreign ministry said this trip was not connected to trump 's visit
beijing routinely undertakes such trips to fellow communist states after key party meetings , and song has already visited vietnam and laos on similar missions
the main purpose of the visit is to report on the 19th party congress , said ministry spokesman geng shuang
he said it was traditional practice for china 's communist party to brief the korean workers party and parties from other socialist countries after such events
asked if the envoy would meet north korean leader kim jong un , geng said he was not aware of the detailed arrangements for the trip
trump-kim insults take a schoolyard turn
he implied that song would bring up north korea 's nuclear program
he will also exchange views on issues of common interest , such as relations between the two parties and the two countries , he told a news conference
the visit represents an important opportunity for beijing to reopen a channel of dialogue with the isolated regime , experts said , as relations between the countries have deteriorated significantly in recent years
china has an official special envoy to north korea , kong xuanyou , but he is not believed to have visited pyongyang since taking the job in august
his predecessor , wu dawei , last visited north korea in february 2016
song 's visit will be the first by a ministerial-level official since then-politburo standing committee member liu yunshan went to pyongyang and met kim in october 2015
xi is believed to be frustrated with north korea 's aggressive development and testing of its nuclear weapons and missiles , and he has imposed a relatively strict set of sanctions under u.s. pressure and in line with u.n. security council resolutions
trump speech strikes at heart of north korean regime
but china still dominates trade with north korea and is unwilling to cut off the regime 's economic lifeline , symbolized by a pipeline that supplies the crude oil keeping the country 's military and industry afloat
it does not want to see a fellow communist regime and long-standing ally toppled , but it equally does not want the current regime to turn hostile and threaten china with its nuclear weapons and missiles
they still want to balance and they want to maintain some channels , said paul haenle , director of the carnegie-tsinghua center in beijing
relations have really deteriorated , and the chinese recognize that
they do n't want relations to fall apart
haenle said the visit might include some sweet talk for pyongyang about working together
but he predicted that the chinese would also make their displeasure known
wang sheng , a north korea expert at jilin university in changchun , said communications between beijing and pyongyang improved after the party congress when kim sent xi a congratulatory message and xi sent his thanks in return
he said china could use the trip to persuade the north to return to the negotiation table as soon as possible
trump to south korean president do you have to reunify
while in beijing , trump said china can fix the north korea problem quickly and easily , and he urged xi to work on it very hard
after leaving china , he suggested that more action by beijing was coming
president xi of china has stated that he is upping the sanctions against noko
said he wants them to denuclearize
progress is being made , trump tweeted saturday
