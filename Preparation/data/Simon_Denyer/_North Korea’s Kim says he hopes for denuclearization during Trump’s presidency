tokyo north korean leader kim jong un told a team of south korean envoys that he continues to trust president trump and said he hoped to achieve the denuclearization of the korean peninsula while trump is in office , the chief envoy said thursday
trump responded on twitter by expressing his appreciation
the u.s. president tweeted.
thank you to chairman kim
we will get it done together
but there also was a reminder of the current impasse in negotiations
north korean media repeated the countrys demand that the united states make the next move by formally declaring an end to the korean war , which concluded in 1953 with an armistice but not a peace treaty
justice department prepares hacking charges on suspected north korean spy
the north insists trump promised such a declaration when he met kim in singapore in june
but it is a move that washington is reluctant to make , fearing that it could ultimately throw into question the continued presence of u.s. troops in south korea
the south korean envoys delivered a letter from president moon jae-in , as well as a message from trump , who spoke to moon by telephone earlier in the week
the two sides agreed that a planned summit between the leaders of both koreas would take place in pyongyang on sept. 18-20 , and they pledged to open a joint liaison office in the north before then
in wednesdays meeting , north koreas kim expressed frustration with skepticism in some parts of the international community about his commitment to denuclearize , according to chung eui-yong , south koreas director of national security and the leader of the team of envoys
the north korean leader also pointed to the dismantling of the punggye-ri nuclear test site and dongchang-ri missile launch facility as evidence of his commitment to end nuclear testing permanently , chung said
and he asked for a message to be delivered to trump
trump is blaming china for korea impasse , but fault may lie closer to home
that message will very probably contain an appeal for the united states to formally declare an end to the war , something north korea says is vital to building trust and ending decades of hostility
kim said such a declaration would not imply a withdrawal of u.s. troops or a weakening of the u.s.-south korean military alliance , chung added
chung told a news conference the day after his return
an end-of-war declaration is seen as only a first step toward a full peace treaty , which in theory would involve the denuclearization of the korean peninsula and normalization of diplomatic relations between pyongyang and washington , diplomats say
on thursday , north koreas rodong sinmun newspaper said the trump administration must discard its stubborn stance that the north must denuclearize first before the united states agrees to a peace treaty
it will discuss the implementation of a joint declaration reached by moon and kim when they met in the border village of panmunjom in april
harry kazianis , director of defense studies at the center for the national interest in washington , said he felt the envoys visit could not have gone any better
