beijing china responded to the threat of new tariffs from the united states by vowing tuesday to further open its own markets to foreign trade and investment , while warning that a trade war between the two nations would hurt both sides
president trump is preparing to impose a package of $ 60 billion in annual tariffs against chinese products , a move that he says will punish china for intellectual property theft and create more u.s. jobs , administration officials say
he is determined to bring down the u.s. trade deficit with china , which reached $ 375 billion last year
but chinas premier , li keqiang , said the issue should be solved through dialogue and negotiation
china says that trade benefits both countries , but li acknowledged u.s. concerns
li reiterated a pledge made at the opening of the parliamentary session two weeks ago to further open chinas markets to foreign companies , something he said was in beijings interests
and he also vowed stronger protection for foreign companies intellectual property
the u.s. business community here says that china does not treat foreign companies fairly and has failed to follow through in recent years on pledges to open its doors more widely
despite chinas recent attempt to portray itself as a defender of free trade , the reality is that u.s. markets remain far more open than chinese ones , diplomats and experts say
the american chamber of commerce in china reacted somewhat warily , saying it was pleased to hear lis pledges to grant greater market access and better protect intellectual property
but it added that it would have to wait and see what revisions are put in place by china and how effective they will be
it also gave qualified support to trumps tough stance
we believe these steps will bring opportunities for american companies , too , he said , while also reiterating a long-standing chinese request for the united states to ease restrictions on high-tech exports to china
li said there would be no mandatory requirements for technology transfer , a key complaint from foreign investors in the past
chinas aim , he said , is that both chinese and foreign companies can compete on level terms , but he also warned that further opening up will naturally be a step-by-step process.
he also suggested that china would not make unilateral concessions
otherwise it will just keep spinning at the same place.
last week , a coalition of u.s. business and trade lobby groups urged trump not to impose tariffs on china , warning it would be particularly harmful to the u.s. economy and consumers
but the afl-cio union federation says tariffs are sometimes necessary to counter unfair trade practices , especially if they put american workers at a disadvantage
