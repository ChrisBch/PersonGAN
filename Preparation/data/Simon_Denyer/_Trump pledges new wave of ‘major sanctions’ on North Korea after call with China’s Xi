beijing president trump pledged wednesday that additional major sanctions would be imposed on north korea after pyongyang 's latest intercontinental missile test
trump 's statement followed a telephone conversation with chinese president xi jinping , whose country is an economic lifeline for north korea
beijing 's backing is needed for any additional economic pressures on the regime of kim jong un , and it was unclear how far china could go in applying new sanctions
just spoke to president xi jinping of china concerning the latest provocative actions of north korea , trump tweeted
additional major sanctions will be imposed on north korea today
this situation will be handled
in washington , secretary of state rex tillerson said a range of additional u.s. sanctions were being considered
we have a long list of additional , potential sanctions , some of which involve
financial institutions , he said when asked about possible measures as he posed for photos with the visiting bahraini crown prince
and the treasury department will be announcing those when they 're ready to roll out
on wednesday , north korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile , its third and most advanced yet , with experts calculating that the u.s. capital is now technically within north korean reach
could north koreas missile test lead to talks
north korea said the hwasong-15 could be armed with a super-large heavy nuclear warhead and is capable of striking the entire u.s. mainland
in a government statement , it said kim declared with pride that the country has achieved its goal of becoming a rocket power
in a statement , the white house said trump underscored the determination of the united states to defend ourselves and our allies from the growing threat posed by the north korean regime in his call with xi
president trump emphasized the need for china to use all available levers to convince north korea to end its provocations and return to the path of denuclearization , said the statement
according to china 's state news agency xinhua , xi told trump that denuclearization of the korean peninsula is china 's unswerving goal and china is ready to join the u.s. in pushing the nuclear issue toward a peaceful settlement
twenty-five million reasons the u.s. hasnt struck north korea
after trump visited china last month , he boasted of a promise from xi to use his great economic influence over the north korean regime to make it abandon its nuclear missile program
that promise is now being put to the test
earlier on wednesday , china 's foreign ministry expressed its grave concern and opposition to the launch by north korea , which it refers to by its official name , the democratic people 's republic of korea , or dprk
north korea could now almost certainly strike london or berlin
why isnt europe more worried
we strongly urge the dprk side to abide by the relevant u.n. security council resolutions and halt any moves that could aggravate the situation on the korean peninsula , foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a regular news conference
but the question remains how far is china prepared to push its neighbor and fellow communist regime , at the behest of the united states and in the quest for a denuclearized korean peninsula
before the phone call between trump and xi , chinese experts were skeptical that beijing would go much further
if china imposes heavier sanctions , that would be symbolic at best i think , said song xiaojun , who used to run a government-linked military magazine
china has a bottom line 'do n't affect the life of the north korean people , on humanitarian principles
it gives them things like oil and food to allow people there to survive
the latest missile test may not have come as a surprise in beijing , since north korea had already made it clear it was continuing with its missile test program , said zhao tong , a nuclear policy expert at the carnegie-tsinghua center here
but it will still underline beijing 's discomfort with its truculent neighbor and lead inevitably to further economic pressure , he said
the degree of further economic sanctions depends on north korea 's next step
for example will they launch a complete icbm or take a more extreme step such as a nuclear test in the pacific ocean or atmosphere
but the trend toward increasing the economic sanctions is going to continue
yet there are also signs that china may be tiring of the american approach of maximum pressure
in an editorial in its chinese-language edition issued wednesday , the nationalist global times newspaper said the test was a sign that past u.s. policy toward north korea had failed and that the approach tried under trump had also been unsuccessful
and the state-run china daily newspaper also issued an editorial that tried to shift the blame onto trump for last week declaring north korea a state-sponsor of terrorism , at a time when pyongyang had briefly paused its missile testing program
there is a severe trust deficit among the relevant parties that is being exacerbated by the actions of washington and pyongyang
that attempt to blame washington rather than pyongyang does not get much traction in the west , but it does reveal a mind-set among sections of the communist party
the united states has demanded that the security council hold an emergency meeting , but the leverage exerted by the international community on north korea is almost exhausted , the global times wrote
now pyongyang is extremely confident , for condemnation by the u.n. security council and possible new sanction measures are equal to a few more grains of dust on its body , or a few more drops of rain
yet there is no doubt that patience with pyongyang is also in short supply in china right now
lu chao , a korea expert at the liaoning academy of social sciences in shenyang , called the latest test a a very dangerous provocation
it will almost certainly provoke a u.s. reaction which will further destabilize the situation on the peninsula , he said , adding that north korea was going on its own
it 's certain that , on issues regarding nuclear and missile tests , china opposes them but does n't have much influence on north korea , he said
on the situation in the korean peninsula , china and north korea lack effective communication
there was a hint of an opening between beijing and pyongyang last month , experts say
north korea refrained from conducting any missile tests during an important communist party congress in november at which xi was granted another five years in power
a few days later , xi sent a senior envoy , song tao , to brief the regime in pyongyang about the party congress although the envoy did not meet north korean leader kim
lu said the lack of a meeting might have been a sign that kim was preparing to launch another missile
if he met with song tao and then launched the missile , it would have infuriated china more , he said
a few days before that announcement , state-owned air china also suspended flights between beijing and pyongyang , citing a lack of demand
