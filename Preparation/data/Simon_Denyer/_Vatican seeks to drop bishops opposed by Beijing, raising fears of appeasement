but a deal is not imminent , experts said , nor would it be universally welcomed within the catholic church
the latest developments have prompted one retired cardinal to make an emotional appeal to the pope on the bishops behalf
beijing broke off diplomatic relations with the vatican in 1951 , not long after the communist party came to power
since then , two parallel catholic churches have grown up in china the chinese catholic patriotic association ( ccpa ) run by state-appointed bishops and an underground church with many bishops appointed by the vatican
the vatican is eager to bring the entire chinese catholic community of about 10 million to 12 million people back into the fold , and talks have been underway since 2014
yet the question of whether the chinese state or the holy see has ultimate authority over the appointment of bishops has been a major sticking point
jesus wont save you president xi jinping will , chinese christians told
in recent weeks , there were signs of a breakthrough , as first reported by the catholic website asianews.it
last month , a delegation from the vatican traveled to china and met bishop peter zhuang jianjian , 88 , who presides over the church in shantou in the southern province of guangdong
zhuang was in tears at this demand , the website reported
another vatican-appointed bishop , joseph guo xijin in eastern fujian province , was also asked to downgrade himself and become assistant to a ccpa bishop , vincent zhan silu , the website reported
on monday , retired hong kong cardinal joseph zen confirmed the account reported by asianews.it and said he had flown to rome to meet the pope on behalf of zhuang
he said that he was granted a private audience jan. 12 and that the pope promised to look into the matter
zen added that the pope had warned officials not to create another mindszenty case suggesting a certain degree of sympathy with the retired cardinal 's point of view
but the vatican denied that there was a difference of opinion between the pope and his negotiating team
it is therefore surprising and regrettable that the contrary is affirmed by people in the church , thus fostering confusion and controversy , the statement added
zen has become the most vocal opponent of rapprochement between the vatican and the communist party , and he reiterated those concerns in a blog post monday
is it not good to try to find mutual ground to bridge the decades-long divide between the vatican and china
but can there be anything really 'mutual with a totalitarian regime
either you surrender or you accept persecution , but remaining faithful to yourself
zen compared it to making a deal between saint joseph , husband of jesus mother , mary , and king herod , who in the bible ordered the execution of young male children
so , do i think that the vatican is selling out the catholic church in china
yes , definitely , if they go in the direction which is obvious from all what they are doing in recent years and months , zen wrote
but francesco sisci , a senior researcher at the center of european studies at the renmin university of china and a vatican affairs expert , said he does not think zen represents mainstream opinion within the catholic church
the state department classifies china as a country of particular concern for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom
human rights groups say the muslim uighur minority , tibetan buddhists and members of the falun gong spiritual movement often face more systematic problems than christians , although severe repression of unauthorized house churches has been reported
nevertheless , the number of practicing christians is rising rapidly in china and could total about 100 million people by some estimates
sisci said that thousands of catholic missionaries work in china , with the full knowledge of authorities , and that expulsions are extremely rare
nevertheless , he said it was a sensitive time for the vatican to make major concessions to china
the holy see is torn because of the papacy 's stand on moral issues , on social issues
so the china issue , which is extremely controversial , can become a fuse that can rip the church apart , he warned
but sisci took heart from an article in china 's state-run global times newspaper this week that appeared to acknowledge the vatican 's difficulties in reaching a deal
never before have they realized the internal difficulties of the holy see , he said , perhaps implying more flexibility from china
this in itself is a breakthrough
the vatican is one of the few states that maintains diplomatic relations with taiwan , and many people there fear it would be forced to break those ties if there is rapprochement with beijing
but sisci said this was premature , saying that the vatican was not seeking full diplomatic ties with beijing or anything that would damage taiwan 's interests
