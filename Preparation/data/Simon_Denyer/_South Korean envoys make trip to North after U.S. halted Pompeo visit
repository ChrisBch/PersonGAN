tokyo south korean delegates delivered a letter from their president to north korean leader kim jong un on wednesday in preparation for a planned summit they hope will maintain the momentum of dialogue on the divided peninsula
south korean president moon jae-in is due to visit kim in pyongyang from sept. 18 to 20 for the third meeting between the two leaders this year , officials announced thursday
the south korean team also seeks to establish a joint korean liaison office in the north , officials said
the office is a key part of outreach between the two koreas that began earlier this year and helped open the door for the history-making talks in june between kim and president trump
trump canceled a planned visit by secretary of state mike pompeo to pyongyang last month , citing a lack of progress in denuclearization by the north
moon , however , considers ongoing dialogue with the north to be the best way to build trust and persuade pyongyang to abandon or scale back its nuclear weapons program
earlier on wednesday , officials from the south korean presidential blue house released photos of kim meeting the visiting south korean envoys , with wide smiles all around
moon is playing a delicate balancing act , trying to improve relations with the north , while not getting too far ahead of washington as its parallel peace process with pyongyang is faltering
the blue house said in a statement after moon called trump
at the heart of the impasse between washington and pyongyang is a disagreement on which side should make the next move
it says trump expressed support for such an idea when he met kim in singapore
north , south koreans agree to hold pyongyang summit in september
senior u.s. officials are believed to be reluctant to take such a step unless they see concrete action from pyongyang in dismantling at least part of its nuclear arsenal
north korea wrote to pompeo last month , warning that the peace process was faltering and telling him not to come to pyongyang unless he was willing to bring further concessions , officials have said
before the latest setback , moon had spoken optimistically about his planned september summit with kim and promised that the pair would take an audacious step toward the signing of a peace treaty and the complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula
last month , he also expressed hope that groundbreaking ceremonies to establish road and rail links between the two koreas could take place before the end of the year , and he set out an ambitious vision of long-term economic integration between the neighbors
koh yu-hwan , a policy adviser at south koreas national security office and professor of north korean studies at dongguk university , said seoul could not simply sit on its hands amid the impasse between pyongyang and washington
