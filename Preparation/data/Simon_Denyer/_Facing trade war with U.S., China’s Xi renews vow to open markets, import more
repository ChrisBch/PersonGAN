speaking at an annual economic forum 40 years after china began what is known as the reform and opening up of its economy , xi pledged to begin a new phase of that process
the trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs on $ 150 billion in chinese imports over allegations of unfair trade practices
but his speech was more a reiteration of existing commitments than any major new initiatives , and experts said it was neither concrete enough in itself , nor far-reaching enough , to defuse the trade dispute with washington especially after years of broken promises
addressing several concerns raised by the u.s. administration and business community , xi promised significantly lower import tariffs for vehicles , an easing of restrictions on foreign investment in autos and financial services , and greater protection for intellectual property
only a few hours before , president trump had tweeted about chinas unfair 25 percent tariffs on car imports
jake parker at the u.s. china business council said xi addressed some key concerns but fell short of offering paradigm-shifting announcements on ending the joint venture and licensing requirements that give china leverage to force technology transfer in return for market access
the president added
the winners in trumps trade war
this indiana family
the same family
china made a similar promise to cut auto tariffs in november when trump visited beijing , and again at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , in january
u.s. officials have reacted with skepticism until now , saying it was time for action , not empty promises
nevertheless , the fact that xi made the commitment in a keynote speech at an important event , billed as chinas version of davos , gave the promise more weight
alicia garcia-herrero , chief asia pacific economist at the natixis investment banking firm in hong kong , said xis pledges were insufficient to resolve the trade dispute
and christopher balding , an associate professor of business and economics at the hsbc business school in shenzhen , said xis speech was largely a re-rerun of previous speeches and previous commitments.
balding said it would be hard to find a way out of the mounting trade conflict that would not leave either trump or xi , both men with very large egos , feeling that he had backed down
china has consistently promised to further open its markets since xi took office but has largely failed to follow through on those promises
it has also ignored years of entreaties from the u.s. administration and business community to level the playing field for foreign companies and resolve problems through dialogue and negotiation
while u.s. business leaders in china want to avoid a trade war , there is broad support for the idea that it is time to get tough with beijing
xi has made it clear that his vision for a socialist market economy is one where the communist party and state remain firmly in control , while protecting and subsidizing key industries
that approach , a fundamental bone of contention with washington , is not about to change , experts said
nevertheless financial markets were moderately encouraged
only last week , global share prices had tumbled as washington and beijing traded threats to impose tens of billions of dollars of tariffs on each others imports , in what was beginning to look like a high-stakes poker game
how trump risked a trade war with china and alienated u.s. allies in less than 30 days
the auto sector is one that trump has highlighted as a concern
to set up factories in china , foreign car companies are forced into 50-50 joint ventures with chinese companies , and many fear their valuable intellectual property will eventually find its way into chinese cars
vehicles imported from abroad face a 25 percent import tariff
in his speech , xi reiterated a long-standing promise to reduce restrictions on foreign investment in financial services , including banking , securities and insurance , and to strengthen protection for intellectual property , another of the u.s. administrations main complaints
he also announced that an international import expo would be held in shanghai in november to open up the chinese market.
xi also reiterated a call for developed nations in other words , the united states to ease restrictions on high-tech exports to china
that is not about to happen , with washington citing national security concerns that such technologies would find their way into chinas defense industry
trump pushes back on fears of a trade war with china
the process of reform and opening of chinas economy has been the driving force for decades of progress , innovation and development in his country , he added
while he made no direct mention of the trade war with the united states , he said a zero-sum and cold war mentality looks even more out of place than ever in the modern world
the peoples daily , the communist party mouthpiece , said china would never open its markets because of american pressure , but only for its own interests and at its own pace
and in an ominous warning for trump , it warned that market opening measures would not apply to those countries that violate the rules of the world trade organization and frequently launch trade wars.
on tuesday , china officially filed a trade complaint against the united states with the world trade organization over the steel and aluminum tariffs
