beijing a chinese government investigation has shed no light on why a u.s. diplomat fell ill at the consulate in guangzhou after hearing mysterious sounds , an official said thursday
on wednesday , the u.s. state department said it was evacuating several more americans from guangzhou for further health screenings
that followed the initial evacuation of a government employee who had reported hearing strange noises in his apartment and was exhibiting symptoms of brain injury
on thursday , the chinese foreign ministry said investigators looked into the case after being told about the first incident
we will maintain communication with the united states on this.
a diplomats mysterious illness could jeopardize chinas u.s. relationship
in guangzhou , the first employee to be evacuated complained of subtle and vague , but abnormal , sensations of sound and pressure , the state department said
now more cases have come to light , with a number of affected people sent to the united states for further evaluation , said state department spokeswoman heather nauert
a u.s. medical team in guangzhou was also screening more americans on thursday , the associated press reported
the latest round of evacuations , which began wednesday in china , was the first sign that the unexplained ailments have now broadened and threaten to become a full-blown health crisis like the one that affected at least 24 diplomats and their families in cuba

though no names were released , a foreign service officer , mark lenzi , told the washington post he would be evacuated along with his wife and 3-year-old son
lenzi said he began hearing unusual sounds in april 2017 , comparing them to rolling marbles with static
he said he started suffering excruciating headaches a few months later , as did his wife and son
lenzi also said the employee evacuated last month was his neighbor , a fellow foreign service officer who was diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury

the state department has said it suspects the stricken diplomats in cuba were purposely targeted for an attack
in response , it downsized the u.s. diplomatic staff in havana and prohibited families from joining the diplomats who stayed
the united states also expelled 15 cuban diplomats in retaliation , accusing cuba of failing to protect american envoys
but despite an investigation by the fbi that has lasted more than a year , u.s. officials have been unable to determine the cause of the injuries , much less identify the perpetrators
other researchers subsequently criticized the methods used in the study , saying that the neuropsychological evidence presented in the article was flimsy
separately , a group of researchers at the university of michigan suggested that ultrasound signals from two or more transmitters could have accidentally interfered with each other to produce an audible signal
the ultrasound signals could have come from eavesdropping devices , from jammers meant to block eavesdropping , or even from ultrasound pest repellents , the researchers said , raising the possibility that whatever or whoever caused the noise may have had no intent to harm
