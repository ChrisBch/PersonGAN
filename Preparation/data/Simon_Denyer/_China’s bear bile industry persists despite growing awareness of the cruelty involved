phung thuong , vietnam inside a row of rusting cages , 15 adult moon bears are imprisoned in varying degrees of apathy and distress
some lie on their backs in the tiny enclosures , unable even to stretch out others loll their heads or chew listlessly at the bars of the cage in tortured , repetitive motions
every few days , the bears are sedated , a needle is inserted into their gall bladders and bile is extracted to be sold as a cure for ailments as diverse as hemorrhoids and hangovers
more than 20,000 bears are kept , most in appalling conditions , across eastern asia to satisfy an age-old obsession with the medicinal and magical powers of products culled from exotic animals
yet there is a ray of hope for some of these bears , as public awareness of animal cruelty and welfare gradually rises across asia
last year , vietnams government promised to close down all of its bear farms by 2022 , after a pledge by the countrys traditional chinese medicine community to stop prescribing bear bile products by 2020
there has been progress as well in south korea , where the government completed a sterilization program on captive bears last year as part of an effort to phase out farming
outside these bright spots , however , the picture is much grimmer
china is the center of the industry and of demand for bear bile products
bear farming remains legal in china , and at least 10,000 bears are kept in cages on nearly 70 farms
asian black bears closely related to the american black bear live in mountains and forests from japan to china and across the himalayas to india
they are known as moon bears because of a white marking on their chests , roughly in the shape of a crescent moon
the first known record of the use of bear bile for its medicinal properties comes from a tang dynasty document that dates to a.d. 659
but the idea of farming living bears to extract bile originated in north korea in the early 1980s before rapidly spreading to china , vietnam and laos
studies show that the acid contained in bile does have medical benefits in dissolving gallstones or treating some liver disease , as well as some anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties
in vietnam , though , the industry is on the retreat
the government banned the poaching of wild animals in 1992 but allowed bear farming to continue even though the industry was being almost exclusively supplied from wild populations
in the years that followed , rising public pressure had an effect
in 2005 , shocked by how widespread bear farming had become , vietnam outlawed the extraction of bile while allowing farms to keep existing animals so they werent just slaughtered
the number of bears has fallen from a peak of more than 4,500 to just over 1,000 today , experts say
the village of phung thuong outside hanoi is where the industry developed in vietnam , and it remains the biggest holdout
in an area of a few square miles , and among a population of 15,000 people , there are about 195 bears in metal cages , many in small compounds straddling the main road
everyone knows that these farms still extract bile , says tuan bendixsen , vietnam country head of animals asia.
its obvious , he said
otherwise , why would farmers keep the bears alive
bear farmers have the biggest houses and the fanciest cars in the village
north of hanoi in tam dao national park , it is a different story
bears rescued from farms arrive at the animals asia sanctuary here with immense psychological and physical problems , some too weak to walk or climb after a lifetime in a cage
others have lost limbs from the metal traps used to capture them some are blind from stress-induced hypertension
many have to be gradually coaxed out of confined spaces to get used to their new freedoms
today , 175 recovering bears swim in pools , climb ladders and onto platforms , play gently with one another or stretch out in the shade
three times a day , workers place vegetables all across the enclosures for the bears to forage and find , an important part of their mental stimulation
but campaigners are struggling to replicate their vietnam success in china
there , bile extracted from bears , using processes that cause considerable pain , infection and disease , is baked into powder and sold in a variety of products including eye gel and toothpaste easily available in pharmacies
public opinion polls show that people in china overwhelmingly deem bear bile extraction to be cruel and support a ban on bear farming
but while china has moved to outlaw the trade in ivory , for example , international efforts to persuade it to end bear bile farming may have boomeranged
it is an example of the tightrope that animal welfare groups have to walk as they try to effect change in china without stepping on some very sensitive toes
a 2006 declaration by the european parliament , calling on the chinese government to end bear bile farming , merely served to provoke an angry defense of the industry from the state forestry administration
those sensitivities were exploited by the industry to discredit the campaign to end bear farming , unfairly portraying it as driven by multinational drug companies out to seize market share from chinese rivals
the industry was also boosted when president xi jinping threw his weight behind the domestic and global expansion of traditional chinese medicine , calling it a treasure of the chinese nation.
when it came to ivory , the chinese government realized that elephant poaching to satisfy chinese demand was damaging the countrys image in africa , a continent where china seeks to increase its influence
but with bears , china has dug in its heels
in 2013 , chinese wildlife groups generated enough public pressure to force fujian guizhentang pharmaceutical to abandon an initial public offering to raise funds to expand the bear farming industry
since then , though , chinese media outlets have been warned to avoid the subject , experts say
scientists at shenyang university in the countrys northeast created a synthetic alternative to bear bile more than two decades ago but were unable to get approval from the china food and drug administration
the development research center of the state council , a government think tank , issued a report in 2016 calling for the industry to be gradually closed down by 2035
faced with an internal backlash , the report was soon deleted from the organizations website
in march , a member of chinas national peoples congress , the countrys largely rubber-stamp parliament , introduced a proposal calling for bear farming to be phased out by 2035
shi minghai , president of the buddhist association of hebei province , said that china should take its cue from vietnam and south korea and end an industry that is damaging the countrys international image
the proposal , not the first of its kind , has not gained much traction
in vietnam , the bear bile industry was partly a victim of its own success as production rose , the price dropped
and as the price dropped , people began to consider bear bile less valuable
in china , though , the multimillion-dollar bear farming industry is thriving , and so far has outmaneuvered its critics
