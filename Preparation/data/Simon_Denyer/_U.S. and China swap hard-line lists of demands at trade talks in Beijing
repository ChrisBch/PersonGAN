beijing two days of inconclusive u.s.-china talks ended here friday amid signs that the trump administration is demanding dramatic concessions that challenge core elements of chinas economic system and its ambitions for future development
china said big differences remained as a high-level u.s. government delegation headed home , although it said consensus had been reached on some issues
given chinas equally uncompromising stance , it was unclear where the two sides had found common ground
u.s. envoys are likely to have met stiff resistance , given their demands for fundamental revisions in how the chinese leadership manages foreign trade and its domestic economy
the demands included a $ 200 billion cut in the u.s. trade deficit with china by 2020
trump is asking china to redo just about everything with its economy
the dueling negotiating menus represented maximalist positions that may make eventual agreement more difficult , said scott kennedy , who directs a project on the chinese economy at the center for strategic and international studies
with the u.s. team , including treasury secretary steven mnuchin , commerce secretary wilbur ross and u.s. trade representative robert e. lighthizer , en route to washington , the white house released a statement calling the talks frank.
the u.s. briefing paper , presented to chinese officials before the talks , said that the united states-china trade relationship is significantly unbalanced and that immediate action is needed to reduce the u.s. trade deficit
the paper appeared on the social media site weibo before being deleted by chinese government censors
the meetings marked an attempt by the trump administration to leverage changes from china without sparking a potentially disastrous trade war , after threatening to impose tariffs on up to $ 150 billion in chinese imports
said john frisbie , president of the u.s.-china business council.
the gaps pretty wide right now.
the talks ended with no details on next steps
but some analysts predicted tough bargaining in the weeks to come
u.s. negotiators will brief president trump upon their return
the president faces several critical decisions in coming weeks , including whether to impose threatened tariffs on chinese goods , even as he seeks beijings help in resolving a showdown over the north korean nuclear program
trump told reporters friday that he expects to meet north korean leader kim jong un , a china ally , very soon.
she said , and china is way too big to just let it go.
the united states wants china to take swift action to reduce the $ 375 billion deficit in goods trade by $ 200 billion by the end of 2020
washington also is seeking fundamental changes to the way chinas communist party runs its economy , taking aim at a massive state-subsidized effort to achieve global dominance in advanced technologies , known as made in china 2025.
said lu xiang , an expert in sino-u.s. relations at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing
the xinhua news agency reported that the two sides agreed to establish a working mechanism to maintain close communication on the issues discussed in the talks
opinion has the trade war started yet
its not like that.
u.s. sanctions against leading chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer zte have also cast a significant shadow over the trade relationship
last month , the commerce department barred u.s. companies from exporting to zte for seven years , saying the company violated a previous settlement of criminal and civil charges by making shipments to iran and north korea
that move was a big blow to zte , which has relied on u.s. chips and software to power its smartphones
but it has also reinforced chinas determination to accelerate the development of its own high-tech industries and reduce its reliance on the united states
chinas commerce ministry said it made solemn representations to the u.s. delegation over the zte case during the talks
