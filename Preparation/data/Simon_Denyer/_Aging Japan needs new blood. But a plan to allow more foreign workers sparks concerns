yokohama , japan as the united states and europe take steps to keep more people out , japan is cautiously moving to let more people in
this is a country that has long sought to defend its culture and its ethnic homogeneity by discouraging immigrants
now , with its population continuing to shrink and age , and its labor force dwindling , prime minister shinzo abe is thinking the previously unthinkable
this month , his government introduced a bill that aims to bring in hundreds of thousands of semiskilled foreign workers in the years ahead , opening japans doors as never before
he is careful to stress that this is not immigration , because these workers are not supposed to stay indefinitely , but it is still a shift that is being described as a watershed moment in the countrys modern history
critics say the plan is ill thought-out an immigration policy by stealth that will cause problems down the line
this is the biggest turning point in postwar japan , akira nagatsuma of the opposition center-left constitutional democratic party of japan told parliament , calling the governments proposal irresponsible and half-baked.
i am not saying no to foreign workers , he said
but he added that there needs to be rigorous planning and a meaningful debate on how to integrate foreigners into japanese society
what is not up for debate is the urgency of the situation
birthrates are falling across the developed world and populations are aging , but nowhere is this reality hitting harder than in japan
its population is expected to drop from about 127 million to 88 million by 2065
people over 65 already account for 28 percent of the population , and 500 schools close every year because of a lack of students
there have never been so few children in japan ( at least , not since they started counting )
letting in more people may be the only way to reverse the slide to stagnation and decline , experts say
the problem is what happens then
while the highly skilled have always been welcome , abe wants to allow in 345,000 semiskilled workers by 2024 , letting them come for a maximum of five years in about a dozen industries , including agriculture and construction
if they pass some still-unspecified tests at the end of that period , they could be allowed to stay for five more years , and even bring relatives
previous efforts to ease japans labor shortage have had mixed results
abe initially tried to attract more women and seniors back into the workforce and also sought to boost fertility rates , but those efforts could not overcome overwhelming demographic trends
in the late 1980s , japan opened its doors to the descendants of ethnic japanese who had emigrated at the beginning of the century , and hundreds of thousands came from latin america , especially brazil and peru
but even though they looked japanese , many barely spoke the language and many failed to integrate
in 2009 , after the global financial crisis , japan started offering them money to return home
workers of different ethnicities also came but under much more-restrictive policies
the main vehicle was the technical intern training program , or titp , introduced in 1993 , under which workers from other asian countries were supposed to be given training for three to five years before returning home
said lawyer yoshihito kawakami , adding that workers often do not receive any real training
the main problem , he said , is that the trainees visas are conditional on them not changing employers
if they complain , they face losing their jobs and being deported
some 270,000 foreigners , many from vietnam , china , the philippines and myanmar , work in japan under titp
yet , amid abuses inherent in the system , about 4,300 have absconded from the program in the past six months alone , with many going underground as undocumented workers
a similar number of foreign workers are here ostensibly as language students , officially allowed to work 28 hours a week but in practice often putting in longer hours in the countrys ubiquitous 24-hour convenience stores
nepalis might be a common sight behind the cash register in 7-elevens or familymarts in tokyo , but outside work they often live in dormitories and dont mix with locals
japans employees are literally working themselves to death
if abes bill passes , some foreign workers will bring relatives and some may stay long enough to gain permanent residency , as many of the arrivals from brazil and peru have done
it could represent a sea change for a country where few people speak foreign languages or have much contact with foreigners
that is approximately the ratio in germany
the problem is that japans unwillingness to acknowledge that it is accepting immigrants means no government funds are allocated for integration efforts , and there is no law against hate speech or discrimination against foreigners , kato and other experts say
masashi ichikawa of the japan bar association likens japan to germany in the 1970s , when it brought in guest workers from turkey without much thought to the long term
a lack of inclusion could be a recipe for social unrest , while an economic downturn could leave japan regretting how many people it allowed in , some experts warn
goshi hosono , an independent member of parliament , says the latest move , if handled strictly but humanely , could prove a positive one for japan
i think immigrants give vigor to the united states , for example , he said
others see things differently
the far-right japan first party held rallies across japan in october protesting abes plan , although the demonstrators were often outnumbered by activists accusing them of racism and hate speech
japan first commands little public support and has no seats in parliament , but there is a much larger group of japanese who worry foreigners could disrupt a country where crime rates are low
a backlash against immigration should be anticipated , said kei hakata , a professor at seikei university in tokyo , adding that hidden sentiments eventually emerge in voting patterns
its a defense mechanism at work.
