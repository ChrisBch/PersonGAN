sokcho , south korea kim kwang-ho was just 14 years old when his family was ripped in two during the korean war
it was december 1950 , and chinese troops were advancing on his small hometown
with his father , two older brothers and an older sister , he fled south , first on foot , then perched on top of a train and finally packed tightly into a transport ship
his mother stayed behind with his 10-year-old brother and several cousins , expecting to join them later when the fighting was over , the journey safer
it was to be the last time he ever saw or even heard from his mother , who , he has just found out , died in communist north korea in 1967
on monday , more than 67 years after they parted , he finally gets to see his younger brother again
kim is one of 172 south koreans traveling to north korea to meet relatives this week , in the first reunion of divided families to take place in three years , as relations thaw between the neighbors
these reunions are simultaneously a reminder of the deep bonds between the two nations , and an illustration of how far they have grown apart in the decades since their painful division
the reunion program began in 1985 , stalled , then got underway at the turn of the millennium
in all , more than 17,000 south koreans have taken part in more than 20 meetings , seeing their relatives in person or over video link
but more than 130,000 have registered as members of divided families since the program began , and more than half of them died before getting to see their relatives again
many on the waiting list are older than 90
some barely recognize the relatives they do get to meet
he remembers dozing off on top of the train carrying him toward the port of hungnam , snow piling on his shoulders
but he cant remember his brothers face , or even his mothers anymore
he will come bearing gifts some warm jackets , socks , soap and cosmetics for his brothers wife , and two packets of choco pies , the cake-and-marshmallow chocolate sandwich snack made in south korea but particularly coveted in the north
participants are discouraged from bringing cash , and he has chosen not to , worried that his brother probably wouldnt get to keep it anyway
luxury goods , including expensive bottles of spirits or watches , are also banned under u.n. sanctions
on sunday , the south koreans gathered in the city of sokcho , for a briefing on how to behave and what they can and can not say , before traveling monday by bus across the border to the north korean resort of mount kumgang
kim and his brother will have to stay in different hotels , but they will be brought together for group reunions , dinner banquets and lunches between monday and wednesday , including a three-hour individual meeting on tuesday when they will exchange gifts
southern participants are advised not to criticize the north korean leadership or ask about the countrys economic situation in case it causes problems for their relatives
and if their counterparts start singing propaganda songs or making political statements a common problem in the past participants are advised to naturally lead the conversation to another topic.
gifts of a propaganda-type nature should be politely refused
still , kim is looking forward to hearing about his mother , and about how his hometown has changed
then , on wednesday , after just 11 hours together , he and his brother will part again , almost certainly for the last time
the meetings are like a sudden spark of light after nearly seven decades of darkness
many people have heard nothing about their relatives in the north during that time and are nervous about who and what they will encounter
and then , after the brief meeting , darkness will reign once again
kim said , but these reunions are one-time-only meetings.
yun jung-sik applied to see his older sister , whom he last saw when he was 12 in 1950
she was already married by then , with two young children , and when the rest of the family fled south , she stayed behind with her husbands family
ten days ago , yun found out he had been selected for this round of family reunions
but he also learned his sister had died 25 years ago
instead , he will meet her children , his nephew and niece
he knows nothing about them except their names and ages , 71 and 70 respectively
he and his wife will bring $ 260 in cash each , as well as clothes eight pieces for women , in different sizes , and five for men some vitamin pills , and , of course , some choco pies
there is a good chance they will be
daily nk , a south korean news service with contacts inside the north , reported last week that only north koreans seen as loyal to the regime will be chosen for the reunions
that could rule out many people
north koreans whose relatives had fled south were often seen as suspect and placed in the lowest rungs of the countrys heavily stratified society , experts say
either way , those who do get chosen have to undergo a month of political indoctrination to make sure they say the right things , said choe eun-bum , who worked for many years at the red cross to reunite divided families
he said , which immediately casts a chill over the long-awaited reunion.
the 14-year-old kim sailed south on the ss meredith victory , a u.s
merchant marine ship that was nicknamed the ship of miracles for carrying 14,000 refugees on that voyage , the largest land evacuation by a single ship
also on board were the parents of south korean president moon jae-in
moon accompanied his mother to meet her younger sister during one of the reunions in 2004 , and says his personal history shapes his own desire for peace
