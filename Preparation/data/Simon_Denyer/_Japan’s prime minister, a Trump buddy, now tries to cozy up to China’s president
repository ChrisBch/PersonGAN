beijing chinese economic reformer deng xiaoping traveled to tokyo exactly 40 years ago this week to mark the signing of the sino-japanese peace and friendship treaty , as the two countries attempted to put the memories of wars behind them
deng told the japanese prime minister at the time , between visits to high-tech factories and marveling at japans bullet trains
four decades later , china has overtaken japan as the worlds second-largest economy and is producing high-speed trains of its own
but the same thoughts may well be running through president xi jinpings mind today
now , in the middle of an increasingly bitter trade war with the united states , xi will on thursday welcome japanese prime minister shinzo abe for their first bilateral meeting in more than seven years
xi will host abe at a reception , attended by about 500 japanese business leaders , in beijings opulent great hall of the people on thursday night , for a celebration marking the 40th anniversary of the treaty
then they will have a day of meetings friday during which they will pledge to work together on economic cooperation projects in countries such as thailand
they expected to reach agreements on more than 30 such infrastructure projects
trump and chinas xi to meet in bid to end trade war tensions
its a far cry from 2014 , when friction over a group of disputed islands in the east china sea raised fears the two countries would become involved in a military conflict
japanese companies pulled out of china in droves , and the two leaders had a famously awkward encounter at an apec meeting
but over the past year , the two countries have started to repair their relationship , at least superficially
chinas foreign minister and premier have both visited japan this year , and the number of chinese tourists following suit is expected to reach a record 8 million this year
japan was the top destination for chinese travelers during this months golden week holiday , according to travel website c-trip
then theres the trump factor
china is eagerly trying to improve economic relations with a raft of rich countries to try to reduce its exposure to the united states , where president trump has slapped tariffs on $ 250 billion worth of chinese imports and is threatening more
chinese premier li keqiang just came back from a trip touting chinese market access to european companies , while beijing is redoubling its efforts to forge a trade deal called the regional comprehensive economic partnership
there are even murmurs that china might try to join the trans-pacific partnership , the 11-country trade deal that trump pulled out of in his first week in office
japan , a neighbor and chinas second-biggest export market after the united states , is an important part of this diversification effort
this appears to be a tactical move , analysts in tokyo say
said narushige michishita of japans national graduate institute for policy studies
japans abe stakes out new identity in region stronger leadership and wider military reach
a japanese government official said , speaking on the condition of anonymity to preview the sensitive visit
china is already japans largest trading partner , and more than 30,000 japanese companies operate here , pumping more than $ 3.3 billion in direct investment into the country each year and the market is only becoming more attractive
chinas middle class totals about 250 million people , double the entire population of japan
that represents a tantalizing opportunity for consumer goods companies in particular , like shiseido , the skin care company
but japan has a tricky balancing act
abe has poured an enormous amount of energy into developing a personal connection with trump , and the military alliance with the united states is the cornerstone of japans security
chinas global times nationalist tabloid made it clear that abe should pay attention to how he balances his competing interests
china tells trump administration to stop its misguided actions and allegations
but beijing knows where japans loyalties lie , said zhou yongsheng , a japan expert at china foreign affairs university in beijing
regardless of the american factor , there is a limit to how much better relations can get
there are still plenty of historical issues causing frictions between the two countries
abe is determined to revise the pacifist constitution imposed on japan after world war ii and returning the country to a normal footing with a full-fledged military , not just self-defense forces.
but beijing sees this as a sign of aggression and has strongly protested abes efforts to date
there are also the continued skirmishes over the disputed islands in the east china sea , which japan controls but china claims
said sun of stimson
indeed , all is not forgotten
abe was initially supposed to arrive in beijing on oct. 23 , the same day 40 years earlier than deng had arrived in tokyo
but then the chinese government realized that another anniversary fell on oct. 23 , said author bill bishop , editor of the sinocism china newsletter
that is the 150th anniversary of japans meiji restoration , the day of the creation of the japanese government that later rampaged through asia , including in china
some anniversaries , it seems , are better left unmarked
