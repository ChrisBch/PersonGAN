the trump administration has agreed to relax its punishment of chinese telecom company zte , commerce secretary wilbur ross said thursday
the company will pay a $ 1 billion fine and fund a new in-house compliance team staffed by u.s. experts , ross told cnbc
the move eases a seven-year ban on zte buying american parts , which commerce levied in april
at the time , the chinese government complained that the action could put the company , a major employer and star of the chinese technology industry , out of business
the commerce department action came after president trump tweeted last month that he planned to help zte because too many jobs in china would otherwise be lost
the presidents extraordinary intervention in an enforcement matter drew widespread criticism on capitol hill from members of both parties
reaction thursday was no warmer
house minority leader nancy pelosi ( d-calif. ) said thursday
senate minority leader charles e. schumer ( d-n.y. ) called for congress to reverse the decision , which is unlikely
a proposal by sen. chris van hollen ( d-md )
to bar such forgiveness for chinese telecom companies is not retroactive and thus would not cover the zte deal , according to an analysis by cowen research group
under the 23-page definitive agreement announced by ross , zte also is required to change its entire board of directors and executive team within 30 days
the government will hold $ 400 million of ztes money in escrow as a hedge against future violations by the company , which last year settled criminal and civil charges in connection with its violation of u.s. sanctions on iran and north korea
zte was found to have shipped its sophisticated telecommunications equipment to both countries , which the state department lists as supporters of terrorism , and to have repeatedly lied to u.s. investigators about its actions
the company paid $ 892 million in fines , with an additional $ 300 million suspended to encourage compliance with the settlement
the $ 400 million escrow likely includes those suspended funds , according to doug jacobson , a washington , d.c. , trade attorney
he said the new agreement expands provisions in last years settlement , which provided for an independent compliance monitor to oversee the companys activities
carlos gutierrez , who was commerce secretary under president george w. bush , said the change in the u.s. penalty likely averted a worsening in relations with china
since the original u.s. penalty would have put zte out of business , chinese authorities would have retaliated against a prominent u.s. company , he said
ross insisted thursday that the zte matter was quite separate and apart from ongoing trade talks with china
but the president has repeatedly spoken of the enforcement matter as part of efforts to overhaul the u.s. commercial relationship with china
to satisfy trumps demand for a reduction in the $ 375 billion in goods u.s. trade deficit with china , the government in beijing has reportedly offered to buy up to $ 70 billion more each year in u.s. products
that offer is conditioned on the president dropping his threat to impose tariffs on up to $ 150 billion in chinese imports
eric altbach , a former deputy assistant u.s. trade representative who spent years negotiating with the chinese , said the united states may have agreed to go easier on zte in exchange for china approving an american companys acquisition of a chinese firm
u.s. chipmaker qualcomm has been trying to buy nxp semiconductors of the netherlands , but given the companys global reach , the deal had to be approved by numerous countries antitrust regulators , including chinas
the chinese government has delayed the deal as trade frictions intensified
with the zte matter resolved , the deal may advance
both companies share prices rose thursday , with nxp up more than 6 percent in midday trading
but some analysts said that trading lenience on zte for chinese agreement to buy more american products would leave major issues unresolved
said samm sacks , a senior fellow in the center for strategic and international studies technology program
the trump administration has complained about a range of chinese industrial policies that it says disadvantages u.s. companies , including compulsory licensing arrangements and rampant theft of trade secrets
amid mounting trade tension between the united states and china , lawmakers have grown increasingly critical of the national security threat from telecom companies such as zte and huawei
the pentagonin may ordered retail outlets on u.s. military bases to remove from the shelves smartphones made by the two companies
there was no immediate comment from the chinese government on the zte agreement
mei xinyu , a researcher with a ministry of commerce think tank , said a deal would ease tensions
but the chinese worry that trump will not stick to any agreement
the chinese commerce ministry said thursday that some progress was made in talks that ended last weekend
commerce ministry spokesman gao feng told a weekly news conference
but he declined to confirm reports that china had offered to increase agriculture and energy imports by $ 70 billion , as reuters news agency has reported
