tokyo its all chinas fault , at least according to president trump , who again blamed beijing late wednesday for an impasse in negotiations with pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs
but several experts said the real problem lies much closer to home , in trumps casual approach to negotiations with the north koreans and the vague , oral promises exchanged at his meeting with the north korean leader in singapore in june
citing multiple individuals familiar with the negotiations , vox reported wednesday that trump told kim jong un in singapore that he would sign a declaration to end the korean war soon after their meeting
since then , the trump administration has repeatedly asked pyongyang to first dismantle most of its nuclear arsenal
that explains the current stalemate in negotiations , vox reported
said robert kelly , a professor of political science at pusan national university in south korea.
thats trumps blunder.
the bill comes due
this was exactly the risk of trump freelancing in singapore making promises to kim jong un ( and earlier kim yong chol ) that the administration could not and would not deliver on
things may quickly heat back up , and this one is squarely on trump
the bill comes due , tweeted vipin narang , an associate professor of political science at mit
this was exactly the risk of trump freelancing in singapore making promises to kim jong un ( and earlier kim yong chol ) that the administration could not and would not deliver on.
secretary of state mike pompeo , by contrast , has asked pyongyang to surrender 60 to 70 percent of its nuclear warheads in six to eight months , according to vox , explaining why he was greeted with such hostility in north korean state media
trumps decision to call off pompeos latest trip to pyongyang came after the north koreans warned in a letter to pompeo last week that talks with the united states risked falling apart , as first reported by the washington posts josh rogin
rogin said the idea of declaring an end to the war faced significant internal opposition within the administration , particularly from national security adviser john bolton and defense secretary jim mattis
suh hoon , director of south koreas national intelligence service , told a closed-door parliamentary hearing tuesday that pompeos trip was canceled over the competing demands from the two sides
suh was quoted as saying by lawmaker kim min-ki
an unnamed spokesman was quoted as saying , referring to north korea by the initials of its official name
it also mentioned trumps alleged enthusiasm for the step
the korean war ended in 1953 with an armistice , not a formal peace agreement
a declaration of an end to the war is seen by its supporters as a way to signal of an end to hostilities between the two koreas and between north korea and the united states
but it would be only a first step toward a full peace treaty involving the complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula
skeptics argue it would give the north koreans too great a reward without securing any real progress on dismantling their nuclear program and could ultimately undermine the u.s.-south korea military alliance
south korean efforts to persuade washington and pyongyang to move simultaneously on the two steps have so far foundered , the atlantic reported this week
pusan national universitys kelly said trump offered the north koreans a huge amount in singapore , including the suspension of military exercises with south korea , without getting concrete promises in return
at his news conference after the singapore summit , trump was asked about the possibility of a peace agreement to formally end the korean war
when he called off pompeos planned visit last week , trump blamed a lack of progress toward denuclearization , but he also said china was not helping as much as in the past because of the trade dispute between beijing and washington
it was a theme he returned to wednesday
statement from the white housepresident donald j. trump feels strongly that north korea is under tremendous pressure from china because of our major trade disputes with the chinese government
at the same time , we also know that china is providing north korea with ...
chinas foreign ministry called trumps comments irresponsible and hard to understand , reuters reported
foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying told a regular news conference that china could not accept the various ways trump tried to pin the blame on beijing
she said , according to the global times
meanwhile , the breakdown in talks has forced the government in seoul to recalibrate , experts said
south korean media have reported on mounting speculation that the proposed opening of a joint inter-korean liaison office inside north korea , supposed to take place in august , might be delayed although the government has said only that consultations are still underway
he added that south korean president moon jae-in is bound to take a more prudent approach toward deeper economic cooperation with the north when he visits pyongyang in september
