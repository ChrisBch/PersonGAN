tokyo north korea has threatened to restart the development of its nuclear weapons program unless the united states lifts sanctions , underscoring one of the major potential stumbling blocks in washingtons diplomatic outreach to north korean leader kim jong un
the trump administration has insisted that sanctions and other pressures remain on north korea until it dismantles its nuclear program
kims regime , however , has always demanded a step-by-step process of denuclearization that would include lifting u.s. sanctions along the way
in the past month , pyongyang has stepped up its calls for sanctions relief
the statement released late friday by its foreign ministry is the latest indication that negotiations over the nuclear program have hit an impasse
the issue of sanctions has also created a rift between seoul and washington
south korea has backed the norths call for sanctions relief and is keen to get moving on an ambitious program of economic development and cooperation , including building road and rail links across the countries heavily militarized frontier
north korea appears to raise its demands
the north korean foreign ministry warned that unless sanctions were lifted and washington stopped behaving arrogantly , north korea could reinstate pyongjin its policy of simultaneously developing its nuclear weapons program alongside seeking economic development
in april , kim declared that the countrys nuclear weapons program was sufficiently advanced and that pyongjin would be replaced by a focus on improving the economy
backtracking could reignite tensions with the united states
still , neither side has turned its back on negotiations
secretary of state mike pompeo told journalists he will meet his north korean counterpart for further talks in the coming week , although he did not specify exactly when , where or with whom those talks would take place
pompeo met kim last month in pyongyang , and he says he secured a promise to allow american inspectors into two nuclear and missile testing sites to check on their dismantlement
pompeo said , adding that kim had made clear to him that he intends to denuclearize but that much more work needs to be done
to pyongyang , that oft-repeated refrain about pressure is the problem
north korea says trump promised kim in june that a new era in relations was beginning
the foreign ministry asked washington to abandon its foolish daydream that sanctions and pressure will lead to denuclearization.
we can not help laughing at such a foolish idea , it said
the two koreas agree to push ahead with road , rail links despite sanctions
the united states , it added , was making a mistake if it believed north korea would agree to unilateral disarmament with sanctions in place , and it said negotiations should be simultaneous and phased and based on reciprocity and equality.
