altanbulag , mongolia it was another harsh winter on the central mongolian steppe , with temperatures dropping to nearly 50 below zero and thick snow covering the rolling grasslands
more than a million cattle , sheep and goats , weakened by a dry summer , died , while nomads precious horses froze to death on their feet
here on the central asian steppe , the ancient home of genghis khan and his mongol horde , the nomads are brought up tough
yet their ancient lifestyle is under threat as never before
global climate change , combined with local environment mismanagement , government neglect and the lure of the modern world , has created a toxic cocktail
every year , thousands more herders abandon their way of life and head for mongolias crowded capital , ulaanbaatar , which holds half the nations population
climate change is a major culprit , and mongolia , landlocked and far from the moderating effects of the ocean , is suffering more than most parts of the world
at the best of times , this is a fragile climate , with little rainfall and huge variations in temperature , which is why this vast territory supports a population of only 3 million people , making it the worlds most sparsely populated country
now , government figures show average temperatures have risen by about 2.2 degrees celsius ( 4.0 degrees fahrenheit ) since systematic records began in 1940 well above the global average rise of about 0.85 degrees celsius ( 1.53 degrees fahrenheit ) since 1880
summers , when most of the rainfall occurs , have become drier , and extreme climate events have become more frequent , said purevjav gomboluudev , head of climate research at mongolias information and research institute of meteorology , hydrology and environment
now all that water is gone , she said
hundreds of rivers , lakes and springs have dried up across the country , the environment ministry says
and as the water retreats , the desert advances
roughly three-quarters of mongolias land is degraded or suffering desertification , with about a quarter seriously affected , said damdin dagvadorj , managing director of the climate change and development academy
but mongolias mismanaged twin transitions are also to blame
in the soviet era , mongolia , a satellite state , kept nomadism under tight control
animals were kept under collective ownership , but their numbers were limited , while the state supplied veterinary services , winter fodder and a guaranteed market
in 1990 , as the soviet union disintegrated , mongolia threw off its one-party state and became a democracy
three years later , it began privatizing the herds
what followed was a huge expansion in animal numbers as individual herders valued their worth by how much livestock they held
state support simultaneously vanished almost overnight
today , 66 million livestock roam the mongolian steppe , nearly three times the 23 million cap maintained in the communist era
overgrazing is a major cause of pastureland degradation , especially by the voracious and sharp-hooved goats whose numbers have exploded to supply the valuable trade in cashmere
rampant , uncontrolled mining also uses huge amounts of groundwater , pushing the water table ever lower
at the same time , the government has failed to extend education , health care and veterinary care to remote herding communities , said ulambayar tungalag of the saruul khuduu environmental research center.
there is no incentive to stay in rural areas , she said
and inequality is rising eighty percent of the livestock is controlled by the richest 20 percent of owners , among them elite city dwellers who pay others to look after their herds
more than 220,000 mongolian families depend on herding , but more than half have fewer than 200 animals , government figures show , well below the 250-to-300 threshold considered economically sustainable
herders may have solar panels , smartphones and televisions , but life isnt getting any easier
families are separated for much of the year as children head for boarding schools in the nearest towns , sometimes with mothers tagging along
in the winter , altantuya stays , getting up at first light to dig frozen cowpats out of the snow to build a fire , with batbold heading out to protect the animals from wolves , wind and snow
quentin moreau , country director for avsf ( agronomists and veterinarians without borders ) , a french nonprofit group supporting smallholder farming , says no investment is being made to make herders lives easier
projects to promote quality over quantity for example , by rewarding herders with higher prices for better-quality cashmere are still too small-scale to make a difference , and government plans to promote intensive farming make no sense on the water-starved grasslands , he said
moreau fears an acceleration of the rural exodus to the point where the system of villages and towns serving herders is no longer sustainable
what few social services that are available could disappear entirely
yet the lure of the capital often proves to be a mirage
a century ago , the town that is now ulaanbaatar was little more than a trading post and a monastery
today , it is a sprawling mess of 1.4 million people , half living in soviet-style apartments , half in the sprawling , unplanned ger districts where people have pitched their homes on the hills surrounding the city
mongolians are a people deeply connected to nature , who call their country the land of the eternal blue sky
but their capital has become the land of choking smog , as ger dwellers burn coal to ward off the cold
in winter , the capital has some of the worst air pollution in the world
cases of respiratory infections have nearly tripled in a decade , pneumonia is a leading cause of death for infants , and children living in the center of the city have 40 percent lower lung function than those in rural areas , unicef says
residents of ger districts lack access to running water , while jobs for rural migrants are few and poorly paid a watchman , a cook , a driver perhaps
many people lack the skills to succeed here
during festivals and important events , politicians like to don the national costume the herders calf-length tunic , or deel but are doing nothing to protect the source of that culture , tungalag said
meanwhile , in urban society , herders are often stigmatized , their lifestyles looked down upon
