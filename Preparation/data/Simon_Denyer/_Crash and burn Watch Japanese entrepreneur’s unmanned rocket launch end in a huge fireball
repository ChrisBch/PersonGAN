tokyo talk about crash and burn
a rocket developed by a controversial japanese entrepreneur burst into flames and crashed to earth in a fireball during the weekend
the momo-2 rocket was developed by interstellar technologies , a start-up that was partially crowdfunded and aims to lower the cost of spaceflight
its founder is takafumi horie , a colorful internet entrepreneur and convicted fraudster , who says he wants to start by putting small satellites into space and ultimately , like u.s. entrepreneurs elon musk and jeffrey p. bezos , send private citizens into space
but his second major launch ended in spectacular failure on saturday morning , according to kyodo news
the 30-foot rocket was supposed to reach 60 miles into space instead , it barely managed to lift off before flames started to shoot from its base and it crashed back down to earth
the crash , at a test site near the town of taiki on japans hokkaido island , caused no injuries
it was the second failure for the start-up after engineers lost contact with the first rocket 66 seconds after it launched last july
momo-1 fell into the sea after reaching a height of about 12 miles , the nikkei asian review reported at the time
in a facebook post , interstellar technologies apologized for failing to meet the expectations of the hundreds of people who had traveled to taiki to watch the dawn launch , but said it would continue to challenge the universe.
hories career achieved spectacular liftoff when he dropped out of college to launch the internet portal livedoor in 1995 , becoming a symbol of a new , modern entrepreneur in japan and an icon for many young people
he flouted convention by wearing t-shirts rather than the conventional shirt and tie but also raised eyebrows with his flashy lifestyle , driving a silver-blue ferrari and owning a racehorse carrying his nickname horiemon based on his supposed resemblance to the manga-anime robotic cat doraemon
he is the author of several best-selling books with titles such as the one who makes money wins.
hories career eventually crashed to earth when he was convicted of securities fraud in 2007 and served 21 months in prison
unlike musk and bezos , whose personal fortunes have backed their space ambitions , funds have been running low for hories interstellar technologies , forcing him to partially crowdfund his latest launch , according to the nikkei asian review
