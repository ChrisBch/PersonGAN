li chunke began carving ivory after leaving school as a 15-year-old boy
today , at 68 , this master craftsman is working until the early hours of every morning , trying to finish a 20-inch statuette of buddha on an unforgiving deadline before china implements a total ban on ivory sales at the end of this month
the art of ivory carving survived even the tumult of china 's cultural revolution , but he 's worried it may soon die out
what makes china great is that its traditional culture still exists , he said
if it disappears in china , it will be a loss for the whole world
the chinese government shut down 67 ivory-carving workshops and retail outlets in march , and will have closed the remaining 105 by the end of this year , honoring a commitment president xi jinping first made alongside president barack obama in 2015
china 's ban is one of the most important things that has happened to elephants in the last 10 years , said iain douglas-hamilton , one of the world 's leading elephant conservationists and founder of save the elephants
it 's a highly significant step , and i think the impact is increasingly being felt in parts of africa
but although the net is tightening , the battle is not won at all , he said
poaching levels have dropped slightly in each of the past five years , according to research for the convention on international trade in endangered species ( cites ) , and stronger law enforcement efforts have pushed ivory seizures to a record high
but the total number of elephants in africa is still thought to be declining because of illegal killings
however , the looming prospect of china 's ban appears to have pricked the speculative bubble that had contributed to the poaching crisis
the wholesale price of raw ivory in china is reported to have fallen by almost two-thirds in the past three years , from $ 2,100 per kilogram in 2014 to $ 730 in february 2017
china had been the world 's biggest ivory market
until this year , craftsmen were legally allowed to work with ivory from a stockpile imported in 2008 but that business provided cover for a vast illegal trade
at the peak of the ivory boom , from 2010 to 2012 , more than 30,000 elephants were slaughtered every year , research showed
but the global conservation movement fought back instead of pointing fingers , advocates made china feel part of a joint effort to end the trade , involving source countries , transit countries and destination countries , said john scanlon , secretary general of cites
it helped that xi wanted to curb corruption
ivory was a popular gift to woo an official or grease a business deal
poaching was also damaging china 's image in africa , where it has been investing and gaining influence
within china , a public awareness campaign was crafted by the san francisco-based group wildaid , backed by state media and fronted by former national basketball association player yao ming and other chinese celebrities
most chinese people had not been aware before then that elephants had to die for their ivory to be harvested
with a total ban in place , the job for law enforcement will be much easier any sales of elephant ivory anywhere in china will soon be illegal
yet the battle to win over the chinese consumer is far from over
a survey released wednesday by two affiliated wildlife organizations , traffic and the world wildlife fund , found that less than half of consumers surveyed recalled having heard of the ivory ban
after being told of the ban , most people said they would support it , and many said they had already stopped buying ivory
but the survey found a die-hard 19 percent of consumers who were inclined to keep buying ivory , even after it is banned
in beijing , shopkeepers are offering heavy discounts to shift stock before the ax falls
an intricately carved tusk in one outlet was recently reduced from nearly $ 1 million to around $ 600,000 , and other items were offered with similar discounts
but just outside china 's borders , ivory is still openly on sale and is still being eagerly snapped up by some chinese consumers
a study by save the elephants released in september found that laos was the fastest-growing ivory market in the world , with chinese tourists buying up 80 percent of the ivory on sale there at prices significantly lower than in china
vietnam is another big market , with ivory openly on sale and smugglers crossing back and forth across the border to supply chinese consumers , said zhou fei , head of the china wildlife programs for traffic
the golden triangle , a lawless opium-producing region straddling burma , thailand and laos , is another region where chinese-run businesses supply chinese consumers with african ivory , experts say
cambodia has become another transit point for the illegal trade
earlier this month , officials there seized nearly 1.1 tons of ivory hidden in hollowed-out logs
when you tighten the screws in one place , criminal groups will target another place , scanlon said
the last thing we want to do is let the pressure off and think we 've won yet
peter knights , chief executive at wildaid , applauds china 's leadership , but he laments that britain is dragging its feet and that japan is the only major consumer still unwilling to join the global effort
under obama , the united states tightened federal laws to ban cross-border and interstate trade seven states have enacted their own intrastate bans
china took the first step , and it needs to feel that other countries are supporting it and also stepping up to the plate , said grace ge gabriel , asia director for the international fund for animal welfare
in november , the u.s
fish and wildlife authority set alarm bells ringing in the conservation community by announcing it would reverse a ban on trophy-hunting imports from zimbabwe and zambia
two days later , trump tweeted that elephant hunting is a horror show and put the move on hold
there were leaders on the republican side in congress and fox news hosts pleading with him not to allow elephant trophy hunting , said iris ho , wildlife program manager for the humane society international in washington
on the elephant protection issue , there is strong bipartisan support , especially on the republican side
yet , despite the global concerns , knights and ho say china is unlikely to waver
do n't forget , this ban came from the top , knights said
once these things happen , they do n't tend to get reversed
china sees this as a matter of pride
ivory carving in china traces its origins to the ming and qing dynasties , from the 14th to the early 20th centuries , when the craft 's main consumers came from the imperial court and elite scholar-officials
it was revived after the communist takeover in 1949 but soon ran into trouble
at first , li said , ivory carvers were banned from traditional subjects and had to focus instead on modern art , including scenes from revolutionary ballets like the red detachment of women
but revolutionary art did n't sell , and mao 's government needed foreign currency
by 1968 , li and his fellow carvers were ordered to return to more traditional subjects , carving pieces that would be sold abroad to earn foreign exchange
outside , they were destroying the four olds
inside , we were creating the four olds , he said
today , he loves carving people and conveying emotion in his figures , as well as creating impossibly intricate images of flowers , birds , mountains and rivers
every piece of ivory he carved , he insists , came from approved and certified sources , and never from poachers
