beijing chinas premier warned about rising global protectionism and vowed a bolder approach to reform in a key address to parliament monday , but experts said his governments actions belie such rhetoric
chinas communist party has barely missed an opportunity to claim the moral high ground over trade and globalization since president trump set the united states on a more inward-looking and protectionist path
last week , trump announced sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports , provoking sharp criticism from canada and the european union , and sparking fears of a trade war
at the opening session of the annual meeting of the national peoples congress , li keqiang painted a picture of a china on a courageous path of economic reform and trade liberalization in the face of rising global protectionism
li said china , which restricts foreign investment in many sectors , would open up its economy to foreign investors and its markets more widely to foreign trade , echoing promises made in previous years speeches
more generally , the premier vowed that china would be bolder in reform
li said , adding that it remains a game-changing move as china seeks to build what it calls a great modern socialist country by the centenary of the founding of communist china in 2049
trump insists trade wars are good , and easy to win after vowing new tariffs
the irony is that , in some ways , china may be moving in the opposite direction , experts say
meanwhile , the space for free speech , academic debate and advocacy also has been significantly curtailed
trumps protectionist rhetoric , however , had allowed china an opportunity to seize the high ground , even if the reality is very different , balding added
lis speech also was full of references to the need to rally further around the core leadership of president xi jinping and to follow xi in thought and action even more closely
an anti-corruption drive that has dragged down tens of thousands of officials has ensured much stricter loyalty to xis ideas and orders , experts say
in the communist partys guiding document , further cementing xis position as the most powerful chinese leader in decades
one of xis central ideas is that the communist party should play a leading role in every aspect of the nations life , including in culture and the economy
li vowed to completely open up the general manufacturing sector and allow more access to sectors such as telecommunications , medical services , education , elderly care and new-energy vehicles
but experts said the proof would come when those promises were acted upon
despite the contrast between the rhetoric coming out of beijing and washington , the reality is that u.s. markets remain far more open than chinese ones
on internet and press freedom , the contrast is even more marked
china boosts defense budget seeking world-class military , but tells neighbors not to worry
in his speech , li said china was fighting three critical battles to forestall economic and financial risks , to step up poverty alleviation and to make greater progress in addressing pollution
he vowed , as he has before , to cut taxes and red tape for businesses , improve broadband internet access and make china a country of innovators.
but there is no cause for alarm on the economy , he said
we are fully capable of forestalling systemic risks.
in october , central bank governor zhou xiaochuan warned that china needed to take action to prevent a minsky moment a sudden collapse of asset prices after a long period of growth
that was an uncharacteristically blunt comment from a chinese official that suggested deeper concern behind closed doors about growing financial risks around rising levels of debt and high asset prices , balding said
meanwhile , a recently announced bailout of anbang insurance group could cost $ 50 billion , he said
nevertheless , li noted that chinas economy had grown at an annual average rate of 7.1 percent over the past five years
the 2018 growth target has been set at about 6.5 percent
