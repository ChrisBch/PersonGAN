beijing the u.s. embassy in china issued a second health alert friday , warning u.s. citizens about a mystery illness apparently caused by unexplained sounds that has already prompted the evacuation of several diplomats and family members
should seek medical advice , the alert said
the mystery illness , apparently caused by unexplained sounds heard in diplomats homes in china , appears similar to a series of cases that struck u.s. and canadian diplomats and their families in cuba beginning in late 2016
it has baffled medical experts and the fbi , despite extensive investigations and research
since that case was made public last month , an undisclosed number of other consular staff and family members have also been evacuated for further tests
a u.s. medical team is in guangzhou doing initial evaluations to see whether more people need to be sent home , the associated press has reported
the alert , the second in two weeks on the subject , told americans they should not attempt to locate the source of any unidentified auditory sensation
instead , it said , they should move to a different location
u.s. diplomat in china describes strange noises and subsequent illness
in cuba , 24 u.s. embassy employees and family members were ultimately evacuated , along with 10 canadians
the u.s. diplomatic presence in havana was scaled back , and 15 cuban diplomats were sent home from the united states in retaliation for their countrys apparent failure to protect diplomats
but an fbi investigation that lasted more than a year failed to find the cause of the sounds or the illness
the fact that the same phenomenon may now be happening in china raises a number of questions
was cuba unfairly blamed for the first incident , and could a different country or actor be involved
why have only americans and canadians so far been affected
is there some other technical explanation that does not involve deliberate foul play
chinas government said it conducted an investigation after the first incident here but found no cause or clue as to what might be behind the symptoms
the idea that this could be some sort of mass hysteria appeared to have been ruled out in a study by university of pennsylvania researchers
it showed that patients suffered sustained injury to their brain networks without any history of head trauma , similar to a concussion but without a blow to the head
no toxins have been found
a virus was thought unlikely because the patients showed no signs of fever , and no cuban staff at the embassies fell ill
instead , most patients associated their symptoms with loud , painful noises heard inside their apartments , chirps , hums , tones and even sounds like metal scraping coming from a distinct direction
the noises were often associated with vibrations or air pressure changes , similar to air resonating in a moving car with the windows partially rolled down
as a result , they exhibited signs of damage to their hearing , vision , balance and memory
controversy surrounds research on state department employees sickened in attacks
a group of researchers at the university of michigan suggested that ultrasound signals from two or more transmitters could have accidentally interfered with each other to produce an audible signal
the ultrasound signals could have come from eavesdropping devices , from jammers meant to block eavesdropping , or even from ultrasound pest repellents , the researchers said , raising the possibility that whatever or whoever caused the noise may have had no intent to harm
but if that was the cause , why have the devices not been found and identified by the fbi
meanwhile , the investigation is ongoing
