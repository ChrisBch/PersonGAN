yokohama , japan nissan said monday that chairman carlos ghosn has been arrested and will be dismissed after the japanese automaker uncovered significant acts of misconduct , including underreporting his own salary and using company assets for his personal benefit
ghosn is considered one of the car industrys top executives and is one of the highest-paid corporate bosses in japan
he is widely credited with having saved nissan motor co. from near-bankruptcy
he also serves as chairman and chief executive of frances renault and chairman of mitsubishi motors
brazilian-born , of lebanese descent and a french citizen , he is one of the few foreigners in such a senior position in japan
nissan said it conducted an internal investigation that lasted several months based on a report from a whistleblower regarding misconduct by ghosn and representative director greg kelly
it shared its findings with public prosecutors for their own investigation
ceo hiroto saikawa said during a news conference at the company headquarters in yokohama
saikawa said he would convene a meeting of the board on thursday to remove ghosn and kelly
nissan said its investigation showed numerous significant acts of misconduct , including underreporting ghosns compensation to the tokyo stock exchange to the tune of more than $ 40 million over five years
it also said he used investment funds for personal gain and misused company expenses
nissan said kelly was also deeply involved in the wrongdoing
renault shares tumbled nearly 10 percent in paris , while nissans german-listed securities fell by a similar amount
ghosn , 64 , began his career at tiremaker michelin in france in the late 1970s before moving on to renault in 1996
he joined nissan in 1999 after renault bought a controlling stake and became its ceo from 2001 until 2017 , engineering a similar turnaround there and earning the nickname le cost killer.
ghosn stepped down as nissan ceo last year but remained chairman of the company
he became a star in the business world in japan , appearing on magazine covers dressed in a kimono and even spawning a manga comic book on his life , although he also attracted more criticism for his high salary
ghosn was one of the first executives to champion electric cars , and he developed a range of low-cost cars for emerging markets
in june , renault shareholders approved ghosns $ 8.5 million compensation for 2017
he also received the equivalent of more than $ 10 million in his final year as nissan ceo
the scandal also raised eyebrows in france , where the french government is a major shareholder in renault
finance minister bruno le maire said monday that the government would not comment on the judicial investigation in japan but had already made inquiries with renault about the companys management structure
in a late-night news conference , saikawa , the nissan ceo , did little to hide his anger at ghosn for letting the company down
the concentration of power in one individual , as well as ghosns long reign at the automaking conglomerate , affected operations and could have been factors in allowing the misconduct to take place , he said
saikawa also spent considerable time expressing his deep regret over the bewilderment and anxiety that the news has caused employees and stakeholders
the news is the latest scandal to sully nissans brand
tim hubbard , assistant professor of management in the university of notre dames mendoza college of business , said ghosns arrest complicates an interconnected set of relationships among nissan , renault and mitsubishi
one of the puzzles was why ghosn , with all his wealth , might have wanted to defraud his own company , if the accusations are true
said carl tobias , a professor at the university of richmonds law school
but he said it was far from clear whether this would be the case in japan
