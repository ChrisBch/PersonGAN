tokyo the newly elected governor of the japanese island of okinawa said tokyos decision to press ahead with the construction of a new u.s. military base on tuesday is outrageous and disrespects local democracy
denny tamaki , the son of an okinawan woman and a u.s. marine whom he has never met , won a gubernatorial election last month on a platform of opposition to the construction of a new u.s. marine base on the island
he met japanese prime minister shinzo abe earlier this month , and told him that okinawans opposed the building of a base at henoko , in the northern part of the island
less than three weeks later , abes government issued an injunction allowing construction to proceed
the okinawa prefecture makes up just 0.6 percent of japans total land area , but hosts about half of the 54,000 u.s. troops stationed in the country , including many marines and the largest u.s. air force base in the asia-pacific region
locals say thats unfair , complaining about the noise of low-flying aircraft , the danger of accidents and the behavior of a small minority of u.s. service members
the u.s. military says the islands strategic location means the bases are vital to the defense of japan , as well as to keeping the peace in the entire east asian region , from taiwan and china to the korean peninsula and the philippines
last week , the okinawan assembly voted to hold a nonbinding referendum on the issue , and tamaki confirmed that the vote will occur within six months
provided the referendum attracted at least 25 percent of registered voters , he vowed to respect its outcome and carry the result to abe and to the u.s. government
the base in henoko is supposed to ease the burden on okinawa , by allowing another marine corps base at futenma , in a much more densely populated part of the island , to close
nearly half of the 19,000 marines in okinawa would be relocated to bases in australia , guam and hawaii
but many locals say that isnt good enough construction of a base , even in a less densely populated area , cements the u.s. militarys continued presence on their island , they say
in japans okinawa island , u.s. military bases take center stage in election
takeshi onaga , tamakis predecessor , who died in office in august , had been engaged in a long-running legal and administrative battle with the central government to prevent construction of the henoko base
shortly after his death , the prefecture carried on the fight by revoking a landfill permit for the area , again halting work at the site
tamaki said abe had told him that tokyos stance on the bases had not changed , but japans prime minister also indicated that he would like to reduce the burden on okinawa
nevertheless on tuesday , the central government issued an injunction allowing work on the base to resume almost immediately
tamaki expressed his strong indignation at that decision , which he described as completely wrong and ignoring public opinion in okinawa
he said he is not asking for all u.s. military personnel to leave okinawa , just for the island to take a fairer share of the burden for national defense
opponent of u.s. military bases wins okinawa gubernatorial election
ethnically different from the people who live on the main islands of japan , the people of okinawa have long felt looked down upon
after world war ii , the u.s. military continued to rule okinawa until 1972 , two decades after returning the rest of japan to self-rule
tamaki said his father had to leave okinawa before he was born , and had written to his mother after leaving
but she decided to stay in okinawa rather than join him in the united states , and burned all the letters and photographs he sent
tamaki said his views were shaped from having grown up near a u.s. base , and were not linked to his family background
he likes and respects american culture , he said , especially rock n roll , but said the long-running controversy over military bases in okinawa has undermined the u.s.-japan alliance
i think we are standing at the crossroads.
