beijing defense secretary jim mattis held talks with chinese officials on wednesday , marking the first face-to-face encounter between leaders of the countries militaries since the united states declared beijing to be a primary challenge to american security
speaking alongside president xi jinping at the great hall of the people , mattis sought to telegraph american objectives in asia in hopes of defusing mounting tensions over issues including taiwan , chinas buildup in the south china sea and president trumps trade policy
the visit comes as positions harden among u.s. republicans and democrats against china , whose investments in advanced military hardware and sophisticated technology now threaten the united states decades of global military superiority
said abigail grace , a former white house official now at the center for a new american security
during his nearly 48-hour visit , mattis also met with defense minister general wei fenghe and yang jiechi , a senior foreign policy adviser to the president
u.s. officials said the talks included passing reference to the trade war brewing with china , as new u.s. tariffs are poised to take effect and beijing promises to strike back at the u.s. economy
but the goal of the talks , they said , was to convey u.s. interests in asia so the two countries can avoid escalating friction akin to what followed the collision of a u.s. spy plane with a chinese jet in 2001
dana white , chief pentagon spokeswoman , said the talks touched on issues including washingtons condemnation of the placement of chinese military assets in areas of the south china sea also claimed by u.s. allies in the region
she said , adding other areas of disagreement were also identified but not necessarily dwelled on.
u.s. officials have stressed their hope to expand emerging u.s.-chinese military cooperation and , more urgently , broaden communications channels that might prevent conflicts when the two militaries unexpectedly come into contact in the air or at sea
moreover , the two countries often fail to get beyond repeating their respective positions during dialogues , said michael kovrig , an analyst at the international crisis group
the chinese government appeared to take umbrage at the characterization of it as a revisionist power threatening the united states , laid out in a national defense strategy unveiled by mattis earlier this year
the defense official said , speaking on the condition of anonymity to characterize sensitive discussions
china has also opened its first overseas base , in the east african nation of djibouti , and invested in its cyberwarfare ability
the pentagon will use a share of what it expects will be a substantial boost in defense spending over coming years to counter the challenge from china and russia , another nation it has labeled a revisionist power
