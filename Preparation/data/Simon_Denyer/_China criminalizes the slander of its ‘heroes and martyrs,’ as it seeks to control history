beijing chinas communist party has always understood the importance of policing its history
on friday , it tightened the screws further with a new law banning the slander of heroes and martyrs figures drawn from wartime propaganda said to have given their lives in defense of the communist party or the nation
chinese schoolchildren are taught about the heroic deeds of figures who fought against the japanese during world war ii , or who gave their lives for the communist party in the civil war with the nationalists
memorials to some of the most famous dot the country
now , it will be illegal to suggest that those tales might not be wholly factual
the law is part of a much broader and long-standing attempt by the communist party to mold or rewrite history in its interests
it has obfuscated the causes and extent of the famine that killed tens of millions of people during the disastrous great leap forward that began in 1958 , as well as the chaos of the cultural revolution that followed
it has made a determined attempt to erase from history the 1989 pro-democracy movement and the subsequent deaths of many demonstrators
yue zhongming , a member of the standing committee , said at a news conference that although the law is not intended to restrict academic freedom , it does not give permission to harm the honor of the nations heroes
zhang , for his part , maintained that the law was largely meant to emphasize and protect the legitimacy of the communist party and to tie up the idea of loving the country with loving the party.
chinas all-powerful leader should heed the lessons of history , says former official
the law was first submitted for deliberation in december , with its final draft expanded to include a provision to punish people who glorify acts of war or invasion.
state media said that provision referred to a handful of chinese who have taken to dressing up in japanese world war ii army uniforms and photographing themselves at famous wartime sites or memorials
the so-called spiritually japanese movement is thought to comprise a small group of people fascinated with that countrys war-era militarism , a group that foreign minister wang yi referred to as scum at a recent news conference
but the laws genesis lies in the protection of the communist partys version of history , experts say
state news agency xinhua wrote
rather than surrender
the pressure to sanitize history has intensified under president xi jinping , who has repeatedly warned about what he calls historical nihilism , a term that essentially means any attempt to question the communist partys glorious account of its own past
perry link , chancellorial chair at the university of california at riverside and emeritus professor of east asian studies at princeton university , said the laws main aim is to protect the communist partys version of history
