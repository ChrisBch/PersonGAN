tokyo the former leader of a doomsday cult that carried out a deadly nerve gas attack on the tokyo subway in 1995 was executed on friday , japanese media reported
six other cult members were also hanged in detention centers across japan
shoko asahara was the leader of the aum shinrikyo or aum supreme truth cult that was responsible for releasing sarin gas on five tokyo subway trains during the rush hour in 1995 , killing 13 people and poisoning more than 6,000 others
he was sentenced to death in 2004 , one of 13 cult members who ended up on death row and the first to be executed
asahara , 63 , a partially blind former yoga instructor , believed that the united states would attack japan with nuclear weapons and that only cult members would survive world war iii
he mixed buddhist and hindu beliefs with apocalyptic christian prophecies , variously declaring himself to be an incarnation of shiva , the hindu god of destruction and recreation , as well as christ and the first enlightened being since buddha
at its peak , aum had tens of thousands of followers , mostly in japan and russia
sarin is a deadly nerve gas originally developed by the nazis
asahara was convicted of ordering both sarin gas attacks , and also of ordering cult members to kill a lawyer who had been helping parents free their children from the cults clutches
the lawyer , 33-year-old tsutsumi sakamoto , was strangled in his home in 1989 , along with his wife and 1-year-old son
cult members used sharp umbrellas to puncture plastic bags filled with liquid sarin in crowded trains
experts said the death toll could have been much higher if the group had been better chemists and produced a purer form of the compound
aum evolved from a yoga school began by asahara in 1984 , and gained many followers from japans elite universities , attracted by his promise of a meaningful life free from the pressures of modern japan
but it gradually became increasingly paranoid and violent
in 2016 , russian police raided dozens of properties occupied by suspected cult members , and montenegro expelled 58 foreigners also believed to be followers of aum shinrikyo , the bbc reported
prosecutors said the tokyo attacks were carried out in revenge for the failure of asahara and 24 followers to win elections for japans house of representatives in 2000 , kyodo reported
asahara , whose real name is chizuo matsumoto , pleaded not guilty and never testified , remaining silent or muttering incomprehensibly during the eight years of his trial
the sentence was upheld by the supreme court in 2006 , and the executions followed the failure of a final appeal on behalf of one of the cult members in january
but amnesty international , which opposes the death penalty in all circumstances , said the executions had failed to deliver justice
said hiroka shoji , east asia researcher at amnesty international
