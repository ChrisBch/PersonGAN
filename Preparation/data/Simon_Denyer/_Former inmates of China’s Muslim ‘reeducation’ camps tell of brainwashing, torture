beijing kayrat samarkand says his only crime was being a muslim who had visited neighboring kazakhstan
on that basis alone , he was detained by police , aggressively interrogated for three days , then dispatched in november to a reeducation camp in chinas western province of xinjiang for three months
there , he faced seemingly endless brainwashing and humiliation , he said in an interview , and was forced to study communist propaganda for hours every day and chant slogans giving thanks and wishing long life to president xi jinping
further disobedience would result in waterboarding or long periods strapped in agony in a metal contraption known as a tiger chair , samarkand said , a punishment he said he suffered
zenz is a leading authority on the current crackdown in xinjiang
in a region of 21 million people , including 11 million muslims , the number of those he reports to be detained would be a significant proportion of the population , especially of young adult men
emerging accounts of the conditions in these camps make for chilling reading
zenz wrote , referring to the chaos unleashed by mao zedong in the 1960s
long beards and veils have been banned , and overt expression of religious sentiment is likely to cause immediate suspicion
there , they carry out political indoctrination and report back on anything from the extent of religious beliefs to uncleanliness and alcoholism
but reeducation camps that appear to have opened all across the region have sparked the greatest global concern
samarkand said 5,700 people were detained in just one camp in the village of karamagay , almost all ethnic kazakhs and uighurs , and not a single person from chinas han majority ethnic group
about 200 were suspected of being religious extremists , he said , but others had been abroad for work or university , received phone calls from abroad , or simply had been seen worshiping at a mosque
the 30-year-old stayed in a dormitory with 14 other men
inmates would sing communist songs , chant long live xi jinping and do military-style training in the afternoon before writing accounts of their day , he said
his account was corroborated by omir bekali , an ethnic kazakh who was working in a tourism company in urumqi , xinjiangs capital , until he was arrested by police on a visit to see his parents in the village of shanshan in march 2017
four days of interrogation , during which he was prevented from sleeping , were followed by seven months in a police cell and 20 days in a reeducation camp in the city of karamay , he said
he was given no trial , he said , nor was he granted access to a lawyer
bekali described a day that would begin with a flag-raising ceremony at 6:30 a.m. , followed by a rendition of one or more red songs praising the communist revolution
after breakfast , inmates would spend 10 minutes thanking the communist party and xi for providing everything for the people , from food and drink to their livelihoods
inmates had to learn the national anthem and red songs , he said , as well as slogans condemning the three evil forces of separatism , extremism and terrorism
some inmates committed suicide , bekali said
both men said the food was poor , with meat infrequent and food poisoning not uncommon
inmates sometimes were forced to eat pork , forbidden in islam , as punishment , while bekali said those accused of being religious extremists also were forced to drink alcohol
bekali , 42 , had emigrated to kazakhstan in 2006 and become a kazakh citizen , and he said the kazakh government eventually won his release
samarkand said he was allowed to leave for kazakhstan to join his wife and children after the government confiscated his house and savings , worth about $ 190,000
he was given 500 yuan , equivalent to $ 80 , by police at the border as he departed
both men , interviewed by phone , are now in kazakhstan
he dates the onset of widespread detentions to march 2017 and a government campaign of de-extremification through education
that followed the appointment of chen quanguo as party secretary in xinjiang in august 2016 and his transfer from tibet , where he oversaw a similar program of intense social control , surveillance and securitization
zenz wrote in the report , first published by the jamestown foundation
bekali said he met doctors , lawyers and teachers in the camps , while radio free asia ( rfa ) has reported that wealthy business executives , 80-year-olds and breast-feeding mothers have been among the detainees
one of the best-known detainees is a uighur soccer player , erfan hezim , 19 , a former member of chinas youth soccer team and now a forward for chinese super league team jiangsu suning
also detained have been dozens of family members of journalists from the washington-based rfa , who have been at the forefront of reporting on the deepening crackdown in xinjiang and the reeducation camps
at least two of the affected reporters , both naturalized u.s. citizens , have reason to believe their family members were detained specifically because of their reporting , rfa said
in one report , rfa quoted a chinese official as justifying the widespread detentions in blunt terms
