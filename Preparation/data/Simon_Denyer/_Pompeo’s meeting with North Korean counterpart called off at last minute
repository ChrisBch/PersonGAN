tokyo the state department on wednesday announced a planned meeting with a top north korean envoy had been scrubbed , even as president trump said he hoped to hold a second summit with kim jong un early next year.
trump told reporters at the white house that pompeos meeting is going to be rescheduled , but gave no further specifics on why the talks were called off
last week , north korea repeated its demand that washington lift sanctions as part of a step-by-step approach toward dismantling the norths nuclear program
but trump said sanctions relief first required concessions on the part of pyongyang
pompeos meeting was scheduled for thursday
state department spokeswoman heather nauert said it would now take place at a later date.
south korean national broadcaster kbs reported that the north korean negotiating team , led by kim yong chol , was supposed to fly wednesday from beijing to new york
but kbs said it was unclear whether the team had even arrived in beijing
it added that kim yong chol apparently had canceled his new york flight early tuesday
one person familiar with the situation said kim yong chol may have wanted to parlay his meeting with pompeo into a visit with trump , but canceled the visit after being told trump would be flying to paris on friday and unavailable for a meeting
north korea threatens to restart nuclear program unless u.s. lifts sanctions
the postponement comes at a tricky time in the nuclear negotiations
north korea wants both sides to take simultaneous and phased steps , with its concessions matched by similar steps from washington , to reassure the north korean leader he can safely scale back or dismantle his nuclear weapons program
the united states takes a fundamentally different approach , demanding north korea fully denuclearize before sanctions are lifted
in the past few weeks , the two sides appear to have grown further apart
north korea has increased its demands it had been asking the united states to formally declare an end to the 1950-53 korean war , but now it is arguing it needs sanctions relief before it takes any further steps
on friday , a commentary published by the head of a north korean foreign ministry think tank warned pyongyang might even restart its nuclear weapons program if sanctions are not lifted
said harry kazianis , an asia expert at the center for the national interest
at the same time , south korean government advisers and experts say pyongyang is not prepared to hand over a list of its nuclear and missile facilities , believing such a document would effectively give the u.s. military a list of potential targets
if these disputes are behind the postponement of the meeting , it would not be the first time the negotiations have run into trouble
in may , trump announced a planned summit with kim jong un had been canceled , citing hostile statements from pyongyang
but soon afterward , as a result of mediation by south korean president moon jae-in , kim yong chol flew to the united states to meet pompeo and deliver a letter to trump that paved the way for the june summit
in august , a planned trip by pompeo to pyongyang was canceled when negotiations hit an impasse
the secretary of state eventually made the trip last month
kim eui-keum , a spokesman for south koreas presidential blue house , advised against reading too much into the latest setback
south koreas foreign ministry also told reporters not to overthink the postponement or fixate on every turn.
but it acknowledged disappointment and said it hopes the talks will be rescheduled soon
an official told local reporters in a background briefing
despite seouls largely upbeat tone , the rift does seem significant and has even strained relations between washington and seoul , with south korea backing north koreas call for sanctions relief
many experts doubt pyongyangs willingness to surrender its nuclear weapons and think it has been stringing trump along to gain whatever concessions it can
but some argue the u.s. foreign policy establishment is locked into a too-rigid mind-set
