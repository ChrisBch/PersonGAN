tokyo a japanese office worker was charged , butted and bitten by a wild boar while on his way to his local train station
the incident was caught on a video that has since gone viral
japanese media said the 48-year-old salaryman was walking to imajuku station in the suburbs of the city of fukuoka at 7 a.m. on oct. 26 when the boar suddenly charged him from an alley
the video , posted on twitter by koki915n , has been viewed more than 3 million times
local media said the train station is about half a mile from the mountains and the boar is believed to have wandered into town from the foothills
after running into a dead end between a pharmacy and a chain-link fence , the animal made a dash for freedom , upending the commuter , before biting him , goring him with its tusks and even going after his briefcase
two passing cars honked their horns in hopes of frightening the animal away
the man was taken to a hospital , where he was treated for wounds on both legs , including a gash on his left thigh that needed eight stitches and one on his right knee that needed five stitches , the daily mainichi shimbun reported
the boar was spotted later that day near the coast and killed by members of a local hunting club
only days after that attack , a man on a motorbike collided with a boar at night at kyushu university in fukuoka , breaking bones in four fingers
fukuoka prefecture suffers considerable crop damage due to wild boars
the local government is working with area hunters to cull 1,500 boars a year , but it usually falls short of that target because of budget restrictions and a lack of hunters
but when japanese media reported that two boars had fallen into a dry reservoir in kitakyushu in the same prefecture last month , the local government was surprised to be inundated with hundreds of calls asking for them to be rescued rather than killed
the boars were rescued and released back into the wild
