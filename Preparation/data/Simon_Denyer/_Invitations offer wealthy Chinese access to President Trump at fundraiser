the letter , circulated to dozens of wealthy entrepreneurs in china last week , looked official
the invitation , which republican party officials say they had nothing to do with , was not the only such offer
at least two other china-based companies circulated similar solicitations in the past week , offering access to trump at an official fundraiser in dallas on may 31 , and charging two or three times the price of a ticket
while u.s. election law prohibits campaign contributions from anyone but u.s. citizens and permanent residents , foreign visitors may attend fundraisers as long as they do not pay their own entry
but some campaign finance experts say there would be ethical concerns if foreigners were routinely gaining access to the u.s. president through fundraisers
and the solicitations , if offering a legitimate service , raise questions about whether attendees are indirectly paying for their tickets through a u.s. donor , which would be illegal
republican party officials confirmed the presence of chinese nationals at the december fundraiser but said they knew nothing about the dallas solicitations
after being contacted by the post , they referred the invitations to federal authorities
mica mosbacher , a member of the trump 2020 national advisory board and a gop fundraiser in texas , said the board had no knowledge of the solicitations to the dallas event and would not endorse this activity.
the official said
every guest at an rnc event where the president or vice president is present must go through a rigorous vetting process with the secret service , the official said
the fundraiser in dallas next week is set to take place at a very sensitive time in the white houses trade talks with china
just two days after the event , commerce secretary wilbur ross will be in china meeting with senior officials about boosting u.s. imports
chinese officials have already made clear that they are trying to extract concessions from the white house in exchange for any agreement , making the talks very fluid
business groups in both countries could stand to win or lose billions of dollars based on the outcome of the talks
sun changchun , who described himself as the head of a chinese cultural exchange company , is promoting the dallas event on wechat , a chinese messaging service
he claimed to have arranged both the dallas and new york trips
he told the post that he planned to give the dallas ticket proceeds to the rnc , but provided no evidence to substantiate that assertion or any relationship with the rnc
his understanding , he said , was that the rnc would in turn donate the money to charity
suns invite claims that he and his associates have prior experience participating in three republican president dinners in 2017 , including the new york visit
the post could not independently verify his involvement in any trips
in the interview , he said his beijing-based company aims to raise the profile of chinese entrepreneurs
the $ 100,000 per-person price tag includes airport pickup , lodging , meals and translator , the invitation says
one of the influential chinese guests who attended the december event was li xiaohua , the ferrari owner and chairman of huada international investment group , according to chinese media reports , which published photos of him with trump
at least three other chinese visitors attended rnc events that day , and one was photographed with rnc chairwoman ronna mcdaniel and white house counselor kellyanne conway , chinese media reports said
the post contacted several chinese guests whose u.s. trips sun claims to have facilitated , including li , but none agreed to an interview
the solicitations follow a history of campaign finance controversies involving foreign money and u.s. elections , notably under the clinton administration
before the 1996 presidential election , federal authorities found , the chinese attempted to direct foreign contributions to the democratic national committee and later to president bill clintons legal defense fund
a longtime fundraiser for vice president al gore was convicted in 2000 for her role in arranging more than $ 100,000 in illegal donations to the dnc
among the issues being examined by special counsel robert s. mueller iii in the russia investigation is whether foreign money flowed into u.s. political campaigns
the legal access that foreigners have to u.s. political fundraisers has long worried some campaign ethics experts
in addition to the invitation crafted to appear as though it was sponsored by the republican party , a different solicitation carried the logo of the china construction bank , one of chinas largest state-owned banks
that invite claimed representatives from zte corp. would attend the event , according to a copy obtained by the post
this month , trump announced via twitter that his administration would be taking steps to prevent the chinese telecommunications company from going out of business because of new trade restrictions
andrew elliott , vice president of strategic marketing for zte usa , said in an email
the invite purported to offer a photo opportunity with trump and a ticket to the dinner for $ 150,000 three times the amount charged by the rnc
the invite read
officials with ccbs shenzhen branch released a statement saying it had investigated reports of the invite and found that some employees were involved.
our branch did not participate in organization , the statement said
bank officials found that the invitation was organized by a group registered in hong kong called the chinese commercial counsellor and entrepreneurship association and the shanghai vvisa tourism service co. , a chinese tourism service
