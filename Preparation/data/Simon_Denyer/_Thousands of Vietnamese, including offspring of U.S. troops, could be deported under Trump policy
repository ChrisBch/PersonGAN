robert huynh is the son of an american serviceman , although he never knew his father
his mother is vietnamese , and he was conceived during the vietnam war
in 1984 , nine years after the last american troops left the country , 14-year-old huynh moved to louisville with his mother , half brother and half sisters under a u.s. government program to bring amerasians and others to the united states
today , at 48 , with a son and two young grandsons in kentucky , he faces the prospect of being sent back to vietnam , a country he has not visited since he left and where he has no relatives or friends
huynh is one of about 8,000 vietnamese potentially caught up in a tough new immigration policy adopted by the trump administration , significantly escalating deportation proceedings against immigrants who have green cards but never became u.s. citizens and have violated u.s. law
huynh , who helps out these days in his familys nail salons , has several criminal convictions
he acknowledges that he made mistakes but says he accepted his punishments and tried to build a life here
now he risks losing it all
vietnamese immigrants are stuck in limbo , detained indefinitely , lawsuit says
nearly 1.3 million vietnamese citizens have immigrated to the united states since the communist takeover of south vietnam in 1975
many came in the wave of boat people who made headlines in the late 1970s as they fled vietnam in overcrowded and unsafe vessels
the new arrivals were given green cards when they reached the united states , but many huynh among them lacked the education , language skills or legal help needed to negotiate the complex bureaucratic process of obtaining citizenship
many came as children , attended schools and colleges in the united states , worked , paid taxes and raised families
decades later , their lives and families could be ripped apart again
now , the white house says , there is no such immunity to deportation for any noncitizen found guilty of a crime
critics of the shift accuse the administration of reneging on the 2008 agreement
the state department disputes that , citing a line in the agreement noting that both sides maintain their respective legal positions regarding the pre-1995 arrivals
the state department said in a statement , declining to respond on the record specifically on the issue of vietnam
the trump administrations view is that the 2008 agreement was not aimed at protecting a certain population of immigrants from political persecution if they were returned to vietnam
opponents of the new policy say the vietnamese in question were refugees from a communist regime and deserving of a haven in the united states
at least 57 people who arrived before 1995 were in ice detention in mid-june , according to figures that ice supplied to attorneys
an additional 11 have been sent back to vietnam , where they are certain to face suspicion from the security services for their perceived loyalty to the defunct south vietnamese state
several are struggling to obtain the identity cards they need to work or even drive , attorneys say
vietnam does not want them back , said former u.s. ambassador to vietnam ted osius , who was appointed by president barack obama
some committed violent crimes and have served their prison terms
others were convicted of various nonviolent crimes , including possession of marijuana , passing counterfeit money or driving under the influence , attorneys say
said phi nguyen , litigation director at the atlanta chapter of asian americans advancing justice , who has filed a class-action lawsuit in california requesting a stay on the detentions
huynh was served a deportation order after being released from prison in 2006 and was kept for four more months in immigration detention before the authorities acknowledged that vietnam would not take him back
in 2017 , after his conviction for running the unlicensed gambling operation , he was ordered to report to a probation officer every month
huynh was to spend another year in immigration detention
tung nguyen came to the united states in 1991 as a 13-year-old his parents had adopted an amerasian daughter , and the whole family was allowed to immigrate under the amerasian homecoming act
but with his parents working long hours in low-paid jobs just to put food on the table , he was often left alone and struggled to adapt
he said by telephone from santa ana , calif. that meant associating with vietnamese boys who were living a gangster-like existence , he said
in 1994 , when he was 16 , he was involved in a fatal stabbing , stemming from an argument over respect.
tung held a knife but didnt carry out the stabbing he was tried as an adult and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison
but after tung served 18 years , california gov
jerry brown ( d ) reviewed his case and released him on parole on the basis of exceptional rehabilitation.
tung has since dedicated himself to helping crime victims and offenders in the vietnamese american community and working for juvenile justice reform
in 2014 , he got married
this year , the open society foundations awarded him a soros justice fellowship , recognizing him as an outstanding individual working to improve the u.s. criminal justice system
this is my life this is my home.
former ambassador osius calls the new u.s. policy repulsive and racist
huynh finally reunited with the american side of his family in 2016 , after a dna test led him to a cousin who was trying to find his own father the younger brother of james a
falls , huynhs father
there was bad news and good news
huynh found out that the man he had wondered about all his life had died when huynh was just 4 , in a car accident in the united states in 1974
but he also found an older half brother and a half sister and his fathers two younger sisters , who live near him in houston.
both my aunties really love me , he said
he cant imagine leaving his entire family behind now
