seoul nearly 90 south korean families crossed the heavily fortified border into north korea on monday to be reunited with relatives they had not seen since being separated in the chaos of war nearly seven decades earlier
brothers , sisters , cousins , nephews and nieces cried and embraced each other in the first family reunions to take place in three years , a symbol of thawing ties across the korean peninsula
some relatives could not even recognize each other , but that was not a problem for 88-year-old kim byung-oh and his 81-year-old north korean sister kim soon ok , who were separated while still at school
kim byung-oh said as he met his sister , according to brief pool reports supplied by south korean reporters
kim soon ok showed her brother an old photograph of herself at medical school and said she had worked as a doctor.
i lead a respected life in pyongyang , she said
kim byung-oh said he had worked as a high school headmaster until retiring 10 years ago , adding that it was an honor to see his sister had done so well
after 11 hours together over the next three days , the pair will part , unlikely to see each other again
and unless something changes they will not even be able to exchange letters
he escaped north korea in the christmas miracle
at 88 , he wants to return
the reunion program began in 1985 , stalled , then got underway again at the turn of the millennium
in all , more than 17,000 south korean families have taken part in 20 reunions since then
a few thousand others have participated in a brief program of video linkups
of those still on the waiting list , more than 12,000 are over 90 years old
for many participants , these reunions represent the first news they have had of their relatives in nearly seven decades
south korean president moon jae-in told a meeting with presidential secretaries monday
moon is himself a member of a divided family his parents fled on a ship from the north korean port of hungnam in december 1950 , and he accompanied his mother to meet her younger sister during an earlier family reunion in 2004
he also appealed for families to be allowed to exchange letters
the south korean families , 89 applicants usually with two or three relatives accompanying them , were bused across the border on monday morning to the north korean resort of mount kumgang
many were war refugees who fled south during the war , leaving relatives behind
some crossed in wheelchairs pushed by relatives and red cross volunteers
the oldest was a 101-year-old man
as the meetings got underway monday , north korean sisters kim gyong sil and kim gyong yong waited nervously for their mother to arrive
the sisters , 72 and 71 , respectively , were dressed in violet hanboks , the korean traditional dress , and as their mother approached , they stood up , bowed and burst into tears
they cried loudly for several minutes , before finally settling into conversation
their mother , han shin-ja , 99 , did not let go of their hands the entire time they were talking
but the reunions are often also tinged with frustration , with many north koreans determined to publicly demonstrate their allegiance to the regime , out of genuine loyalty or just fear
in past reunions , some north koreans have even sung propaganda songs , something that can cast an understandable chill over the gatherings
indeed , south korean cha je-keun , 84 , soon got into an argument with his 50-year-old nephew , cha sung il , of north korea
agreeing that the two nations should be reunified , the younger man exclaimed american bastards should be expelled.
cha je-keun tried to explain that the korean war took place because north korean leader kim il sung invaded on june 25 , 1950
yeah , that was good , cha je-keun answered with a smile , ending the quarrel
after an initial two-hour meeting , the families sat down for dinner together , looking much closer and at ease with each other
the banquet featured a range of north korean delicacies , as well as state-brewed taedonggang beer and strong spirits
the families were seen clinking glasses and putting food on each other 's plates
in the last round of reunions in 2015 , kim hyun-sook met her north korean daughter and granddaughter but felt they could not speak freely in front of her
what they told me was shaped by the communist regime , the 90-year-old said
but she added that it was still an emotional , if bittersweet , moment
a second round of reunions involving an additional 83 families will take place from friday to sunday
while south korea chooses participants through a computerized lottery , experts say north korea selects candidates based on their perceived loyalty to the regime
