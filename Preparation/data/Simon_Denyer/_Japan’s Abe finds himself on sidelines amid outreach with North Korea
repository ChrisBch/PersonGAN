tokyo as north korean leader kim jong un works the diplomatic channels from seoul to washington , one asian leader finds himself out in the cold
japanese prime minister shinzo abe has repeatedly expressed his determination to meet kim and break the shell of mutual distrust.
so far there is nothing on the horizon
just the opposite , in fact
north koreas propaganda machine has gone easy on the united states this year
but it has stepped up its vilification of japan , sparing no opportunity to remind its citizens of koreas suffering under japanese colonial rule in the decades before world war ii
japan , north korean state media argues , is nothing less than heinous war criminal state , populated by island barbarians and led by a kingpin of corruption who has done only evil deeds since taking power
the question is whether all that bluster matters
after all , the north had blasted the united states with a similar propaganda barrage for decades
but the fast-moving events this year have highlighted japans outlier status as possible deals are cut and new relationships are formed
said koichi nakano , a political-science professor at tokyos sophia university
the japanese news media took a similar line this week , reacting coolly to the exultant mood at the summit between kim and south korean president moon jae-in
nikkei , an influential financial newspaper , painted a worst-case scenario in which north korea gives up its intercontinental ballistic missiles but retains the ones that can target japan
cooperation between japan , the united states and south korea is essential , a nikkei article said
japans abe finds himself out of step on north korea
last year , japan stood side by side with the united states in insisting on maximum pressure on north korea until the country surrenders its nuclear weapon program
today , maximum pressure has all but disintegrated , as china and russia ease their enforcement of sanctions and south korea talks eagerly about economic cooperation with the north
so , when japanese foreign minister taro kono warned recently that sanctions should not be lifted until north korea completely denuclearizes , pyongyang reacted with contempt
it mocked tokyo for trying to stand in the way of the trend of the times.
the norths official rodong sinmun newspaper wrote
north korea had built a regime of fear based on the idea that a u.s. invasion is imminent , and its television news takes every opportunity to remind viewers of the terrible atrocities it says were committed by the u.s. military during the korean war
that is , until kim prepared to meet with president trump in singapore in june
anti-american propaganda has largely vanished from state tv and news media , and trump is no longer described as mentally deranged or a dotard.
instead japan has assumed the mantle of public enemy no
trump and abe have bonded , but not over north korea strategies
partly thats because the regime needs a scapegoat for its own repressive rule , and japan is an easy target
it is also because pyongyang sees tokyo as an american puppet , not worth taking seriously at this stage in the negotiating process even if it wants japanese cash and investment further down the line , experts say
but there is another reason tokyo finds itself on the sidelines the abductions issue.
in the 1970s and 1980s , an unknown number of japanese citizens were kidnapped by north korean agents and taken to north korea , partly to teach spies about japanese language and culture
the issue has inflamed public opinion ever since and become a favorite cause for conservative japanese politicians , who still wear blue-ribbon lapel badges in solidarity with the affected families
and the man who championed that cause more than any other and who rose to political power partly on the back of it is abe himself
in 2002 , junichiro koizumi , then japans prime minister , traveled to pyongyang and managed to get five abductees released
japan says at least 12 more remain missing and rejects north koreas assertion that no more are left alive and that the case is closed
since 2002 , both sides have dug in their heels
to make matters worse , there is urgency
the father of one of the japanese missing megumi yokota , who was 13 when she was abducted is ill
her mother writes heartfelt letters to her long-lost daughter that are periodically published in the sankei shimbun newspaper
nevertheless , negotiations are likely to be going on behind the scenes , hughes said
the washington post reported on one secret meeting between japanese and north korean officials in vietnam in july
and experts dont rule out the possibility of progress
sheila smith , a senior fellow for japan studies at the council on foreign relations , notes that kim contacted abe in 2014 about the abductee issue
the initiative foundered but could potentially be revived , she said
hitoshi tanaka , who led secretive negotiations with pyongyang during the koizumi administration , said tokyo is unlikely to resolve the abductee issue straight off
instead , it needs to support u.s.-led efforts to get north korea to denuclearize , he said , and then arrange a credible investigation into the abductee issue as part of a broader deal that includes japanese investment and aid
in the meantime , abe finds himself in a tough spot
sophia universitys nakano argues that is largely his own fault
