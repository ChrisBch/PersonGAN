tokyo north korean leader kim jong un wants to hold a second summit with president trump soon to speed up the denuclearization process , south korean president moon jae-in said thursday
moon was speaking on his return to seoul after a three-day meeting with kim in pyongyang
the next possible moves by washington remain unclear
on wednesday , secretary of state mike pompeo said the united states was prepared to engage immediately with north korea to move dialogue ahead
moon said kim also wanted pompeo to come to north korea
moon told reporters
moon said kim also told him that the closure of a nuclear weapons test site at punggye-ri could be subject to international verification as well
he said he would discuss with trump his and kims goal of formally declaring an end to the korean war by the end of this year
moons optimism about engagement with kim contrasts with more cautious assessments among foreign observers of the regime
very few of these experts believe kim is willing to surrender his entire nuclear arsenal , although some think he might be prepared to reduce it in return for economic benefits and guarantees that his regime will not be threatened
u.s. intelligence officials , meanwhile , believe the kim regime has stepped up the production of nuclear fuel at several secret sites this year , according to an nbc news report in june
if true , that would seriously undermine the significance of the concessions kim is offering
north koreas kim offers to dismantle nuke site but only after u.s. acts
when asked what the corresponding measures would be , moon said that needs to be discussed between north korea and the united states
cheong seong-chang , a north korea expert at the sejong institute near seoul , said the announcement shows that kim has much more specific ideas now about denuclearization and what he wants in return
he added that the next summit should produce more specific results
the korean war ended in 1953 with an armistice rather than a peace treaty
north korea wants south korea and the united states to declare the war to be formally over , as a sign that hostilities have ended and to build trust
members of trumps administration are concerned that such a declaration could be used to undermine the justification for the presence of u.s. forces in south korea , politically if not legally
