beijing china said thursday that it will stick by its freeze-for-freeze proposal to de-escalate tensions on the korean peninsula , contradicting a suggestion by president trump that it had turned against the plan
the proposal calls for north korea to freeze its missile and nuclear tests in return for the united states and south korea suspending their annual joint military exercises
on wednesday , trump suggested chinese president xi jinping had acknowledged to him that the plan was a non-starter
but a spokesman for china 's foreign ministry said that beijing insisted that dialogue was the only solution , and that its proposal was still on the table
suspension-for-suspension is the most realistic , viable and reasonable solution in the current situation , geng shuang said at a regular news conference
i stress that it 's only the first step , not the end
and on thursday , white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders acknowledged that the two leaders had not agreed that the freeze proposal should be dropped
she suggested that trump and xi had agreed to disagree on the matter , effectively tabling it
yeah , both sides made their position clear , sanders said when asked about trump 's assertion and the chinese government 's response
they 're different
but we agree that they 're going to be different positions , and therefore it 's not going to move forward
the back-and-forth , coming just two days after the president 's return from his asia trip , highlights the lack of coherent policy put forward by the united states to actually usher north korea along the path of denuclearization
james acton , co-director of the nuclear policy program at the carnegie endowment for international peace , said the trump administration deserves credit for raising the profile and urgency of the issue , and for pushing china to impose stricter sanctions than in the past
one question is what would the preconditions be for the u.s. to sit down with north korea to negotiate , he said
we 've had at least three different answers to that question in the past week or two
trump claims his asia trip forged new unity against north korea
the proposal also lets china off the hook and plays into its attempts to portray the issue as solely a problem between headstrong governments in washington and pyongyang
experts say the risks of backtracking are also asymmetrical the united states might cancel its annual military exercises , but if north korea reneged on its side of the deal in subsequent weeks or months , those exercises would be very hard to reschedule
china is the main economic backer of the north korean regime , accounting for more than 80 percent of its official foreign trade
but his comments made while in asia lacked consistency
in seoul , trump told the north koreans that the path to a better future begins with a stop to your development of ballistic missiles , and complete , verifiable and total denuclearization
in tokyo , he said that if north korea returned japanese citizens whom it had abducted , that could be a tremendous signal and would be the start of something
nor does the united states appear to have a proposal to counter china 's freeze-for-freeze idea to de-escalate tensions , acton said
it is unrealistic , he said , to expect agreement on denuclearization in a first round of talks , so interim steps to build confidence are essential
if you accept that premise , then what kind of interim outcome are we going to accept where we give north korea some form of sanctions relief in return for it doing something down that path of denuclearization
he asked , adding that the united states does not appear to have an answer to that question
the whole purpose of sanctions is you lift them if the other side does what you want them to do , he added
the u.s. is very good at imposing sanctions it 's not so good at knowing the circumstances under which it will lift them
in tokyo , prime minister shinzo abe 's government said thursday that it was not aware of any agreement made by china to back away from the freeze-for-freeze proposal
however , the japanese government has been discussing a maximum pressure approach with the governments of south korea and china , said yoshihide suga , the chief cabinet secretary
suga , abe 's top aide , echoed trump 's assertion that his trip to asia was a tremendous success and credited the good start the american president got in japan
we believe that the u.s. handled the north korean issue in the following visits to south korea and china based on the accomplishments of the japan-u
s. summit , suga said
so we believe the president 's asia trip was extremely fruitful
on wednesday , china announced that it was sending a special envoy to north korea to brief pyongyang on its recently concluded communist party congress , and to talk about other issues of mutual concern , reopening a channel of communication to the isolated regime
but xie , of dragonomics , did n't see that as part of an effort to apply pressure on north korea
while in asia , she said , trump toned down his belligerent rhetoric and spoke in more measured tones about north korea , pledging for example to use all available tools short of military action
for washington that is hardly an ideal outcome , but on the positive side it means the tail risk of a war on the korean peninsula is receding
