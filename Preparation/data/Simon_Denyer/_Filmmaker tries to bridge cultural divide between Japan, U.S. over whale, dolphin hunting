tokyo megumi sasaki has lived in new york for 30 years
of all the issues she heard debated in that time , one issue stood out an issue on which she says she only ever heard one side of the argument , never the other side
the issue is the hunting of whales and dolphins
she said in an interview.
i have always wondered about that.
it is set in taiji , the small fishing village made infamous in the 2009 oscar-winning documentary the cove , where dolphins are seen being driven close to shore and slaughtered
that film , she said , was fantastic storytelling but full of prejudice.
sasakai said she spent six years making the film
in the end , she said , it was less about whale and dolphin hunting and more about communication
we just tend to impose our own righteousness on everyone
we dont listen to the other side
sasaki herself is not seen or really heard in the film
instead the central character is an american , jay alabaster , who has spent half his life in japan
he gives up his job with the associated press to live in taiji as a neutral but ends up winning the trust of and developing obvious affection for the tightknit whaling community that is deeply suspicious of outsiders
he says in the film
the film shows schoolchildren proud of the fact that their fathers and grandfathers were whalers it shows whale hunters keen to pass on their heritage to their children , determined not to be the generation that abandons the profession of their ancestors
but it also shows the western activists from sea shepherd and other groups who give up huge amounts of their time to come to a foreign country to try to protect animals they care deeply about
at one point , ric obarry , a former dolphin trainer turned activist who founded the dolphin project , is asked if he could imagine some middle ground between the two sides
obarry trained the five dolphins that were used in the popular television series flipper a show that helped give rise to the captive dolphin amusement park industry but he later concluded that the practice was cruel
the dolphin hunt in taiji captures many of the dolphins that are used in ocean parks around the world , and obarry says he will keep coming to taiji until they stop , or i drop.
in the film , a japanese journalist asks whether foreign pressure has actually been counterproductive and made japanese people more defensive about what they see as their culture
sasaki said her film received a good reception from the japanese public , even if some conservatives thought it was not strong enough in its defense of the whaling industry
in the united states , where she has been promoting it recently , it has encountered more opposition , including from louie psihoyos , who directed the cove.
in a facebook post , he said his team tried to get the mayor of taiji and the dolphin hunting union to present their side of the story , but they refused to speak
taijis annual whale and dolphin hunting season starts on sept. 1 and is marked by protests around the world
it runs until the end of february
activists say the number of dolphins killed or captured has been falling in recent years and numbered at least 720 last season
the townspeople say none of the species killed or captured are endangered
