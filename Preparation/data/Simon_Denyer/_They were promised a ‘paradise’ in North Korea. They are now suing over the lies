osaka , japan hiroko sakakibara was only a young girl when the north korean agents came to her fathers house trying to sell him on a dream of earthly paradise in the familys ancestral land
a socialist utopia awaits , they were told in the early 1960s
your every need work , home , clothes , health care will be guaranteed by the state
i told my father , lets go , lets go.
the ethnic koreans , known in japan as zainichi , were joined by a few thousand japanese spouses and children
instead , they say they encountered discrimination , desperate poverty and a complete denial of basic freedoms
now , four women and one man who spent decades in north korea before finally escaping to japan are pursuing legal action against the north korea government in a japanese court , seeking damages for the lies they were told and mistreatment they suffered
they are also demanding that their relatives be given the right to return to japan
japans abe finds himself on sidelines amid outreach to north korea
the fate of the zainichi is not a priority for the japanese government
it is fixated on the abductees , a much smaller number of japanese citizens who were kidnapped by north korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s
their stories have become something of a national obsession and a major obstacle to any rapprochement between tokyo and pyongyang
the lawsuit by the zainichi also cuts another way highlighting the cultural politics in japan and elsewhere in east asia that can relegate ethnic minorities to underclass status
sakakibaras parents , both ethnic koreans , found life a challenge in japan , she said
her father struggled to find regular work , and her mother had suffered a stroke
hiroko sakakibara now 68 remembers being shamed at school because she did not have lunch money
in may 1961 , the family boarded a soviet passenger vessel bound for the north korean port of chongjin
sakakibara vividly remembers the propaganda photos the family were shown before leaving japan beautiful girls plucking rosy apples off a tree , idyllic country scenes and modern cityscapes
opinion japanese abductee families to trump dont forget us
but once on board the ship , watched over by soviet soldiers , the doubts began to set in
the food was terrible , and the apples , they were so shriveled , she said
then , as the ship pulled into the port , they realized they had made a terrible mistake
what greeted them was a gray , impoverished and drab city , and a dock full of malnourished and shabbily dressed people , all the adults in the same dreary , dark gray clothes , some of the children without shoes or even trousers
around her , the adults had the same thoughts
they had been told they could live where they wanted , do whatever jobs they chose
it was a lie
many ended up in prison camps or coal mines , the families in the lawsuit claims
some died of malnutrition and disease , while others survived by selling what they had brought from japan and through money sent to them by relatives who had stayed behind
sakikibaras father was a construction worker in japan , but he was sent to work in the countryside and struggled to learn manual farming
unable to meet his quotas , he soon suffered a mental breakdown and was locked in a hospital for the mentally ill , where he died in 1964 , his daughter said
at school , she was continuously bullied because she had grown up in japan
in japan , the ethnic koreans were seen as politically suspect many were left-wing and a drain on the welfare state
the proselytizing campaign was carried out by the general association of korean residents in japan , or chongryon , a pro-north korea organization
the japanese red cross and the international committee of the red cross helped with arrangements
historical archives show japan knew what was happening
it told britain in the early 1960s that conditions for the immigrants were very hard , but still backed the campaign to send more back , said morris-suzuki
said kanae doi , japan director at human rights watch
sakakibara is grateful to japan for allowing her back
all she really wants now is an apology from the people who lured her and her family away
