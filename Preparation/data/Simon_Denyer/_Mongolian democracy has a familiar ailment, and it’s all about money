ulaanbaatar every post had its price
about $ 400,000 to become a cabinet minister , $ 120,000 to be the director of a government agency , $ 4,000 for a senior specialists role within the bureaucracy
more than 8,000 jobs in mongolias government and state-owned enterprises were being offered by the mongolian peoples party ( mpp ) if it won parliamentary elections , in return for the money the party needed to run its campaign
from the capital , ulaanbaatar , alone , party officials planned to raise 60 billion tugriks ( $ 25 million ) in campaign financing from business elites and foreign investors , according to audio recordings released by whistleblower ganbold dorjzodov between 2016 and 2017
with business controlling politics , voters feel alienated
there is a disillusionment with democracy that is familiar across the globe and that lies behind the rise of populist demagogues from asia to the americas
inspired by events in the soviet union and eastern europe , thousands of young mongolians demonstrated in 1989 and 1990 against the countrys authoritarian communist government , winning a peaceful transition to democracy that was initially greeted with tremendous enthusiasm and hope
in 1993 , turnout in the countrys first free presidential election was nearly 93 percent
in 2017 , that figure slipped to just over 68 percent , with nearly 19,000 people out of 1.4 million voters casting blank ballots to protest the quality of candidates on offer
the winning candidate , khaltmaa battulga , was a business tycoon and former wrestler who cast himself as an outsider a populist , anti-establishment figure
the man he defeated , miyegombo enkhbold of the mpp , was one of the politicians allegedly caught on the famous audio recordings
in india , severe restrictions on how political parties can raise money have driven campaign finance underground and fostered a culture of corruption and kickbacks , experts say
in the united states , the system is more transparent , but studies show that the need to raise money to finance election campaigns means business elites have vastly more influence over policy than average citizens
in mongolia , a law requiring political parties to report on their finances is simply ignored
and once businesses fund politicians , they expect something in return tenders for government contracts and licenses to mine are often sold for bribes or given away to those who have already paid , experts say
it is no coincidence that the proceeds from mongolias vast reserves of coal , copper and gold flow disproportionately to the elite , while nearly 30 percent of the country lives below the poverty line
luvsandendev sumati , director of the independent sant maral polling organization , says mongolians still demonstrate strong support for democratic ideals , such as that everyone should be equally treated by the law and have the right to express their opinions freely
but they are less impressed with the performance of their elected representatives
nearly 34 percent of respondents in sant marals latest poll said they believed that government policies mainly supported the rich , while a further 42 percent said policy was driven by self-interested politicians who lacked concern for society at large
more than 6 in 10 said voters had little or no influence on political decision-making , and 87 percent said political parties did not represent public opinion
cynicism also breeds short-termism
voters kick out incumbents at almost every opportunity , and many politicians make the most of their limited time in power to fill their pockets and those of their supporters
bureaucrats are replaced whenever power changes hands , so cronies rather than impartial experts fill many of the top jobs
the current president , battulga , wants to see the law changed so that no one involved in the mining business , which dominates mongolias economy , is allowed to get into politics
his immediate predecessor wanted to introduce a law demanding more transparency in party finances
but parliament is where the power lies in mongolian politics , and it isnt interested in passing laws that would threaten the two main parties cozy hold on power , experts say
true , mongolias anti-graft agency arrested two former prime ministers and a former finance minister in april over accusations of kickbacks during negotiations over a major copper mine
but the suspicion remains that corruption charges tend to be brought only after politicians lose power , not before
dorjzodov , the whistleblower , was working as chief strategy officer for an mpp-supporting businessman when he recorded audio of the campaign finance meeting on his ipad
the national institute of forensic science examined the recording and initially declared that it was genuine , but after the mpp won 2016 parliamentary elections it changed its mind and decided it was fabricated , dorjzodov says
mpp politicians in turn insisted that the audio had been spliced together , but independent expert analysis conducted in the united states concluded that it had not been tampered with
for the past two years , dorjzodov has been threatened by politicians , harassed by police , interrogated and detained by intelligence agents , and denounced in the media
even today , he cant find work
so , if he could relive the past , would he do it all over again
