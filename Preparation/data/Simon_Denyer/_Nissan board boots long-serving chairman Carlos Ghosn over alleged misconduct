tokyo nissan motors ended the reign of carlos ghosn on thursday , the board voting to remove him as chairman three days after his shock arrest for alleged financial misconduct
ghosn was the architect of nissans 19-year alliance with renault and helped turn both companies around during troubled times for the industry
renault has not removed ghosn as chairman and chief executive despite the accusations , and the arrest has laid bare strains within the alliance
ghosn had been pushing for a closer tie-up , possibly even a full merger , of nissan and renault , partly at the urging of the french government , which holds a 15 percent stake in the french automaker
but nissans management had serious doubts about the idea
saikawa had been appointed by ghosn as his successor , and french media compared him to brutus stabbing caesar in the back
japanese industry minister hiroshige seko and french finance minister bruno le maire spoke by telephone and stressed their desire to maintain an alliance they called one of the greatest symbols of franco-japanese industrial cooperation.
the pair met in person in paris on thursday
nissan announced monday that it had conducted a months-long investigation of ghosn after a tip from a whistleblower and found he had significantly underreported his earnings for years and spent company money for personal use
it said it had shared information with public prosecutors who had conducted their own investigation
ghosn and representative director greg kelly were taken into custody monday , and japanese media reported that prosecutors were given permission by a tokyo court on wednesday to extend their detention for a further 10 days
ghosn , a brazilian-born french citizen of lebanese descent , is being held at tokyo detention house , in a spartan cell far removed from his luxurious lifestyle , the nikkei newspaper reported
under japanese law , ghosn could face a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to 10 million yen ( $ 89,000 )
the french ambassador to japan , laurent pic , visited ghosn in detention tuesday , while lebanons government has expressed its concern that he receive a fair trial
japanese prosecutors have said little publicly , but japanese media have been full of anonymously sourced stories this week about ghosns alleged crimes
according to those accounts , ghosn used nissans money to secretly buy and maintain luxury homes in rio de janeiro , beirut , paris and amsterdam
the yomiuri newspaper also cited unnamed sources as alleging that ghosn had instructed that the equivalent of around $ 100,000 a year be paid to his elder sister for a nonexistent advisory role
ghosns record in turning around both car companies is widely acknowledged , but his pay packet had long been a source of controversy
it is possible ghosn was concealing his true remuneration to avoid the ire of shareholders , including the french government , experts say
