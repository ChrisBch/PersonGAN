taipei , taiwan as president trump battles it out with china over trade and the mood in washington sours toward beijing , there is a growing fear that taiwan will end up suffering the consequences
a sino-u.s. trade war could seriously damage taiwans export-oriented economy
more than half of its exports go to china , mostly parts and intermediate goods that are then assembled and exported to consumers in countries such as the united states
but the tectonic plates of international diplomacy are also moving in a way that could send shock waves through taiwan
ever since tsai ing-wen was elected president of taiwan in 2016 , beijing has signaled its displeasure with her stand-alone attitude
china has been stepping up its campaign to isolate taiwan internationally , while its military flexes its muscles
outright conflict , for now , remains unlikely , but the narrow taiwan strait is reemerging as one of asias most dangerous potential flash points , experts say
last month , trump signed the taiwan travel act into law , after unanimous votes in both houses of congress
recognizing taiwan as a beacon of democracy in asia , the act declares that it should be u.s. policy to send officials at all levels to taiwan and allow high-level taiwanese officials to visit their counterparts in washington
while some experts have played down the act as not legally binding , julian ku , a professor at hofstra universitys law school , said that underestimates its significance
he called it a statutory declaration of policy that the administration has an obligation to observe , even if there are no penalties for failing to do so
similar policy declarations , such as a 1998 vow to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq and the 1992 cuban democracy act , had significant impacts on foreign policy
after trump signed the act , chinas government lodged stern objections , warning washington of potentially serious damage to the foundations of their relationship
the nationalist global times newspaper recommended striking back by blacklisting from visits to the mainland any u.s. officials who travel to taipei , and even preparing for a possible direct military clash in the taiwan strait
the appointment of john bolton as national security adviser has also raised the stakes
either of those moves would be seen in beijing as firmly crossing a line
said margaret lewis , a professor at seton hall law school currently working in taiwan
trump , too , is a wild card
he spoke to tsai on the phone last year and approved a $ 1.4 billion arms sales package , but has also talked of taiwan as a potential bargaining chip in the broader contest with beijing
he has veered between buddying up to chinas president xi jinping and attacking beijing over trade
the backdrop is a rise in tensions between taipei and beijing since the 2016 election of tsai
her party sees taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation , and although she has ruled out any declaration of independence from china , she has declined to endorse the idea that there is one china.
china has responded by restricting the flow of mainland tourists to the island
it has poached two of taiwans few diplomatic allies , put pressure on global corporations to list taiwan as a province of china on their websites , and managed to exclude it from international bodies coordinating global health policy and civil aviation
it has also stepped up sorties by fighter jets and bombers around the island , and sent its sole aircraft carrier through the taiwan strait , most recently last month
xi , meanwhile , has dialed up the nationalist rhetoric , warning in a speech to the national peoples congress last month that any attempt to split china would be met by the punishment of history.
but could china try to force the issue before then
five years ago , xi declared that the problem of the china-taiwan divide can not be passed from generation to generation.
with the removal of term limits on his presidency , experts believe he now sees reunification as part of his legacy , preferably peacefully
said jason hsu , a legislator with the opposition kuomintang
ian easton , a fellow at the project 2049 institute and author of the chinese invasion threat , said taiwan remains in a strong position to repel a potential invasion , partly because of its forbidding island geography
but that conclusion may not stand indefinitely , especially as chinas defense spending rises by 8 percent a year while taiwans essentially stagnates , he said
in june , the american institute in taiwan , the de facto embassy there , will move its taipei office to a new location , with long-standing plans to invite a cabinet-level official to inaugurate it
that wouldnt be unprecedented environmental protection agency chief gina mccarthy visited in 2014
but this time , any such visitor could be viewed through the prism of the taiwan travel act and amid worsening sino-u.s. relations as a potential provocation
taiwans government wants strong and steady support from washington , including more visitors , more regular arms sales , firmer backing to prevent its exclusion from international bodies , and ultimately a free-trade agreement with the united states
but no one here wants sudden moves from washington that could provoke beijing to lash out
neither trump nor xi wants conflict over taiwan both have more pressing problems to deal with , not least north koreas nuclear weapons
but if each leader surrounds himself with yes-men , the risks of miscalculation rise
