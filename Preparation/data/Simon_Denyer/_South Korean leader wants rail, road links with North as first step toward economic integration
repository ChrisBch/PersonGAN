he also said he wants to see groundbreaking ceremonies before the end of this year to establish road and rail links between the two koreas , links that would cross what is one of the worlds most heavily militarized borders
that in turn could pave the way for an east asian railroad community , encompassing six northeast asian countries and the united states , he said
although he did not specify the countries , it is likely to mean both koreas , china , russia , japan and mongolia
moon compared this initiative to the gradually expanding ties that europe instituted after world war ii , starting with a six-nation coal and steel community and eventually culminating in the european union
