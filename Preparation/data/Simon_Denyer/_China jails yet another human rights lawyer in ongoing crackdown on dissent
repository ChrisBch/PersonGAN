beijing a chinese court tuesday convicted a prominent human rights lawyer of inciting subversion of state power , a vague charge often used to jail critics of the chinese communist party , and sentenced him to two years in prison
jiang tianyong , 46 , is the latest lawyer known for defending government critics to be jailed
more than 200 have been detained over the past two years in the ongoing crackdown on criticism in china
the court in the central chinese city of changsha said jiang tried to overthrow the socialist system by publishing articles on the internet , accepting interviews from overseas media outlets , smearing the government and overpublicizing certain cases
his defenders say his actions are all normal for his job as a lawyer
the trial and sentencing are seen by human rights experts as an attack on what remains of the country 's legal activist community and on liberal politics in general , as president xi jinping moves to bolsters the communist party and purge its critics
this case has been an absolute travesty from the beginning , sustained by nothing other than pure political persecution , not facts or broken laws , said sophie richardson , china director of human rights watch
by putting jiang tianyong behind bars , china does him , his family and itself irrevocable harm
jiang tianyong 's trial was a total sham , william nee , china researcher at amnesty international , said in a statement
even with the most rudimentary examination of the facts , the case against him crumbles , nee said
his so-called confession and apology , most likely extracted under duress , were nothing more than an act of political theater directed by the authorities
a broken lawyer , a hawkish judge cast a deep pall over chinas legal system
jiang is one of more than 200 lawyers , legal assistants and activists detained in what is known as the 709 crackdown for the day the purge started july 9 , 2015
some were released , but several leading lawyers have been charged with subversion , smeared in the party-controlled press and then subjected to what critics call political show trials , where they inevitably confess on camera to whatever charges they face
in recent weeks , chinese authorities stopped the child of another human rights lawyer who was targeted , wang yu , from traveling abroad to study
wang 's lawyer , li yuhan , was detained in october
jiang was known for his robust defense of those criticizing the chinese government
xie yanyi , a chinese rights lawyer , called jiang in a statement the soul of the 709 rescue effort for his determination to help colleagues in trouble
jiang spared no effort when it came to defending china 's most vulnerable groups , xie said
jiang disappeared into state custody in november 2016 as he traveled from beijing to changsha to advise another rights lawyer , xie yang , who had been detained
in january , xie 's attorneys published a transcript of their client describing the torture he allegedly endured in custody
but at his trial in may , xie denied his own account
three months later at his own trial , jiang told the court that he had helped xie invent the account
experts see the turnarounds in xie and jiang 's testimonies as further evidence that 709 lawyers are being tortured or otherwise coerced while in custody
at his august trial , jiang , looking defeated , confessed to the court and the cameras that he did everything prosecutors claimed and then meekly asked for mercy
under these circumstances , a fair trial is impossible
jiang 's wife , jin bianling , who lives in los angeles , has written to matt pottinger , an adviser to president trump , asking for help with her husband 's case
i am entreating you to save my husband , she wrote in a letter dated aug. 24
jin said she was able to briefly speak with jiang after the sentencing
she said she told him she will wait for him and that she hopes she will one day see him again
he said he misses us , she said
