u.s. officials said they doubt kim 's sincerity but declared that washington will not stand in the way , nor will it allow the north to drive a wedge between south korea and the united states
rocket man now wants to talk to south korea for first time , president trump tweeted , referring to kim
perhaps that is good news , perhaps not we will see
a top south korean official suggested that the two sides meet as early as next week
the offer of talks could lead to a temporary relaxation of tensions on the korean peninsula
but experts warned that north korea was most likely borrowing from a well-worn playbook , hoping to win relief from sanctions and buy time to improve its nuclear program without offering any real concessions
in a new year 's day speech , kim said he wanted to ease tensions with the south and was willing to send a delegation to the pyeongchang olympics , and suggested that the two sides meet to discuss the idea
at the same time , he cautioned the trump administration that a nuclear button was on his desk and his missiles could strike any part of the united states
trump responded with a threat of his own tuesday evening
will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that i too have a nuclear button , but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his , and my button works , he wrote on twitter
talks , if they took place , would be the first in more than two years
south korean president moon jae-in favors dialogue to reduce tensions with pyongyang and sees the olympics , which will begin feb. 9 , as a groundbreaking chance to improve ties and achieve peace
his government is also extremely keen to see the games go off successfully
some analysts cautioned that kim may be trying to split south korea from the united states , its ally
trump and moon have not been on the best of terms , and trump has attacked kim , personally and repeatedly
yet trump did not appear to be disconcerted by kim 's move
he said on twitter that sanctions and other pressure are beginning to have a big impact on north korea , citing the defection of two soldiers from the north across the demilitarized zone into the south in recent weeks
and while moon welcomed kim 's address , he stressed that seoul would have to coordinate the next steps with its allies , according to the yonhap news agency
at the state department , spokeswoman heather nauert told reporters tuesday that kim jong un may be trying to drive a wedge of some sort between the two nations , between our nation and the republic of korea
i can assure you that that will not happen
she said it is up to south korea if it wants to open talks with the north
but , she added , we are very skeptical of kim jong un 's sincerity in sitting down and having talks
kim said monday that he wanted to improve the frozen relations between the two koreas and would open our doors to anyone from the south who sincerely sought national concord and unity
we earnestly wish the olympic games a success , he said , according to the north 's official kcna news agency
from this point of view we are willing to dispatch our delegation and adopt other necessary measures with regard to this matter , the authorities of the north and the south may meet together soon
after moon asked his government to move as quickly as possible to bring north korea to the olympics , cho wasted no time in trying to pin down a date
we look forward to candidly discussing interests from both sides face to face with north korea , along with the north 's participation in the pyeongchang winter olympics , cho said
i repeat , the government is open to talking with north korea , regardless of time , location and form
talks could offer an opportunity to dial down tensions on the korean peninsula , after a year when war emerged as a real risk
but a sticking point has been a planned joint military exercise with the united states , which north korea sees as preparation for war
moon has asked washington for a postponement until after the olympics , but no agreement has been reached
daniel russel , who served as assistant secretary of state for east asia under president barack obama and is now a senior fellow at the asia society policy institute , said kim 's aim is to divide and conquer
kim wants to unwind sanctions and clearly sees president moon 's angst over the olympics as the weak link in the allied chain , he said
diplomacy is always the preferred option , and this opening should be explored carefully
but it would be naive to expect north korea to negotiate in good faith or consider itself bound by new agreements , given its past record
russel said the north korean leader 's behavior fit into a familiar pattern , with the threat of the nuclear button on kim 's desk combined with the enticement of talks
pyongyang 's pattern is to raise tensions to a fever pitch , dangle a conciliatory offer , collect any and all concessions , then rinse and repeat , he said
the key to disrupting this pattern and compelling north korea into credible negotiations over its nuclear program which is the goal of the sanctions is maintaining unity between the u.s. and south korea , as well as japan , china and russia
medeiros argued that north korea was trying to seek some sanctions relief as international pressure mounts and was playing for time as it works on improving its intercontinental ballistic missile program
it is far from clear what terms kim might try to attach to talks or what he would bring to the table , said jonathan pollack , a senior fellow at the brookings institution
is his government prepared , for example , to announce a suspension of nuclear and missile tests
because if they do n't , i do n't see any realistic possibility of any kind of discussion , and certainly not a negotiation with the north , he said
kim 's declaration monday that he had achieved his goal of creating a nuclear deterrent capable of reaching the united states could be the platform for such a suspension , experts say
the idea of north korea attending the winter olympics is also not one that meets universal approval
the international community was appalled by south africa 's apartheid regime and banned the country from participating in olympics , said bruce klingner , senior research fellow for northeast asia at the heritage foundation
but in response to north korea 's far more egregious human rights violations which the united nations has ruled to be 'crimes against humanity the world allows and even encourages north korea to participate
why the double standard
klingner said there is a long history of failed attempts to moderate north korean behavior by entreating pyongyang to participate in sporting and other cultural events
he recalled the 2000 sydney olympics , when the two koreas marched behind a single non-national flag in return for secret payments to the north and other concessions a symbolic gesture that failed to improve pyongyang 's behavior
yet with each new attempt there is breathless anticipation that this time will work , he said
sen. lindsey o. graham ( r-s.c. ) said the united states should boycott the olympics if north korea attends
allowing kim jong un 's north korea to participate in winterolympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet , he tweeted
i 'm confident south korea will reject this absurd overture and fully believe that if north korea goes to the winter olympics , we do not
