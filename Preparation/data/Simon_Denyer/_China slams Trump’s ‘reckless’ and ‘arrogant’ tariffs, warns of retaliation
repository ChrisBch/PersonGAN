trump threatened thursday to slap tariffs on up to $ 60 billion in chinese imports
china announced a more modest package of potential tariffs of its own and vowed to fight to the end to defend its interests if a trade war breaks out
tokyos main nikkei share index closed down 4.51 percent friday , while share indexes in shanghai and seoul fell by more than 3 percent , following similar drops in u.s. indexes thursday
china claimed that the slides back its stance
trump prepared to hit china with $ 60 billion in annual tariffs
that will almost certainly spell a further escalation of tensions
hours after trumps announcement , chinas commerce ministry gave the first indication of potential targets for retaliation , which it linked to trumps earlier move to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports
trump takes first steps toward imposing tariffs on chinese goods
arthur kroeber , managing director of gavekal dragonomics , said beijing is sending a carefully calibrated message that it will stand up to trump , while trying not to escalate the spat into a confrontation that could seriously threaten the global trading system
wei jianguo , a former vice commerce minister , said china has different lists of possible tariffs ready depending on trumps next move
he said china would target states and industries that are important to trump , such as autos , planes , it and semiconductors , wheat , corn and soybeans
but mei also recommended selling u.s. treasury bonds and undermining the u.s. stock market to make trump feel the pain.
not everyone believes the two nations are headed inexorably for a trade war
shen dingli , deputy dean of the institute of international affairs at shanghais fudan university , said the numbers announced so far were actually quite small compared with overall trade flows
last year , the united states imported $ 506 billion in goods from china and recorded a trade deficit of $ 375 billion
can trump win a trade war with china
shen said china knows that it has benefited in unfair ways from trade between the two nations and is prepared to open its markets further
he predicted tough talks ahead
but ni feng , deputy director of the institute of american studies at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , said there was no doubt the situation is deteriorating.
chinese president xi jinping sent two high-level envoys to washington last month , but neither managed to resolve the situation , he pointed out
indeed , u.s. officials say they have listened to chinese pledges to open up the countrys markets for too many years and are no longer interested in hearing empty promises
one senior official told reporters , speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak on the record
if a trade war does erupt , both sides are likely to share the blame
trump argues that previous u.s. presidents were far too soft on china
u.s. diplomats , business leaders and many experts , though , blame china for consistently failing to address long-standing demands to open its markets further
the american chamber of commerce in china said its members wanted the u.s. administration to advocate more strongly for a level playing field and reciprocal treatment to improve market access despite concerns that the current actions could disrupt the global economy
can trumps tariffs keep china from becoming the worlds technology leader
if there is a trade war , the first shots were fired by china many years ago , u.s. officials say , and it is beijing that has long gamed the rules of the world trade organization for its own benefit
the senior u.s. official said
others said china has misjudged how determined the trump administration is to resolve some of these issues and is mistaken now if it underestimates washingtons resolve
tweeted ely ratner , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations who served as deputy national security adviser to vice president joe biden
now the u.s. administration appears to be taking aim at the entire structure of the chinese economy , with its huge state-owned companies and state-backed attempts to corner key technologies of the future
for some in china , that sends a worrying message
meanwhile , japan so far has been excluded from the list of countries that have won exemptions from the u.s. steel and aluminum tariffs , which went into effect friday , despite being a key american ally in asia
trade minister hiroshige seko called that extremely regrettable and said tokyo would continue to push patiently to be exempted from the tariffs , news agencies reported
