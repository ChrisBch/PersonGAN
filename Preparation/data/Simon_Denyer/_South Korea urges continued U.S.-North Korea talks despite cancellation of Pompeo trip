tokyo south koreas foreign ministry on saturday urged washington and pyongyang not to walk away from the negotiating table despite the unexpected cancellation of u.s. secretary of state mike pompeos planned trip to north korea
president trump called off pompeos visit friday , days before the secretary was due to arrive in pyongyang , citing insufficient progress in the denuclearization of the korean peninsula
the abrupt shift in trumps public position appeared to surprise many people in asia but did not come as a complete shock many observers had sensed that negotiations between the two sides had stalled
trump calls off pompeos north korea visit , citing a lack of progress on denuclearization
north korea did not immediately react to the announcement
but south korea sought to play down concerns
south korean foreign minister kang kyung-wha spoke to pompeo by telephone saturday and expressed regret over the cancellation of the trip while calling for continued talks on peace and north koreas nuclear program , according to the ministry
the ministry said in a statement
japanese foreign minister taro kono expressed appreciation for pompeos prompt communication of the decision by telephone and said the two countries would continue to work together to take specific actions to achieve the denuclearization of the korean peninsula
from china , though , there was pushback
in a statement released saturday , foreign ministry spokesman lu kang blasted trump for his remarks , saying they showed a total disregard of the facts
china 's position on the korean peninsula nuclear issue is consistent and clear , the statement said
we are committed to achieving denuclearization on the korean peninsula
kang said china is making unremitting efforts to abide by the u.n. security council 's resolutions , and urged all parties to stick to the direction of seeking a political settlement
... secretary pompeo looks forward to going to north korea in the near future , most likely after our trading relationship with china is resolved
in the meantime i would like to send my warmest regards and respect to chairman kim
i look forward to seeing him soon
experts have said that china continues to broadly enact u.n. security council sanctions against north korea but has eased up on enforcement at the border in recent months
china also has been allowing more chinese tourists to visit north korea this year , as relations between the two countries have improved significantly
but chung min lee , a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , said that china is not responsible for the impasse between the united states and north korea
trump overplayed the gains from his singapore summit with north korean leader kim jong un and needed someone else to blame , lee said
only now does trump realize that north korea did not intend to give up its nuclear weapons , at least not as soon as he wanted , lee said
north korea has not taken steps to denuclearize , john bolton says
trump is , however , right in one sense , experts said
his trade war with china has caused considerable anger in beijing and makes it unlikely that the government there could be persuaded to cooperate if the united states wants to return to exerting maximum pressure on north koreas economy
cheong seong-chang , a north korea expert at the sejong institute , a government-affiliated think tank in seoul , said trump has the will to resolve the north korea situation but lacks a coherent strategy
cheong said the cancellation of pompeos visit put the ball in the court of south korean president moon jae-in , who is due to visit pyongyang in september and could play a role in facilitating negotiations between washington and pyongyang
but it could also strengthen chinas hand , with president xi jinping widely expected to attend pyongyangs sept. 9 celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the founding of north korea
park jie-won , a former special envoy of former south korean president kim dae-jung who has met north korean leader kim jong un and his late father , kim jong il , also warned trump not to walk away from dialogue
he posted on his facebook page saturday
