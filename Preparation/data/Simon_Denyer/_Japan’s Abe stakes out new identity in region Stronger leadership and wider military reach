tokyo japanese prime minister shinzo abe stood before african leaders in nairobi two years ago and outlined his vision for a vast stretch of the globe from the pacific to the indian oceans united by trade and a common political worldview
it was also a statement on the broader ambitions of japan , which has watched china dethrone it as asias top economic powerhouse
japan is now thinking bigger and with more confidence challenging the rise of china and trying to adapt to greater isolationism by the trump administration
earlier this month , japans indo-pacific plan was backed by leaders across southeast asias mekong river region
the pact was bolstered by a promise of investment in quality infrastructure that is financially and environmentally sustainable and backed by greater visibility for japans warships in the sea lanes and ports of asia
in an acknowledgment of washingtons worries about chinas clout , the japanese plan has also become a key regional policy objective and slogan for the united states
much of japans bolder approach can be traced back to abe himself
japans people , he told the u.n. general assembly last month , understand that their miraculous postwar prosperity is based on free trade and have eagerly awaited their leaders to act as flag-bearers in this century for asias vast new middle class
one pillar is the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-pacific partnership , also known as the tpp-11
it is the successor to the regional trade deal that the obama administration designed and that was abruptly abandoned during president trumps first week in office
abe then personally led a massive effort to save the tpp , persuading 11 nations from new zealand to canada to sign a new agreement in santiago , chile , in march
it is expected to come into force next year
there is a military side , too
japans pacifist constitution precludes it developing armed forces with war potential.
in practice , however , japans self-defense forces are well-equipped and becoming more visible in asia
this month , japans new amphibious troop brigade took part in joint exercises with u.s. marines aimed at retaking an enemy-held island
in an exercise in the philippines , japanese armored vehicles were used on foreign soil for the first time since world war ii
last month , a japanese submarine , a helicopter-carrier destroyer and two destroyers conducted live-fire exercises in the south china sea in what was seen as a message to china , which claims full sovereignty over the sea
other nations , including japan , have strongly objected to chinas military reach there
the submarine then docked in vietnam , while the surface flotilla headed to the philippines and indonesia before conducting more war games with the british , sri lankan and indian navies
china was also the elephant in the room at this months japan-mekong summit , where leaders from cambodia , laos , myanmar , thailand and vietnam joined abe in expressing concerns about land reclamations and freedom of navigation in the south china sea
jeffrey hornung , a political scientist at the rand corp. , said abe has worked hard to unite southeast asian nations behind a shared commitment to a rules-based order so they could stand up to china.
resentment over japans wartime record was one reason that tokyo had played a more passive role in asia , letting the united states take the lead and lending its support more discreetly , experts say
but with the united states leaning away under trump , japan has been forced to lean forward a little more
the fact that abe , unlike a string of short-lived predecessors , has enjoyed six years in office without a constant battle for political survival has also given him the luxury of developing a vision for the region , hornung said
this month , japan agreed to deepen defense ties with australia and to cooperate with new zealand on security and development from the south china sea to the pacific islands
tokyo can not compete with beijing in the amount of money it is spending globally , although commitments to invest $ 110 billion in asian infrastructure over five years and $ 30 billion in africa are significant sums
airports , ports and roads from papua new guinea to kenya have received japanese investment , while india is getting a japanese bullet train link between ahmedabad and mumbai
but what sets japan apart , the government repeatedly insists , is the quality , rather than quantity , of its investment , along with a commitment to environmental and financial sustainability while not creating unmanageable debt burdens
in tokyos emphasis on this approach , it is hard not to see a dig at chinas belt and road , which has been criticized for failing on precisely those fronts , experts say
meanwhile , japan is managing to improve relations with china , with abe scheduled on tuesday to make the first official visit by a japanese leader to beijing in seven years
that stands in contrast with the trump administrations more confrontational approach to china and reflects the fact that japan cant afford conflict with its neighbor , said ryo sahashi , director of the center for asian studies at kanagawa university
but sahashi laments the fact that japan has deepened ties with autocratic governments in cambodia and myanmar , undermining its commitment to a free indo-pacific
but takashi kawakami , president of the institute for world studies at takushoku university , said abe is smart to pursue a very realistic approach to diplomacy to ensure japans survival in worrying times
