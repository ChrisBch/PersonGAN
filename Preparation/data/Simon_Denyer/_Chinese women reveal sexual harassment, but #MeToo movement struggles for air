beijing when sophia huang xueqin was a young intern working for a national news agency in china , a senior male reporter and mentor tried to grope and kiss her in a hotel room where they were working together
my mind went blank , my heart was beating really fast and my body went stiff , she said
i did n't want to believe it had happened to me
i wondered if i had done anything wrong , to be misunderstood
i asked myself how someone i respected could suddenly put on such a different face
when her colleague refused to take no for an answer , huang escaped only by kicking him and kneeing him in the groin , and running off to a friend 's room
but she never reported the incident
instead , she quit her job , telling people that she wanted to try something new
more than six years later , she is finally going public , inspired by the metoo movement spreading around the world , but dismayed that it has so far failed to take root in china
finally there were people brave enough to make it public and start the conversation , she said in an interview
unfortunately , china reacted toward metoo with a lot of silence
although i could understand why that was , i really felt defeated
huang wrote about her experience on social media , helping to fuel a conversation about widespread harassment in china but one that is happening on the fringes of society and social media rather than in state-run media or the corridors of power
huang has invited others to come forward
she also started a poll on wechat , a popular messaging app in china , in which 255 female journalists shared their experiences more than 80 percent reported they had been sexually harassed , most on multiple occasions
yet very few women have joined her in going public
china 's metoo moment still has n't arrived , suppressed by a patriarchal culture and a male-dominated one-party state that obsessively protects those in power
women being resistant or vocal about their experiences are still stigmatized by people who say they simply do n't have self-respect , she said
there is also a victim-blaming culture in which women are often shamed for having been 'careless to fall victim to harassment
the reality is quite different
powerful perpetrators are habitually protected by the chinese state , ye said , while women 's rights groups are treated with suspicion by the communist party , branded as agents of foreign interference
abroad , the metoo movement has led to the downfall of many prominent men , including politicians
that 's bound to make chinese leaders nervous , said fincher
not only have some women 's posts been censored on social media , but there has been none of the in-depth , investigative reporting by news media of the kind that brought down weinstein in the united states
there 's no press freedom in china , and there 's no rule of law , so it 's extremely difficult for victims of sexual harassment to find justice of any kind , fincher said
what incentive would they have to come out
but some still have
in silicon valley , in october , luo xixi 's husband casually asked her if she had seen the news about weinstein
she turned to her phone , silently saying to herself , me too
only her tears and pleading that she was still a virgin persuaded him to relent , she said
but in the days that followed the weinstein revelations , some of chen 's former students started to share their experiences of harassment at his hands , in a private chat room for graduates
luo had seen action taken against predatory men on u.s. campuses , and when she saw huang 's account , she decided it was time to speak out
that she now has u.s. residency affords her some protection , luo says , but it is also a double-edged sword
chen , she said , had once mobilized fellow lecturers to warn female students against reporting him , telling them not to become agents of evil foreign forces
luo 's family back in china was initially very worried about the risk of a backlash if she spoke out , she said
but they later became supportive , knowing i did the right thing
a lot of friends who i had not talked to for ages also reached out to me , and encouraged me to carry on
sophia huang has still not named her attacker , but luo figured that only by naming chen would a precedent be set
she also collected the testimony of four other women , one of whom said chen made her pregnant and tried to bribe her to remain silent
luo 's post garnered more than 4 million views and 17,000 likes
when the accusations were reported in chinese media , the university suspended chen from teaching and launched an investigation
in comments to the beijing youth daily , chen denied he had done anything illegal or in breach of party discipline
he did not answer his telephone this week , and the washington post could not reach him for comment
there have been other victories
in november , an associate professor at chengdu university of technology was suspended from teaching after a student accused him of repeatedly sending female students suggestive messages
the university had ignored a direct complaint , but was forced to act after a weibo blogsite post went viral , a chinese media outlet called sixth tone reported
in december , nanchang university promised an investigation after a former student publicly accused a professor of assaulting her over a seven-month period in 2016 , until she suffered trauma-related disorders , caixin reported
luo said students from 23 universities across china have publicly called for their institutions to set up mechanisms to address sexual harassment but her woyeshi hashtag ( metoo in chinese ) has not taken off
indeed , a 2016 survey of nearly 6,600 students and recent graduates found that nearly 70 percent had experienced sexual harassment but less than 4 percent of victims had reported the incidents
many victims said it caused them additional pain communicating with the police , who sometimes would n't take their cases seriously
two former students from different universities said they had been attacked on their campuses , which have particular areas well known as trouble spots where security and lighting is poor
authorities showed no interest in addressing the issue , they said in interviews
one , who agreed to be identified only by her given name , fangzhou , said she had been groped or stalked on the campus of east china normal university in shanghai many times
a lecturer would send unwanted texts to female students in the middle of the night , she said , and tell them in public to smile or he 'd punish them
friends and family were sympathetic , but no one suggested i call the police or talk to lecturers , because they knew not much good would come out of that , she said
they advised me to put on a tougher face and retaliate verbally if it happened again with the exception of one housemate who said i was just 'attractive to perverts
