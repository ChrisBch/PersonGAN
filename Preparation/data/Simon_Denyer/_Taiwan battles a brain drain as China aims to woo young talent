after studying fashion management in london , 33-year-old gaga liu considered her choices a move back home to her native taiwan , or a job in the glitzy city of shanghai on the chinese mainland
taiwan is a very small market.
it was no contest
three months ago , like many of taiwans young people , she moved to mainland china to work as a visual merchandiser for herms
she is one of hundreds of thousands of taiwanese flooding to their booming neighbor to find work , fueling fears of a brain drain on the island
and it is a brain drain that china appears to be gleefully exploiting
china called the measures an expression of its belief that there is one family on both sides of the taiwan strait
taiwanese vice premier shih jun-ji cast it as an effort to undermine the islands economy
he said at a news conference , unveiling eight countermeasures designed to keep people at home
in 2012 , oxford economics judged that taiwan faced the largest talent deficit among 46 countries surveyed , and the research firm recently said that the conclusion stands today
in taipei , some politicians are becoming worried
in response , china has taken diplomatic and military steps to isolate and intimidate taiwan
but that has not been winning many hearts and minds here , so beijing took a different tack , one it employs all over the world using its economic might to try to buy friends
chinas economy dwarfs taiwans , and its growth rate , at nearly 7 percent last year , outstrips taiwans , which was 2.8 percent last year
faster growth and a bigger market create more dynamism , more job opportunities and more rapid career advancement , they say
official figures show that of taiwans workforce of 11 million , 720,000 have left the island for work , with more than half of them going to china
but experts say the real figure is much higher
a poll conducted in march found that nearly 9 in 10 taiwanese workers have worked abroad or are willing to do so
it does take some adjustment , he acknowledged
chinese colleagues often resent the taiwanese , liu said , thinking them to be better paid
at national taiwan university , some students said they wanted to contribute to taiwans development and would never work in china
others were aiming for careers in the united states
but many said their ambitions lay on the mainland culturally and linguistically more accessible than the west , and more achievable
so what are chinas goals in luring taiwans people to the mainland
ultimately , the unification of taiwan and china into that one happy family under communist party rule
attracting taiwanese entrepreneurs and workers to the mainland could make them more comfortable with one day being part of china , and less likely to risk their livelihoods by supporting independence
hsu said , describing his perception of chinas tactics
but it is not clear that the strategy will pay off for china
some evidence from pollsters suggests that young people feel slightly less negative toward china than older people do
but the longer-term trends are clear a growing sense of a separate taiwanese identity and a steep decline in the number of those who feel chinese , says academia sinica political scientist nathan batto
taiwan , as a progressive and vibrant democracy , feels a world away from the increasingly authoritarian regime of chinese president xi jinping , under which foreign social-media platforms are blocked and free speech is sharply curtailed
indeed , weeks after unveiling the incentives , chinas aircraft carrier was cruising through the taiwan strait , and chinese warplanes flew menacingly close to the island
in taiwan , there are particular concerns about an offer to open up chinas television , film and publishing industry to taiwanese companies
but not everyone is convinced there is reason to panic
michael boyden , founder of taiwan asia strategy consulting , says many of those going to china can not attract the best job offers in taiwan or the west
instead of trying to close its doors and stop people leaving , darson chiu at the taiwan institute of economic research says , the island needs to work harder at attracting people from other asian countries , and throw its economy open to the world
others say the brain drain could be the shock to the system the island needs to devise a long-term economic strategy
in shanghai , liu , the herms merchandiser , manages to work her way around chinas internet censorship
the worst part of living in china , she says , is polluted air and greasy food
after a few years there , she says , she will head home , where her boyfriend works , and care for her sick father
correction jason hsu who is quoted in this article is a lawmaker for the opposition kuomintang party , not the ruling democratic progressive party
