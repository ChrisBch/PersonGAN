north korea transferred the remains last week , the first tangible moves from agreements reached between president trump and north korean leader kim jong un at their meeting in singapore on june 12
initial forensic analysis suggested that the remains were likely to be those of american service members , the u.s. military said
but experts say positive identification of all the remains could take years
john byrd , director of analysis for the u.s. defense pow/mia accounting agency , told a news conference before the ceremony
byrd said the preliminary findings of the u.s. investigation were that the remains are what north korean officials said they are
they are likely to be american remains , he said
uniformed personnel carried the caskets , covered now by american flags , off the planes and set them inside a hangar as a military band played taps and pence joined commanders standing at attention
pence hailed the moment has a breakthrough after more than a decade in which no remains were handed over by pyongyang amid a deepening standoff between the nations over north koreas nuclear weapons program
the trump white house has sought to maintain momentum after trumps summit with kim , during which the two sides agreed to accelerate efforts to return the fallen troops as a trust-building measure
north korea provided enough information about where the bodies were found to allow u.s. officials to match them to battles fought in 1950 and 1951 , byrd said
one dog tag was also returned , and the family of that soldier has been informed , but it has not been established whether his remains were among those returned , byrd said
u.s. steps up calls to halt all oil transfers to north korea
indeed , north korean military officials did not claim that all items in each box went together , he said
byrd said a lot of military hardware such as helmets , canteens and boots was included in the shipment
the pentagon estimates that nearly 7,700 u.s. troops are unaccounted for from the war among them are 5,300 believed to have been killed north of the 38th parallel , which largely follows the boundary between north and south korea
most died on the battlefield and were buried in shallow graves or in cemeteries that were intended to be temporary , but some also perished in pow camps run by north korea or china , experts say
rick downes , executive director of a group of families whose loved ones never came home from the korean war , said it now appears that pyongyang is trying to help
said downes , who runs the coalition of families of korean & cold war pow/mias.
this should hasten identifications quite a bit.

troops from 16 other nations fought alongside the americans under the u.n. flag during the korean war , and diplomats and officials from all those countries placed wreaths at the ceremony
defense secretary jim mattis said last week it was possible that some of the remains could belong to soldiers from those nations , and if so , they would be repatriated once they have been identified
on wednesday , u.s. consul general angela kerwin said that no money was paid to north korea for the remains
the remains were flown from the north korean city of wonsan last friday , on the 65th anniversary of the korean war armistice , and were greeted at osan air base by hundreds of u.s. service personnel and their families
another ceremony was conducted wednesday as the remains were sent to hawaii , with bugles playing taps , as well as the last post , a call used at funerals by british and commonwealth militaries , and a south korean bugle call
national anthems of the united states and south korea were played , and the caskets were given a three-volley salute by u.s. riflemen
secretary of state mike pompeo said last month that the two sides have agreed to recommence field operations in north korea to search for missing americans , and the pentagon said it is considering sending personnel to north korea for this purpose
the united states and north korean militaries conducted joint searches for missing service members from 1996 until 2005 , and 400 caskets of remains were handed over during that period
but washington then halted the program , citing concerns about the safety of its personnel as pyongyang stepped up its nuclear program
the united states says it does not pay directly for the remains but has given the north koreans compensation for the costs of the recovery in the past
