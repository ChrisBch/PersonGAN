south korean president moon jae-in has been trying to thaw frozen ties with the north since he was elected in may , with one eye on ensuring the success of the olympics and another on opening the door to a wider dialogue
but it took until this week for the north korean leader to pick up the olive branch
in his new year 's day speech , kim jong un said he wanted to improve ties , earnestly wished the olympics to be a success and suggested that representatives meet urgently to discuss his country 's participation
from there , events moved quickly
seoul responded with an offer of talks in the border village of panmunjom
on wednesday , north korea opened a dormant cross-border hotline to facilitate communications
on thursday , washington and seoul agreed not to hold military exercises until after the games
on friday morning , seoul was able to announce that pyongyang had formally agreed to the talks
in washington , president trump and his administration signaled that they would not get in the way , with trump even tweeting that talks are a good thing
is trump making himself irrelevant on north korea
but beyond such sports diplomacy , officials and experts from washington to tokyo remain very wary
they are suspicious of kim 's motives , noting that he vowed to spend this year mass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles
kim also called on seoul not to join washington in its reckless moves for a north-targeted nuclear war , and for it to discontinue joint military exercises with the united states
i think what is important is to maintain a firm defense posture , japanese defence minister itsunori onodera told reporters in tokyo on friday , according to the reuters news agency
north korea goes through phases of apparent dialogue and provocation , but either way , north korea is continuing its nuclear and missile development
we have no intention of weakening our warning and surveillance
despite this caution , trump and south korea 's moon did agree to postpone their annual joint military exercises until after the olympics , a gesture that should allow the games to take place against a slightly less fraught backdrop
farther ahead , though , the dialogue process remains fragile and is likely to run into some very fundamental obstacles
according to the white house , trump and moon agreed during a telephone conversation to continue the campaign of maximum pressure against north korea
but kim surely will come into any dialogue process looking for financial rewards and relief from sanctions , experts say
the idea of granting relief to pyongyang will not go down at all well in washington
there does seem to be evidence that the sanctions are beginning to really bite , said paul haenle , head of the carnegie-tsinghua center in beijing
with kim feeling he may have achieved a very minimal level of deterrence vis -- vis the united states , he may now feel it is time for diplomacy
in 2016 , the workers party of korea held its seventh national congress , vowing to pursue nuclear weapons alongside economic development
on monday , kim declared the accomplishment of the great , historic cause of perfecting the national nuclear forces and stressed that his central aim this year is to improve people 's standard of living
once the nuclear weapon is completed , it 's time to focus on economic development , said chinese military commentator song xiaojun
this needs a relatively peaceful environment
moon jae-in 's administration is different from previous president park geun-hye 's
there 's an opportunity just in time the winter olympics
north korea is skilled at exploiting differences in the international coalition calling for it to denuclearize
there is also the risk of the process falling apart when the joint exercises between the united states and south korea do eventually take place after the olympics , or if north korea conducts another missile test , experts say
but process is not a goal in itself
kelly warned that north korea probably will treat its participation in the olympics as a concession for which it will expect to be rewarded
but these are not real concessions they are costless , he said
who do you think is going to pay for north korean athletes to come here
north korea will treat this as a shakedown racket
