arvaikheer , mongolia on the vast mongolian steppe , birthplace of genghis khan , a strong man has arisen
mongolias president khaltmaa battulga is a former world martial arts champion who still trains regularly , a friend of russias vladimir putin and a business tycoon with a tough-guy image
he is also a nationalist and something of a populist
battulga swept into office last year by casting himself as a trump-like outsider , a champion of the poor taking on a corrupt and self-serving political elite
like the u.s. president , this is a man who says he always wins , whose campaign motto was mongolia will win.
but he is now wrestling with the challenge of his life
mongolians overthrew an authoritarian communist regime in 1990 in a peaceful democratic revolution
nearly three decades of democracy have fostered progress but also glaring inequality , leaving nearly 30 percent of the population in poverty
corruption is rampant , the dark side of the countrys huge reserves of copper , coal and gold
battulga has an important role in setting foreign policy , but his ambitions are much grander
for the past three months , he has been touring mongolia , holding town hall meetings in every one of the nations 21 provinces , asking for popular support in his battle to improve the way his country is governed
luvsandendev sumati , director of the independent sant maral polling organization , underscores the parallels between the most recent mongolian and u.s. presidential elections
after the dirtiest presidential contest in mongolias history , he said , many people stayed away or cast blank ballots in protest
in the end , though , battulgas anti-establishment status outweighed questions about his business record and past corruption allegations
this is the most sparsely populated country in the world , the size of texas , california and montana combined but home to just 3 million people , living in the giant shadows of russia to the north and china to the south
culturally , it remains closer to its northern neighbor , but economically it is dependent on its booming southern neighbor , with more than 80 percent of its exports flowing there
distrust of china runs high here , however , and battulga exploited that to portray himself as a pro-moscow , anti-beijing candidate during the campaign
as president , though , he takes a more pragmatic approach , saying that mongolia should be friends with both countries while rebalancing to reduce chinas trade dominance
a former president of mongolias judo association , he shares a love of wrestling , and a friendship , with putin
but battulga wants american support , too
in 1990 , then-secretary of states james a. baker iii pledged that the united states would be the third neighbor to the newly democratic mongolia , a pledge repeated when president george w. bush visited in 2005
more recently , another secretary of state , john f. kerry , praised mongolia as an oasis of democracy between russia and china
yet u.s. defense and security ties with mongolia are much stronger than economic ties , which account for less than 2 percent of mongolian trade
battulga asked for improved access for mongolian textile exports to the united states
trump replied that he would be delighted to explore ways to boost trade in a fair and equitable manner , according to the mongolian presidential office
battulga began his business life in modest fashion
after graduating from art school , he sold paintings to tourists in the capital , ulaanbaatar , before sewing and selling jeans and then trading electronics across borders
he used the prize money and international connections gleaned from his sambo tournaments to get his start
a taxi service , television station and nightclub followed , as well as a lottery business
during the privatization of state-owned assets , he acquired controlling interests in a hotel and a meat-processing factory
but he was also forced to flee the country for six months after he was falsely accused of illegally importing alcohol , according to his friend and biographer dorjkhand turmunkh
another investigation into alleged corruption followed a more recent stint as roads and transport minister , but no charges were brought
battulga underlined his nationalist credentials more than a decade ago by erecting a giant statue of genghis khan on horseback in an amusement park outside the capital
he burnished his populist credentials by pledging to use proceeds from mining to pay off personal debts held by ordinary mongolians
today , battulga is mongolias most popular politician , sant maral polls show
yet questions remain for many people is the president , with his vast business empire , part of the solution or part of the problem
is he a genuine man of the people or a wannabe strongman
at the town hall meeting , complaints were manifold
they included requests to repatriate offshore funds held by the political elite and exposed in the panama papers , as well as pleas for better conditions for health workers
some railed against chinese workers in mongolia , others about overcrowding in schools
the president listened patiently for more than an hour before blaming voters for giving the rival mongolian peoples party a dominant position in 2016 parliamentary elections
but at least one listener pushed back , accusing him of being no better than his rivals
correction a headline previously on this article misidentified khaltmaa battulga as a former world judo champion
he is a former world champion at the martial art sambo and former president of mongolias judo federation
