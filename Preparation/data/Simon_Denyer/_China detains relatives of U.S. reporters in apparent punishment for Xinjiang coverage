beijing chinas security services have detained several close relatives of four u.s.-based reporters working for radio free asia in an apparent attempt to intimidate or punish them for their coverage of the muslim-majority xinjiang region , the news organization said wednesday
tens of thousands of muslim ethnic uighurs have been detained in political education centers by chinese authorities in the western province of xinjiang in recent months , according to human rights watch
the crackdown is portrayed as a strike hard campaign against terrorists and separatists but effectively means that those who express their religious or cultural identity are targeted , human rights watch said
said rohit mahajan , director of public affairs at radio free asia in washington
among those who have been detained or have disappeared are several close relatives of shohret hoshur , gulchehra hoja , mamatjan juma and kurban niyaz four ethnic uighur journalists with radio free asia in washington
the first three are u.s. citizens , while niyaz is a green-card holder
chinas war on terror becomes an all-out attack on islam in xinjiang
their reporting for the u.s. government-funded news organization has offered one of the only independent sources of information about the crackdown in the province
all three of hoshurs brothers were jailed in xinjiang in 2014 , but two were released in december 2015 after the u.s. government protested
the third , tudaxun , was sentenced to a five-year jail term in 2015 on charges of endangering state security and remains in prison
hoshur said the other two brothers were detained again in september and taken to the loving kindness school , a political reeducation center in the city of horgos
hoshur said a source told him that around 3,000 people have been detained there
hoshur said chinese authorities have contacted family members living in xinjiang , urging them to ask him to stop calling and reporting on events in the region
in a separate statement posted online last week , hoja said her brother , 43-year-old kaisar keyum , was taken away by police in october and his whereabouts are unknown
since late january , she has also lost all contact with her parents , who are both in their 70s and in poor health
shortly after calling her aunt earlier this month , hoja said , she received a call from a friend in west virginia whose mother lives in urumqi , xinjiangs capital
her friend said that around 20 of hojas relatives have been arrested by the chinese police because of her reporting
when her brother was detained , police told hojas mother that her employment with rfa was the reason for his detention , the news outlet said
it said hoja has heard that her relatives may have been detained for being in communication with her through a wechat messaging group
juma , deputy director of rfas uyghur service , reported that his brothers ahmetjan and abduqadir juma were detained in may 2017
ahmetans whereabouts are unknown , while abduqadir has been taken to a prison in urumqi
he suffers from heart and health issues that require medical care , but his sister has been denied access to him
rfa uyghur broadcaster niyazs youngest brother , hasanjan , was arrested last may and soon afterward sentenced to six years in jail for holding ethnic hatred.
human rights groups say china represses the rights , culture and freedom of worship for uighur muslims
xinjiang has been home to long-running separatist unrest , and several violent attacks have occurred there in recent years , blamed by the authorities on islamist extremism
in a report issued tuesday , human rights watch described how a system of predictive policing , involving constant mass surveillance and big data analysis , was being deployed to bolster the crackdown in xinjiang
the police gather data from all-pervasive security cameras , some of which have facial recognition or infrared capabilities , the report said.
wifi sniffers monitor smartphones and computers , while car license plate and identity card numbers are gathered at the regions countless security checkpoints , all cross-checked against health , banking and legal records , it said
police officers , communist party cadres and government workers also visit homes to gather data on families , their ideological situation and their relationships with neighbors
one interviewee said even owning a large number of books could arouse suspicion , unless one worked as a teacher
data is also gathered on frequency of prayer and visits abroad
constant surveillance and harassment have made it extremely difficult for foreign reporters based in china to cover the crackdown in xinjiang effectively , with locals too scared to talk to reporters and security officials obstructing or detaining several journalists who have ventured there
rfa said it has been in contact with the state department over the detentions , but chinas ministry of foreign affairs declined to say whether it has received any communications from the u.s. government
hoshur said china might be using voice recognition technology to intercept his phone calls to gather information from xinjiang
almost all of them are cut off in under a minute , he said
the state department said in a statement wednesday , we urge the chinese government to cease policies that unduly restrict the exercise of freedom of religion or that otherwise deny individuals their ability to enjoy their human right
