beijing hong kong 's government banned a 21-year-old pro-democracy activist from standing for election to the territory 's legislature on saturday , in a move her party called payback for the 2014 umbrella movement street protests
agnes chow was a leading figure in those protests , during which tens of thousands of students and young people calling for democracy occupied central hong kong for more than two months
she was hoping to stand for a by-election next month for the hong kong island constituency
upholding the basic law is a basic legal duty of a legislator , it said
if a person advocates or promotes self-determination or independence by any means , he or she can not possibly uphold the basic law or fulfil his or her duties as a legislator
hong kong is governed under the one country , two systems model that allows for a high degree of autonomy and an independent judiciary but not full democracy
china 's communist rulers have made it clear they will not tolerate any talk of independence for hong kong , and critics will inevitably see their influence in the decision to ban chow
demosisto called the ban payback against an entire generation and said the ruling effectively stripped the rights of all of its members from standing in elections , barring the party from the legislature
demosisto members have both been imprisoned and barred from entering the political establishment , it said in a statement
the government 's motivation is to demolish the youth 's desire to push forward social change in hong kong
momentum gained from the umbrella movement will be absent from the legislature
chow said her party was not advocating independence , only the right to choose
hong kong demosisto has never had a pro-independence stance but we believe hong kong people have the right to self-determination on the future of hong kong , chow told reporters , according to the reuters news agency
our political freedom should be well protected under the legal system of hong kong , she said
the decision to disqualify my candidacy means that the political rights are being handicapped
the by-election is one of several made necessary after six pro-democracy lawmakers were barred from the territory 's legislative assembly , a move that followed a legal interpretation issued by the chinese national congress in beijing
earlier this month , wong was sentenced to jail for a second time over his role in the umbrella movement protests
he was released tuesday on bail
