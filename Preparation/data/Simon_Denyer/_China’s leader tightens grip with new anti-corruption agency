it is likely to be used on two fronts to root out suspected graft and to enforce strict ideological control and loyalty to the party and president , experts say
its provisions have provoked a surprising public outcry from chinas legal community , with scores of lawyers joining to warn of a serious crisis in the rule of law and a watershed moment in the nations legal history
ultimately , though , the communist party brushed those objections aside
the new body was given formal rubber-stamp approval by the national peoples congress at the closing session of its annual meeting on tuesday
the parliament already has voted to alter the constitution to accommodate the national supervision commission ( nsc ) as part of changes that also abolished term limits on the presidency
on sunday , the parliament installed yang xiaodu , who is believed to be a protege of the president , as the first head of the nsc
xis campaign to tackle endemic corruption within the communist party is thought to have won him popular support
but it has also served an important dual purpose to impose his will on the communist party and to root out rivals
the central commission for discipline and inspection , the agency tasked with battling corruption within the party , will form part of the new nsc
the state-run peoples daily newspaper said monday , arguing that other developing countries have found that corruption worsened after they adopted western-style democracy
yet for many lawyers , a community that has suffered an unprecedented crackdown under xis rule , the light of due process , and of a transparent and fair legal system , is being extinguished
the anti-corruption campaign often extracted confessions through shuanggui , a system of detention outside the legal process in which suspects were held incommunicado , and sometimes tortured , in secret locations for months
the new law replaces shuanggui with a new system called liuzhi , which is supposed to be subject to stricter controls , promising detainees adequate food and rest , for example
but in practice , it is unlikely to be any different , lawyers and human rights groups say
detainees can be held without access to lawyers for up to six months , while the right to inform families of a detainees whereabouts can be waived if investigators think that doing so would harm their investigation
the group received no response to the letter , said cheng hai , a beijing lawyer who helped draft it
other lawyers who voiced objections had their comments scrubbed from the internet or were later persuaded to publicly back the proposals
tong zhiwei , a lawyer who had earlier written about his concerns , was not given permission by east china university of political science and law to talk to the washington post
but in previous essays , he argued that the proposals would weaken the power of the judiciary to defend social justice , would infringe on the basic idea embodied in chinas constitution of equality before the law and would not be effective
research by political scientists dimitar gueorguiev and jonathan stromseth showed that the more provinces within china had empowered citizens to monitor the bureaucracy by increasing public access to government budgets and decision-making the more success they had in fighting graft
by contrast , the new agency is explicitly based on a top-down political approach , they wrote in an article for the brookings institution
that leaves it vulnerable to political currents and manipulation and could dampen public participation in the fight against corruption
but it does help to fulfill one of xis key goals , experts say reimposing communist party control over every aspect of public life in china , partly through fear
said carl minzner , a professor at fordham law school
in the short run , this approach could make it easier for xi to impose his will
for example , chinas success in curbing air pollution last year came about partly because the ministry of environmental protection had the backing of the anti-corruption authority , pointed out andrew polk of the trivium consultancy in beijing
as a result , the ministrys inspectors , previously often ignored , were now feared , he said
but too much fear can make officials scared to take risks , or to make any decision , unless explicitly ordered to do so and then overzealous in carrying out those orders , experts warn
