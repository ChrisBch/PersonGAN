tokyo north korean leader kim jong un pledged wednesday to visit seoul for the first time but made no concrete promises on the dismantling of his nuclear program at the end of a summit with south korean president moon jae-in in pyongyang
in a joint news conference , the two leaders vowed to end hostility and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity , but there was little of substance to move the process of denuclearization forward , experts said
the talks were supposed to pave the way for a second summit between kim and president trump later this year
experts said it was far from clear that kim had made concessions that would make a summit an attractive proposition for the u.s. administration , but trump himself reacted positively , calling the news very exciting on twitter
in a joint statement , north korea pledged to permanently dismantle a missile engine test site and missile launcher at tongchang-ri in the presence of experts from related countries.
that is a site the north koreans had already promised to dismantle , although allowing in inspectors would be a step forward
based on trumps agreement with kim at their june summit in singapore
bruce bennett , a senior defense analyst at the rand corp. , told south koreas arirang tv that these promises were extremely vague and didnt amount to denuclearization , especially because kims regime was continuing to manufacture nuclear weapons this year
talk is cheap , he said.
what washington has been looking for is action.
moons arrival tuesday in pyongyang had been awash in pomp and flattery as he embraced kim jong un and lavished praise on the north korean leader to begin their third summit this year
moon and kim did sign an agreement to ease tensions across the worlds most militarized border
that includes the establishment of a buffer zone near the front line to suspend artillery drills and field maneuvers , as well as an agreement to each pull back 11 border guard posts by years end
they agreed to set up a buffer zone in the yellow sea to suspend firing of guns and maritime drills , as well as a no-fly zone in border areas to prevent accidental plane clashes

but more ambitious was moons attempt to remove an impasse between pyongyang and washington over who should make the next move in their dialogue about detente and denuclearization
on that score , there appeared to be no progress the norths pledge to consider closing yongbyon was clearly conditional on further action from the united states
the united states wants north korea to take a meaningful step toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program
pyongyang , however , is pushing for the united states to declare the 1950-1953 korean war formally over and claims trump made a promise to that effect in singapore
it was the first time since october 2007 and only the third time since the division of the peninsula more than six decades ago that a south korean leader visited the north korean capital
on tuesday , moon spoke grandly of a new era of cooperation between the two koreas that would cut through continents and reach around the world.
kim said the two men were on a path of peace and unification without stopping.
he expressed his deep gratitude to moon for his outreach despite the obstacles
moon admitted that it would be hard to reach an agreement on the complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula but said the two leaders enjoyed trust and friendship.
he even compared the way they had held hands when they first met in april to an affectionate couple.
when he arrived at pyongyangs airport with his wife , kim jung-sook , moon was greeted warmly by the north korean leader and his wife , ri sol ju
a military band played , and several hundred guests cheered and waved flags that included the image of a unified korean peninsula
the leaders then inspected a military guard and stood on a podium as goose-stepping troops marched past
moon waved to and even shook hands with some members of the crowd , appearing genuinely moved by the reception even though it was carefully staged by the most repressive regime on the planet

later , moon and kim drove through the streets , past more cheering crowds chanting unification
they started in separate cars before joining each other in a single open-top car , moon saluting the crowds enthusiastically and beaming broadly
he later said he was surprised to see how developed pyongyang was
there was no hint of concerns about its human rights record
moon said at the dinner
kim appeared marginally more grounded in reality as he escorted moon to his lodgings at a state guesthouse earlier in the day
kim said , according to a pool report , adding that although the accommodation and itinerary might be subpar , they were presented with our best sincerity.
moons first summit with kim in april unleashed a wave of optimism in south korea about the prospects for peace across the peninsula , but the good feelings have waned as the scale of the task ahead has become more obvious
and moons popularity has fallen sharply , albeit largely because of a rising unemployment rate and soaring property prices
moon brought with him an entourage including the heads of some of south koreas largest conglomerates , as well k-pop stars
the two koreas agreed to compete together at the olympics in 2020 and make a joint bid to hold the summer games in 2032
