ginowan , japan its election time on the japanese island of okinawa , and as always the presence of u.s. military bases is center stage
this semitropical island is home to about 19,000 u.s. marines as well as the largest u.s. air force base in the asia-pacific
the sprawling installations , the pentagon says , are vital not only for the defense of japan but also for keeping the peace and projecting american power throughout the region
but local resentment has been bubbling for decades
the american military is the main election issue , polls show
and tamaki is the narrow favorite to become okinawas new governor in sundays vote
that outcome would create another headache for the u.s. military and more stress in the u.s. alliance with japan
the pentagon calls the alliance the cornerstone of stability in the indo-pacific region
but president trump again asked at the u.n. general assembly in new york this week whether japan , a country with a large trade surplus with the united states , was contributing enough to its own defense
japans abe suspends construction at u.s. marine base on okinawa
the hot topic on okinawa is marine corps air station futenma , which is surrounded by housing in the ever-expanding city of ginowan
there is a two-decade-old plan to relocate the base to a more remote site at henoko , farther north on the island , and move nearly half the marines to other bases in guam , hawaii and australia
but tamaki says thats not good enough
like the previous governor , takeshi onaga , who died in office last month , he opposes the expansion of the base in henoko and wants a broader redistribution of u.s. forces to other parts of japan
u.s. bases take up nearly one-fifth of the land on okinawa , which is twice the size of guam but has more than 10 times the population , at 1.85 million people
okinawa is home to roughly half the american military force in japan
tamakis conservative opponent , atsushi sakima , is backed by japans ruling liberal democratic party ( ldp )
he says the base relocation should go ahead , freeing up a large swath of prime land for development
but he also wants immediate measures to reduce the noise of low-flying aircraft and to lower the risks of crashes or pieces of equipment falling to the ground in residential areas
sakima doesnt directly mention the bases at his rallies
instead , with ldp politicians at his side , he dangles the prospect of government subsidies and investment if okinawa accedes to tokyos wishes on the bases
in japans okinawa , saving indigenous language is about more than words
business interests , especially in the construction industry , appear to be backing him
at tamakis rallies , supporters are generally older , many of them retired
behind their views are deeper cultural and historical sentiments , including a feeling that this island once the independent kingdom of ryukyu , which traded with both japan and china bears an unfair share of the burden of the u.s. military presence in japan
ethnically different from the people who live on the main islands of japan , the people of okinawa have long felt looked down upon
taxi driver seiji hanashiro , 70 , grew up on tales of the 1945 battle of okinawa , when his hastily conscripted teenage elder brother was killed
tens of thousands of okinawan civilians died in the 82-day battle in which much of the island razed
high school teacher erika tamayose , 41 , complained of discrimination by tokyo but also disagreed that the bases make her safer
as with many people on okinawa , her views are shaped by pacifism
after world war ii , the u.s. military continued to rule okinawa until 1972 , two decades after returning the rest of japan to self-rule
okinawa played a vital role during the vietnam war the troops flooding through the island brought money , but the fact that japanese courts couldnt touch them if they broke the law also caused resentment
over the years several incidents fueled outrage , notably the rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl by three american servicemen in 1995
in 2004 , a helicopter crashed into a university building , which still bears the scars of the blades and burn marks as a reminder
last december , a window fell out of a helicopter and onto the playground of an elementary school
today , those children rush into shelters every time they hear an aircraft approaching at playtime
u.s. military imposes alcohol ban across japan after fatal okinawa crash
but there is no doubting the strategic value of the u.s. military bases in okinawa
the bases provide a credible , lethal military force to back diplomacy , he said , reassuring allies and ensuring the freedom of the seas
they are there to respond to threats including china and north korea , and to humanitarian needs from super-typhoons in the philippines to earthquakes in japan
tokyo pays around 190 billion yen ( $ 1.67 billion ) a year toward the cost of keeping u.s. troops in japan , but some critics say it could do more to promote the benefits of the u.s.-japan alliance
the two main local papers in okinawa , meanwhile , are vehemently anti-base and never miss an opportunity to fuel indignation
more than 90,000 signatures have been collected to petition for a referendum on the presence of u.s. bases
tamaki is the son of an okinawan waitress and an american marine , who left the island before he was born and whom he has never met
although he speaks little english , he has faith in u.s. democracy to listen to his entreaties and the will of the people of okinawa
he said at a rally
but experts are less sure
the government of japan says it has the constitutional right to make national security decisions and is determined to push ahead with the replacement base plan
