beijing china raised alarms wednesday over what it called president trump 's outdated cold war mentality after an address that described beijing as a global rival and set a tougher line against china 's economic and military reach
the president 's language in his state of the union address represented a fundamental reappraisal of the u.s. relationship with china one that has been building for years but has crystallized since trump took office last year , experts say
engagement long accepted as the path to a safer world and a freer china has been replaced with a chillier sense of strategic competition
on wednesday , china 's foreign ministry called on the united states to abandon its outdated cold war mentality , manage its differences with beijing and realize that win-win cooperation is the only viable option
a chinese foreign policy scholar called trump 's language alarming and provocative , while state media warned that malicious rivalry and further enhancement of american military might would only end in disaster
around the world , trump said , we face rogue regimes , terrorist groups and rivals like china and russia that challenge our interests , our economy and our values
in confronting these horrible dangers , we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict , and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense
beijing was not pleased to be spoken of as a danger in the same breath as rogue regimes and terrorist groups , but trump 's language did not come as a complete surprise
trump calls for unmatched power against china and other perceived rivals
the idea of engagement has underpinned the u.s.-china relationship for decades , bill bishop wrote in his axios china newsletter
now the u.s. government appears to have declared engagement has failed
the change was spelled out most clearly by the white house in its national security strategy dated december 2017
for decades , u.s. policy was rooted in the belief that support for china 's rise and for its integration into the postwar international order would liberalize china , the document says
contrary to our hopes , china expanded its power at the expense of the sovereignty of others
among the complaints that china gathers and exploits data on an unrivaled scale , and that it spreads features of its authoritarian system around the globe , including corruption and the use of surveillance
at the same time , china is building the most capable and well-funded military in the world , second only to that of the united states
in its national defense strategy released last month , the pentagon argued that the central challenge to u.s. prosperity and security is the reemergence of long-term , strategic competition by 'revisionist powers
it is increasingly clear that china and russia want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model gaining veto authority over other nations economic , diplomatic , and security decisions , the document says
specifically , it calls china a strategic competitor that uses predatory economics to intimidate its neighbors while militarizing the south china sea , a region where china claims full sovereignty despite strong opposition from the united states and its southeast asian allies
daniel rosen of the rhodium group , long a leading advocate of engagement with china , calls the trump administration 's position a sea change in perceptions of u.s
such sentiment has been further fueled by the feeling that china is walling itself off from the global internet and trying to control cross-border data flows on which businesses depend
but the shift in chinese attitudes also predates xi and can be traced back to the western financial crisis a decade ago , experts say
since the crisis , the communist party has come to believe more strongly that its economic system offers a better model than that of the west , with markets allocating some resources but with the party ultimately in control of the economy
but those trends have stalled or gone into reverse
enter trump , a president singularly obsessed with the u.s. trade deficit with china and numbering among his advisers men such as economist peter navarro and trade representative robert e. lighthizer , who have long warned of a threat from beijing
andrew polk , a partner at the research firm trivium china , says the rethinking of engagement has been a structural trend , but the conversation has been put on steroids under trump
nor is it a conversation being heard only in washington in germany , there are growing concerns about china 's attempts to divide and conquer the european union by wooing its poorer nations
in australia , there are widely expressed fears of chinese interference
so far , trump has not definitively translated his words into action , partly , he says , because he is seeking china 's help in isolating north korea
but he imposed import tariffs on solar panels and washing machines last month , and expected action over intellectual property theft and steel and aluminum imports has left many here worried about a trade war
the possibility of u.s. military action against north korea , china 's neighbor and traditional ally , could lead to a more troubling confrontation involving the world 's most powerful nations
this shift in us-china relations is a serious concern , he wrote
in a relationship predicated not on the expectation of convergence but of rivalry and competition , opportunities for cooperation will be missed
