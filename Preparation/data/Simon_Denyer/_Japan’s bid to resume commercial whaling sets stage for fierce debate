tokyo japan will open a new bid to resume commercial whaling operations , as well as demand major reforms to the international whaling commission ( iwc ) , at a global conference in brazil next week
tokyo claims that the iwc has become dysfunctional after not living up to its initial mandate in 1946 to find a balance between preserving whale stocks and allowing the orderly development of the whaling industry
japans proposals already have received fierce opposition , setting the stage for a showdown at the annual commission meeting beginning monday in florianpolis , brazil , which japans representative will chair
we have to rescue the iwc before it collapses , hideko moronuki , senior fisheries negotiator in the fisheries agency in japans ministry of agriculture , forestry and fisheries , said in an interview
faced with collapsing whale stocks , the iwc agreed to a moratorium on commercial whaling from 1986 , a move credited with saving several species from imminent extinction
but japan , iceland and norway have continued to hunt whales
japan justifies its annual hunt in the name of scientific research , which it says is necessary to evaluate global populations of whale species
the fleet that killed 333 whales for research
in march 2014 , the international court of justice ruled that japans antarctic hunt had no scientific basis
wildlife groups say it is a thinly veiled attempt to keep the industry alive , making sure boats , skills and a market for whale meat are maintained
unhappy with the moratorium , japan has been threatening to pull out of the iwc since 2007
but moronuki said japan would rather seek changes within the organization
japan wants permission to hunt antarctic minke whales , common minke whales , brydes whales and sei whales , he said , citing iwc population estimates in the tens of thousands for three of the species and of more than 500,000 for the antarctic minke
the iwc rejected japans last request to resume a small-scale hunt in 2014
it also wants to form a new sustainable whaling committee that would recommend commercial catch limits , and move to a system in which proposals can be passed by simple majority vote rather than the current three-quarters majority
with the support of many smaller island and coastal nations some of which benefit from significant financial aid from japan that reform could be enough for japan to get its way
any attempts to undermine a global moratorium
in a new report , the environmental investigation agency ( eia ) and the animal welfare institute said that japan , norway and iceland had killed 38,539 whales since the moratorium took effect , more than 22,000 killed by japanese boats alone
clare perry , the eias ocean campaigns leader , said any resumption of commercial whaling would be a massive victory for rogue whalers who have defied the international ban and an absolute disaster for the worlds whales
in may , japan touched off outrage after reporting that its whaling fleet had killed 122 pregnant minke whales in the southern ocean last winter
it will face more criticism at a meeting of the convention on international trade in endangered species in october , after the organizations secretariat investigated its sei whale hunt and questioned whether the convention was being broken
the eias perry rejected the idea that the convention needed to adhere to its original goals , arguing that global attitudes have changed
some defenders of whale hunting accuse the west of hypocrisy for condemning japan while engaging in large-scale factory farming , where animals often live and die in horrendous conditions
moronuki said the united states is guilty of a double standard by allowing native communities in alaska to continue whaling while not wanting japan to do so , even though whaling is a tradition in some communities in japan
perry rejected that argument
