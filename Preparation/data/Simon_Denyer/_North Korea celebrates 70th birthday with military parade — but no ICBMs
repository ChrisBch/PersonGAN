the parade was more low-key than a previous parade staged in april 2017 that featured an array of ballistic missiles and exacerbated tensions with the united states
much of the parade was dedicated to civilian efforts to boost the economy , the associated press reported , underscoring a major policy shift announced by the countrys leader , kim jong un , earlier this year to focus on economic development
another major theme was the reunification of the korean peninsula , carved into two by the soviet union and the united states after world war ii
the absence of nuclear-capable missile systems was seen as a conciliatory gesture during a period of intense diplomatic outreach and negotiation
said ankit panda , a strategic expert and adjunct senior fellow in the defense posture project at the federation of american scientists
president trump applauded the lack of intercontinental ballistic missiles on his twitter account sunday
the parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the democratic peoples republic of korea began with ranks of soldiers , followed by tanks , trucks carrying rocket launchers and heavy artillery
some tanks carried traditional slogans calling on the army to destroy the u.s. imperialist aggressor , the sworn enemy of the dprk.
but that imagery was balanced with flowers and colored balloons , floats on the economy and unification , and spectators waving flags of a unified korea , reuters reported
the parade came at a sensitive time as the united states and south korea try to engage the north in a process they hope will eventually lead to it giving up its nuclear arsenal
but while south koreas president moon jae-in is due in pyongyang for a summit with his north korean counterpart from sept. 18 to 20 , talks with the united states have hit a roadblock over who should make the next move
washington wants pyongyang to move decisively toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program , but north korea insists it first wants a declaration that the 1950-53 korean war is over , as a way of helping guarantee its security and build trust
the korean war ended in an armistice but not a peace treaty
an end-of-war declaration would only be a first step toward an eventual peace treaty , but many in washington fear such a declaration could be used to undermine the legitimacy of the u.s. troop presence in south korea
kim himself did not speak at the event , leaving it to kim yong nam , the head of the countrys parliament , to make an address emphasizing the economic goals of the regime , not its military might , reuters reported
li stood at kims right during the parade , underlining the marked improvement in relations between the neighbors this year , with kim traveling to china three times to meet xi
kim was seen laughing and holding hands with li as he oversaw the celebrations
between the two nations , according to korean central news agency
russia also sent its third-highest ranking official , valentina matviyenko , the chairwoman of its federation council , or upper house of parliament
she had an audience with kim on friday , at which he was also seen laughing
the celebrations were set continue later sunday with the opening of what are known as north koreas mass games , a synchronized display of gymnastics and dance performed by tens of thousands of people working in unison
the games are being staged for the first time since 2013 and are officially called glorious country this year
