visiting the country for the first time just a month before president trump is due to meet north korea leader kim jong un in singapore david beasley said he hoped north koreas children would be the beneficiaries of what he called this new spirit.
wfp estimates that more than 10 million of north koreas 24.8 million people are undernourished , with 1 in 3 young mothers and children under age 5 suffering from anemia
it feeds about 500,000 women and children every month , including with porridge and high-energy biscuits , but says its food aid program is severely underfunded.
the sanctions agreed to by the united nations security council allow for humanitarian aid to flow into the country through u.n. agencies , on the condition that the united nations monitors the aid to ensure it is not diverted to the government or military
what the new u.n. sanctions on north korea mean
but many countries are skeptical about sending aid to a country except in extreme circumstances that could ultimately serve to support the regime or indirectly allow it to spend more money on its nuclear and missile program
wfp officials are also not given full access to the country to properly establish its humanitarian needs
its springtime , and he said he had seen men and women everywhere in the fields , working with their hands , with oxen , rakes , hoes and shovels , and very little mechanization
every available inch of land , including even road embankments , appeared to be under cultivation , noting what he called an incredible work ethic.
droughts , floods and government policies combined to create famine in the 1990s that killed hundreds of thousands of people , and although the situation has improved significantly since then , rains were poor last season , he said
the largely mountainous country also suffers from a shortage of arable land , beasley said , with only 15 to 20 percent of land available for cultivation
that creates a problem feeding the nations children

beasley said he had held frank discussions with north korean officials in pyongyang about the need to grant wfp staff greater access and more data about nutrition in the country , telling them , we cant help you unless you help us.
in the past , he said , officials may have been hesitant to speak to people from the outside world , but beasley said he had been pleasantly surprised by the openness he encountered and a willingness to learn from wfps expertise
beasley said he hoped the peace process and the lifting of sanctions would deliver a brighter future for the children of north korea , he said
he added , using the initials of the countrys official name
but in beijing , not everyone is convinced
said one diplomat , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the diplomat was not authorized to be quoted by name
