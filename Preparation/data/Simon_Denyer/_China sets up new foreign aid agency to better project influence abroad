beijing china announced tuesday it will establish a new agency to coordinate its foreign aid program as part of an effort to project its global influence more effectively
the establishment of a new international development cooperation agency came as part of the biggest shake-up of the governments structure in two decades
the changes cut the number of ministries in chinas cabinet , the state council , by eight , down to 26 , to streamline government and reduce bureaucratic infighting
but it will also strengthen the communist partys top-down control , one of president xi jinpings overriding goals , officials said
the overhaul bolstered the role of the countrys environment ministry , which will now take responsibility for the fight against climate change , and included the merger of the banking and insurance regulatory agencies to improve supervision of the countrys debt-laden financial sector
the changes were announced at a session of the national peoples congress , the countrys rubber-stamp parliament , and will be formally approved saturday
liu he , the presidents top economic adviser and a member of the partys 25-member politburo , called the changes profound and revolutionary in a tuesday article for peoples daily , the communist party newspaper
xi cleared to rule indefinitely as china officially scraps term limits
the new agency for international development coordination will integrate responsibilities currently undertaken by the ministries of commerce and foreign affairs and integrate its work with xis ambitious belt and road project , a major effort to increase chinese lending for infrastructure development around the world
the new agency will draft foreign aid policies , grant aid and supervise projects
enhance its coordination and better serve the nations diplomatic strategy including the belt and road project , state councilor wang yong told parliament
li fan , founder of the world and china institute think tank , said the new body would be comparable to the u.s. agency for international development and japans international cooperation agency and , in a similar manner , would serve chinas diplomatic objectives
china provides few details of its aid program , but said it sent more than half of its foreign aid of more than $ 14 billion between 2010 and 2012 to africa
analysis by aiddata , a research project at the college of william & mary in williamsburg , va. , showed that u.s. official development assistance between 2000 and 2014 reached $ 366 billion , dwarfing the $ 81 billion coming from china
but beijing nearly closed the gap with a much larger flow of $ 216 billion in commercial , non-concessional lending
the belt and road project may lead to even more commercial lending to the continent
last week , then-secretary of state rex tillerson warned african nations to carefully consider the terms of their borrowing from china , lest they forfeit their sovereignty.
but china daily said beijings investment in infrastructure such as railways , bridges and ports was welcomed by african nations
china likes to boast that its finance in africa does not come with political strings attached , unlike western aid
critics say that has enabled it to lend to governments with poor human rights records , such as sudan or zimbabwe under former president robert mugabe
the same could also be said for the united states , especially during the cold war , when it poured money into corrupt and autocratic regimes largely because they were not communist
the overhaul of government is the largest since then-premier zhu rongji carried out a similar streamlining in 1998
it appears to weaken the countrys top economic policymaking body , the national development and reform commission ( ndrc )
sometimes dubbed the little state council because of its power within the bureaucracy and wide range of responsibilities
the ministry of environmental protection has been renamed the ministry of ecological environment and will take over responsibility for climate change policy from the ndrc
the new ministry will also supervise the work of other ministries to prevent groundwater pollution , including pollution from agriculture and sewage , as well as marine environmental protection and nuclear radiation safety
li said the details of how the merger would work were still being awaited , including the size of the climate change team in the new ministry and who would head it , which would provide more clues as to its political clout
