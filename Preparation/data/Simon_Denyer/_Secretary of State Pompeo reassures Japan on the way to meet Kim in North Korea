tokyo secretary of state mike pompeo met prime minister shinzo abe on saturday and reassured him japans interests would not be forgotten as he heads to pyongyang to continue talks over north koreas nuclear and missile program
pompeo left for pyongyang on sunday where he is expected to meet north korean leader kim jong un , as he tries to set the stage for another summit between kim and president trump
his tokyo stop was designed to reassure the united states most important ally in asia that its interests would not be forgotten in negotiations with kim
japanese foreign policy experts worry that washington could cut a deal with pyongyang that limits its intercontinental ballistic missile program but leaves north korea with shorter-range missiles that could strike tokyo
the japanese government is also demanding that pyongyang come clean about the fate of japanese citizens who were abducted by north korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s , an issue that incites considerable concern among the japanese public
in a meeting with abe , pompeo said that japans concerns would be addressed and that he wanted to make sure the two countries were fully in sync with regard to missile programs , as well as chemical and biological weapons
abe said he appreciated that pompeo had come to japan before going to pyongyang for talks on north koreas nuclear program
he said , adding that he was also trying to set up the next trump-kim summit
maybe we will get further than that.
after a summit between the leaders of the two koreas last month , kim said he was prepared to permanently dismantle his countrys main nuclear site at yongbyon , but only if the united states took corresponding steps to build trust
at the time , it appeared that meant a declaration to formally end the 1950-1953 korean war , a signal that hostilities between the two countries were over
but during the past few days , pyongyang appears to have increased its demands , signaling that it may also want an easing of sanctions before moving forward
pompeo has said that sanctions will be lifted only after north korea fully and verifiably dismantles its nuclear weapons program
washington is believed to have asked north korea to supply a list of its nuclear and missile facilities as a next step , but south koreas government says the north is not prepared to meet this demand
south korean foreign minister kang kyung-wha told the washington post last week that seoul believed that such a list could spark a long argument between pyongyang and washington over verification , which would not be conducive for building trust
instead , she said , seoul favors a different approach , in which each side takes chunks of action to build trust , such as the dismantling of yongbyon in return for u.s. steps such as an end-of-war declaration
in an editorial on thursday , rodong sinmun , the official newspaper of the workers party of korea , argued that the united states should not focus on maintaining sanctions but instead on building confidence between the two nations with a sincere attitude.
it wrote , accusing washington of brigandish and frivolous misbehavior
north korea refers to itself as the democratic peoples republic of korea , or dprk
