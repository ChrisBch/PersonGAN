tokyo former south korea president lee myung-bak was sentenced to 15 years in prison on friday for corruption , the latest in a string of former leaders of the country who have faced similar charges after leaving office
he was also fined 13 billion won ( $ 11.5 million )
lee , 76 , a conservative politician and former hyundai executive , served as president from 2008 to 2013 , when most of the crimes took place
his successor park geun-hye was sentenced to 25 years prison in august in a separate corruption scandal , after being ousted from office last year following months of street protests
lee was convicted of taking millions of dollars in bribes from businesses and other sources and for also using a private auto-parts company as a channel to embezzle tens of millions more
lee was not present at the verdict , with his lawyer citing poor health as well as the courts decision to allow live television coverage
he had previously denied the charges , and claimed they were politically motivated and brought by the current liberal government of president moon jae-in
presidential scandal shows that korean disease is far from cured
south korea moved from military dictatorship to democracy in the late 1980s , but its political system continues to be undermined by high-level corruption and collusion between the political elite and the powerful business sector
a succession of presidents have vowed to strengthen the battle against corruption , only to later become embroiled in scandals involving themselves , family members or key aides as they left office or after surrendering power
while in office , lees government had initiated a corruption investigation into former liberal president roh moo-hyun in 2009 , after which roh committed suicide
lee claims the case against him is an act of revenge by moon , who was rohs chief of staff
moon has angrily rebutted those charges
but his attempt to pass a constitutional amendment was blocked by conservative lawmakers
two other former presidents , chun doo-hwan and roh tae-woo , both former army generals , were convicted of corruption and other offenses in 1997 , although they were both pardoned the same year
