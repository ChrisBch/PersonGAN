beijing anwar ibrahim , the standard-bearer of malaysias reform movement , was released from prison and granted a royal pardon wednesday in one of the most dramatic developments since an opposition alliance scored a stunning win in national elections last week
anwar , 70 , was convicted in 2015 of sodomy in a case that he maintained was trumped up to crush his opposition movement
supporters chanted reformasi ( reform ) as he walked free before being whisked to the royal palace to meet the king , news agencies reported
anwar served as mahathirs deputy and finance minister in the 1990s before falling out with him during the asian financial crisis , being sacked from the government and forming the reformasi movement
within weeks , mahathir had him jailed on charges of sodomy and corruption
a second jail term followed in 2015 under prime minister najib razak , who lost last weeks election and faces a corruption investigation
the associated press reported that police searched najibs house late wednesday , apparently seeking documents as part of the probe
malaysians usher in a new era as they usher out the ruling coalition
how mahathir and anwar will get along , along with whether and when the prime minister will stand aside for the man who built the opposition alliance , is one of the biggest questions facing malaysia
for now , anwar , whose wife , wan azizah ismail , is the new deputy prime minister , says he wants to spend time with his family , rest and carry out some speaking engagements
he insists he is in no hurry to take a spot in the cabinet or take over as premier
on wednesday , anwar called his release a victory for all malaysians , regardless of race or religion , who stood by the principles of democracy and freedom
he told reporters outside his house in kuala lumpur.
there is a new dawn for malaysia.
he thanked mahathir for his help in getting him released and pardoned , the latter a critical step in allowing anwar to return to politics
he said , his tie and jacket off and sleeves rolled up after he returned from the palace , news agencies reported
during the campaign , mahathir promised to stand aside for anwar once he had been pardoned , but the veteran leader is now talking of running the country for one or two years to fix its financial problems
anwars first trial in 1998 was a dramatic affair , with the man who had only just been dismissed as deputy premier appearing in court with a black eye and bruises , sparking international condemnation of mahathir
at one point , prosecutors produced a mattress that they said was stained with semen , accusing anwar of having sex with two male aides
anwar was convicted and sentenced to prison
in 2014 , he was again convicted of sodomy in a separate case during the najib administration
an appeal was rejected and his prison sentence upheld in 2015
amnesty international said anwars release was a landmark moment for human rights in malaysia and called for the repeal of repressive laws muzzling freedom of expression and assembly , the associated press reported
