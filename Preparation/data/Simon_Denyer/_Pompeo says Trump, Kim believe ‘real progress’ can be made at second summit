the two sides agreed to set up working-level negotiating teams to finalize the date and time for a summit , as well as set the stage for a successful summit meeting , he said
pompeo told reporters in south korea , where he flew after his visit to pyongyang
the secretary of states previous trip to north korea , in july , did not go so well
he came away from it saying the two sides had made progress , only for north korea to denounce him for making gangster-like demands and raising cancerous issues
on that occasion , he did not meet with kim
but this time , the north korean reaction to the talks was much more positive
korean central news agency ( kcna ) reported that kim had warmly welcomed pompeo in pyongyang and spoke highly of him.
north koreas official name is the democratic peoples republic of korea , or dprk
dialogue and negotiations would continue to develop favorably and a good program for a second summit would be developed
during pompeos meeting in pyongyang , kim also invited inspectors to visit the punggye-ri nuclear test site to confirm that it has been irreversibly dismantled , the state department said
the secretary of state also confirmed that inspectors would be invited to a separate missile test site at tongchang-ri , but declined to comment on which organization might be allowed in to either site
kim made a commitment to allow inspectors into both sites when he met south korean president moon jae-in last month , but experts said it was important to have him explicitly reiterate that promise to pompeo
after that inter-korean summit , kim also said he was prepared to permanently dismantle his countrys main nuclear site at yongbyon , but only if the united states took corresponding steps to build trust
