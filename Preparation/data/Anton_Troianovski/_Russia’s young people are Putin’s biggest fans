in russias upcoming presidential election , the 20-year-old student , who knows that journalism in her country is not free , will nonetheless vote to reelect vladimir putin
here , where the forest of the taiga meets the grassy steppe , the putin generation is no different from anywhere else across russias vastness coming of age without a rebellious streak
todays russian young adults have no memory of life before putin , who first took power as their president 18 years ago
some have taken to the streets in protest , but social scientists say many more have grown to accept him
polls show that putin enjoys greater support among youth than among the public at large
to western eyes , young russians such as mamay who espouse some liberal values but back putin live in a world of contradictions
in fact , their readiness to accept those contradictions helps explain putins grip on power
on march 18 , russians will go to the polls to confirm a fourth presidential term for the 65-year-old former kgb officer who turned this countrys young , chaotic democracy into an authoritarian system beholden to his rule
he has batted back the opposition thanks to his control over russias main television channels , the security services and the judiciary but also because , as even many of his opponents acknowledge , most of the country supports him
according to a december survey by independent polling firm levada center , 81 percent of adults approve of putin as president including 86 percent of russians 18 to 24 years old
among the age group , 67 percent told levada they believed the country was going in the right direction , compared to 56 percent of the general public
the most internationally connected generation in russian history , with access to more information than any of their predecessors , is now helping putin solidify his authoritarianism
rather than dwell on putins crackdown on his opponents , young russians draw a sense of personal liberty from those freedoms they do enjoy a mostly open internet , an open job market and open borders
many of them reject state tv as propaganda but nevertheless repeat its central tenet that russia needs putin to stand up to u.s. aggression
and perhaps most important , these russians seem shaped by a collective history they never knew by fear of a return of the crisis-stricken 1990s or the stifling soviet era
young russians made headlines in the past year for forming the backbone of thousands-strong street protests backing opposition leader alexei navalny , inspired by the youthful anti-corruption activists youtube videos spotlighting apparent wrongdoing
but analysts warn its wrong to take those protests as a sign of a wave of anti-putin fury reminiscent of the arab spring
the stories of three young people in kurgan a city of about 300,000 on the trans-siberian railway near the kazakh border help explain why
all three are voting for putin out of a mix of hope , resignation and fear
their reasoning begins with a visceral sense of a darker , poorer past
in the 1990s before putin came to power lawlessness in kurgan was such that innocent locals could get killed simply for sitting in the wrong seat on a bus or in a movie theater , mamay recalls her grandmother telling her when she was little
mamay says she now has the same hope for her own future in putins russia
mamay wants to be a journalist , but she says the press in russia is not free
she follows the news on meduza , a latvian-based russian-language news outlet frequently critical of putin
privately owned news outlets sell their reporting to the highest bidder , while state television amounts to government propaganda , she said
it was putin , when mamay was little , who forced some of russias richest men to yield control of the countrys main television networks
but she doesnt fault the president for russias stifled media atmosphere
in fact , she recently found a way to practice her chosen craft
she joined the local vladimir putin youth fan club as its press secretary
shaburov , the 18-year-old entrepreneur , recently moved from the countryside to kurgan , where he first tried to make ends meet by delivering sushi and pizza and working as a taxi driver
his latest venture is called crowd investing , and he said he was hoping to move to moscow to take advantage of the greater opportunities in the capital
he said he realizes that russia offers its citizens fewer freedoms than western countries do and that putin may have something to do with this
but he prefers to focus on the freedoms he does have , such as being able to start a business and traveling abroad
shaburov said he has watched navalnys videos highlighting apparent government corruption
he said he is upset to see officials steal public money in broad daylight and grandmothers and kids dragged from navalny rallies by the riot police
but this is no time for an untested leader like navalny , he said , given russias tumultuous history
the sense that things used to be much worse and could again get much worse is a defining characteristic of the putin generation , researchers say
in a study of more than 6,000 russian university students last year , 80 percent of respondents said , like mamay , that they believed they had more opportunities than their parents
at the same time , a clear majority said they worried about an uncertain future and the threat of a new world war
more than 47 percent of the students surveyed said they would vote for putin in the presidential election , compared to 7 percent who chose navalny , the no
2 candidate among the responses
the community theater where rybin works part-time used to be filled with snow and dead birds because of a hole in the roof , the aspiring director recalls
it was finally renovated last year and now features about 500 plush blue seats thanks to a putin-ordered regional development program
but to rybin , who sports bright red , thick-frame glasses and boasts a collection of more than 30 bow ties , putins biggest achievement is keeping russia safe
he has prevented the war in ukraine , rybin said , from spreading into russian territory
the idea that ukraine threatens its much bigger neighbor russia sounds jarring to western ears , since it was russia that backed separatists there and annexed the ukrainian peninsula of crimea
but rybin learns about current events from russian state tv which scholars say continues to influence many young russians even if they watch less television than their elders
rybin said he hadnt heard anything about allegations that russia interfered in the 2016 u.s. presidential elections
not everyone is convinced of the staying power of young russians pro-putin views
journalist alexey dedov , who teaches television journalism at the local university and works for the kurgan office of state broadcaster rossiya 1 , said he felt many youths were going along as kremlin supporters just to fit in
but young russians acceptance of the status quo goes beyond whom theyll vote for
for people like rybin , shaburov and mamay , the kremlins years-old strategy of managed democracy creating the appearance of political freedom despite an increasingly authoritarian reality appears to be working
asked whether russia had free speech , rybin responded by referring to the raucous talk shows on state television , in which politicians and journalists hurl invective at one another but hardly ever criticize putin
to the navalny activists in kurgan , many of whom are also in their late teens and early 20s , putins backers are living with blinders on
they say that people who support putin because they fear the worst should recognize that accepting the status quo means things will only get worse
russias stagnant economy has been growing at an average of just over 1 percent a year since 2008 , and some analysts predict that the kremlin crackdown on political dissent will intensify after the election
said one of the navalny volunteers , 19-year-old nikita ilyin
shaburov , however , sees no major change on the horizon
a putin presidency for life , said the young man born just months before the leader took power , may well be better than a lurch into the unknown
