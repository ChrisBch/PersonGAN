putins speech , less than three weeks before the russian presidential election , represented an escalated level of martial rhetoric even by his pugnacious standards
for the first time , putin claimed that russia had successfully tested nuclear-propulsion engines that would allow nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and underwater drones to travel for virtually unlimited distances and evade traditional defenses
he also warned that moscow would consider a nuclear attack , of any size , on one of its allies to be an attack on russia itself , and that it would lead to an immediate response
putin did not specify which countries he considers allies
in doing so , he said , the united states had failed to take seriously russias strength
no one listened to us , putin said.
listen to us now.
putin ally warns of new arms race in response to u.s
pentagon spokeswoman dana white said u.s. officials were not surprised by putins comments , but gave no details about the extent of knowledge on russian military development
she also rejected putins suggestion that russia needed to upgrade its firepower because of defensive buildups in the west
our missile defense has never been about russia , white told reporters
top u.s. generals have issued warnings for months about the development and deployment of new russian cruise missiles , urging congress and the pentagon to step up technology that could better defend against them
cruise missiles hug the terrain , flying low and fast , allowing them to evade radar and missile defense systems that are designed to shoot down missiles that fly more slowly and at an arc
air force gen. lori robinson , the commander of u.s. northern command , which is assigned to defend the continental united states , said in senate testimony in mid-february
putin on thursday described russian missile capabilities that had been little-discussed publicly in washington in recent years cruise missiles equipped with nuclear-propulsion engines , giving them essentially unlimited range and the ability to follow an unpredictable flight path
to demonstrate the point , putin showed a video animation of a missile launched in the russian arctic evading missile defenses as it crossed the atlantic , rounded the southern tip of south america , and headed toward the united states
what russias newly announced nuclear systems actually mean
his claims in his annual speech to lawmakers jolted close observers of the russian military
an independent russian military analyst , alexander golts , said that weapons experts he had spoken to after the speech were all in shock , as was i.
while the weapons putin unveiled have likely been in development for years , his confrontational tone appeared in part to be a response to the trump administrations more hawkish approach to nuclear weapons
putin said that pentagon plans announced last month to introduce two new types of nuclear weapons and broaden scenarios for their use provoke great concern.
with a defense budget far smaller than that of the united states , russia is ill-positioned to compete in a traditional arms race
but putins visual presentation of new russian weaponry seemed designed to show washington that it intended to maintain pace with the united states as a nuclear superpower
it wasnt immediately clear whether the weapons putin described were operable or how close they were to being ready for deployment
but the speech , analysts said , represented a new milestone in mounting u.s.-russian tensions , which have been rising since the ukraine crisis erupted four years ago
said dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center think tank
in his two-hour speech in a historic hall just outside the kremlin walls , putin claimed that late last year russia had successfully tested a cruise missile that was propelled by a nuclear-powered engine
the missile will be able to fly close to the ground and follow an unpredictable flight path , rendering existing missile defenses useless , putin said
he also said that russia in december had concluded a multiyear testing cycle for an underwater , nuclear-powered drone
the speech also came at a significant domestic moment
with the march 18 presidential election looming , the kremlin is looking to high voter turnout to add legitimacy to what appears certain to be a fourth six-year presidential term for the 65-year-old putin , who first took power in 1999
for the first half of the speech , putin talked about improving russians lives at home , promising to double government spending on roads , health care and regional development
the talk of high-tech weapons , analysts said , suggested to russian voters that putin was ensuring their security even if many domestic problems remained to be fixed
putins comments come ahead of the u.s. militarys planned release of its new missile defense policy
though u.s. missile defenses were initially conceived during the cold war as a way to shield the country from soviet missile threats , they evolved after the collapse of the u.s.s.r. to focus on defending against rogue nations such as north korea and iran
those systems would more likely be successful in downing a limited number of missiles launched by north korea or a single missile accidentally launched by russia
the united states has installed aegis missile defense systems in romania and poland , which has angered the kremlin , even though washington has long said the installations are primarily aimed at countering an attack on the united states or its allies from iran
russia has long argued that those installations violate the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty , a claim that the united states has denied
