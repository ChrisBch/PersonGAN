trump signals a more deliberate approach on syria
haleys russian counterpart , vassily nebenzia , in turn accused the united states and its key allies france and britain of bellicose rhetoric and saber-rattling that have heightened tensions
russia called for the emergency meeting on syria as tensions remained high over a potential u.s. airstrike in response to last saturdays suspected chemical weapons attack that killed dozens in the town of douma
the united states , france and britain have said the syrian government is most likely responsible for the deaths in douma
russia and syria have both denied it
as the prospect of a u.s. strike loomed , the first team of investigators from the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons arrived in syria to look for evidence , with a second team expected soon
u.n. secretary general antnio guterres told the security council that he feared events could escalate rapidly into a regional and even global conflict , and he urged all states to act responsibly in these dangerous circumstances.
trump chooses impulse over strategy as crises mount
one of the biggest questions concerning a potential u.s. strike on syria is how russia would react
the country is assads most powerful ally and has thousands of troops and military advisers , as well as air defense systems , deployed in syria
russias military has threatened to shoot down any u.s. missiles that put russian lives at risk
russia also could fire at the launch platforms used potentially u.s. planes or ships
russian officials have said u.s. and russian military staffs remain in contact regarding syria , even as russian media have carried stories in recent days about the potential outbreak of world war iii as a consequence of a u.s. airstrike against assad
russian president vladimir putin warned french president emmanuel macron in a phone call friday that the situation remained tense , the kremlin said in a statement
frances u.n. ambassador , franois delattre , said the syrian governments decision to use chemical weapons meant that it had reached a point of no return , necessitating a robust , united and steadfast response.
announcement of that approval thursday did not specify that the response should be military , although that was the expectation
pierce said friday
opposition lawmakers urged may to first seek parliaments consent before committing to any military action
meanwhile , the russian defense ministry on friday presented what it said was new evidence showing that britain had staged the chemical attack
maj. gen. igor konashenkov , a ministry spokesman , alleged that a group of people , some with video cameras , had run into a hospital in the area and doused patients with water while shouting that there had been a chemical attack
footage of the ensuing panic formed the evidence of the attack , konashenkov said , according to the ria novosti state news agency
troianovski reported from moscow
