at stake is the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty , or the inf , an agreement ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev signed in 1987 that eliminated an entire category of nuclear missiles and removed more than 2,500 of them from installations across europe
after years of trading accusations about violations , the united states and russia look poised to reach a final showdown over the pact , after trump announced on saturday that he was no longer willing to abide russian violations and therefore would withdraw
were going to terminate the agreement , trump said.
were going to pull out.
the breakdown of the treaty threatens to escalate a nascent arms race among washington , moscow and beijing and further chip away at an arms control architecture that american and soviet diplomats painstakingly constructed during the cold war
officials say the trump administration hasnt formally decided to withdraw , but bolton went to moscow planning to inform the kremlin of the intent
in europe , the possibility of the treatys dissolution has raised fears of a return to the 1980s , when both washington and moscow were dotting the continent with nuclear-tipped missiles , prompting hundreds of thousands of europeans to protest
those tensions ultimately led to the inf

gop lawmakers criticize trumps decision to withdraw from nuclear arms treaty
kremlin press secretary dmitry peskov warned that a u.s. exit from the inf would prompt russia to take measures to ensure national security.
after bolton met monday with his russian counterpart , nikolai patrushev , the nations security council sounded a conciliatory note
the council said in a statement , according to the interfax news agency
the inf bans the testing , production and deployment of nuclear and nonnuclear ground-launch ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges from 500 to 5,500 kilometers
when it was signed at the white house , the pact elicited widespread support in the west
the senate ratified it with a 93-5 vote
european allies rejoiced that the midrange nuclear missiles would no longer be deployed in their backyards
by eliminating short-flight missiles , the pact theoretically enhanced the decision-making time for leaders faced with a nuclear strike
but the treaty began fraying in recent years
starting in 2014 , as ties between the white house and the kremlin deteriorated over ukraine , the obama administration began saying publicly for the first time that russia was cheating on the pact
the trump administration has since said russias deployment of a ground-launch cruise missile known as the 9m729 , or the ssc-8 in nato parlance , violates the treaty
putin countered that u.s. missile defense systems in romania violate the treaty because they could launch intermediate-range missiles
the united states has refuted that allegation , saying the systems launch only interceptor missiles or missiles designed to hit other missiles which dont fall under the treaty
the inf has long rankled bolton
bolton argued that the inf had become obsolete because it constrained only washington and moscow , just as other nations , including china , iran and north korea , remained free to develop intermediate-range missiles
he said the united states should expand the treaty to include other members or withdraw entirely to develop its own deterrent systems in the intermediate range
bolton and desutter wrote
after his meeting with patrushev , bolton gave an interview to ekho moskvy radio in which he said asian allies threatened by chinese missiles had cheered trumps comments on the inf
he said there would be further consultations with u.s. allies and russia in the coming months , and underscored how both washington and moscow were being constrained by the treaty
the breakthrough that led to the inf came after an agonizing episode in the cold war arms race
beginning in the late 1970s , the soviet union deployed intermediate-range nuclear ballistic missiles , known as ss-20s , that could hit european capitals in a matter of minutes
the united states responded by stationing intermediate-range pershing ii nuclear missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles in western european nations
the buildup of nuclear missiles prompted more than a million germans to protest in the streets , and caused concern throughout europe
the pressure on moscow ultimately led to the inf , which eliminated ss-20 and pershing ii missiles altogether
if the united states withdraws from the inf , nato will have to decide how to build up defenses against a russia unfettered in its production and deployment of intermediate-range missiles
tension between the trump administration and european capitals would likely stymie the redeployment of intermediate-range nuclear missiles to europe
bolton , writing in the 2014 article in the wall street journal , suggested the united states wouldnt need to put pershing ii-style missiles back in europe
he expressed confidence that nato could safeguard europe and counter russia with intermediate-range deployments on weapons systems in the air and at sea
the inf covers only ground-launch missiles
the united states could find other ways to defend against a russia unfettered by the inf
the trump administration earlier this year announced plans to develop a nuclear-tipped , sea-launch cruise missile in response to russias violations of the inf
the u.s. military could also put tomahawk cruise missiles on ground launchers and deploy them in the pacific
they are currently on ships and submarines
the pentagon , mandated by congress , is also in the early stages of developing a missile banned under the inf for possible deployment if the treaty falls apart
europeans are watching the negotiations anxiously
the statement added
when it comes to the treaty ceasing to exist , advocates of withdrawal see little to lose other than constraints on the u.s. military , particularly in asia
disarmament advocates , however , argue that even a tattered version of the treaty is constraining russia from what could become a much larger deployment of intermediate-range missiles
daryl g. kimball , executive director of the arms control association , said washington hasnt exhausted the diplomatic possibilities for saving the treaty
he suggested , for example , that the united states inspect the russian missile in question and propose either modifications that could prevent it from flying at intermediate distances or an end to its deployment altogether
in exchange , he suggested , the united states could arrange russian inspections of u.s. missile defense installations to demonstrate that the systems contain only defensive interceptor missiles
kimball criticized the trump administrations approach
