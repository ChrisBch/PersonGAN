president trump on monday put the brakes on a preliminary plan to impose additional economic sanctions on russia , walking back a sunday announcement by u.s
ambassador to the united nations nikki haley that the kremlin had swiftly denounced as international economic raiding.
preparations to punish russia anew for its support of syrian president bashar al-assads government over an alleged chemical weapons attack in syria caused consternation at the white house
haley had said on cbs newss face the nation that sanctions on russian companies behind the equipment related to assads alleged chemical weapons attack would be announced monday by treasury secretary steven mnuchin
but trump conferred with his national security advisers later sunday and told them he was upset the sanctions were being officially rolled out because he was not yet comfortable executing them , according to several people familiar with the plan
administration officials said the economic sanctions were under serious consideration , along with other measures that could be taken against russia , but said trump had not given final authorization to implement them
administration officials said monday it was unlikely trump would approve any additional sanctions without another triggering event by russia , describing the strategy as being in a holding pattern
sometime after haleys comments on cbs , the trump administration notified the russian embassy in washington that the sanctions were not in fact coming , a russian foreign ministry official said monday
how trump , a reluctant hawk , has battled his top aides on russia and lost
privately , another white house official said haley got ahead of herself and made an error that needs to be mopped up.
but other administration officials expressed skepticism that haley had merely misspoken
they said haley is one of the most disciplined and cautious members of the cabinet , especially when it comes to her public appearances
she regularly checks in with trump personally to go over her planned statements before she sits for television interviews
haley issued no clarifying statement on sunday after news organizations , including the washington post , reported prominently that the new sanctions would be announced monday based on her comments to cbs
asked monday morning why it had taken 24 hours for the administration to walk back haleys comments , one white house official said only that there had been confusion internally about what the plan was
the sanctions were developed in recent weeks as part of a ready menu of potential military and economic measures for trump to enact to strike back at assads government and his russian patrons , according to a senior administration official
in early march , following a relatively small-scale chemical weapons attack in syria , trump was upset there was not a ready set of options , so then-national security adviser h.r
mcmaster prepared a series of measures that were not enacted
but the late-march poisoning of a former russian double agent on british soil led the trump administration to trigger the first round of the economic sanctions on that menu and to expel 60 diplomats in coordination with the european allies
the reported chemical attack by assad in douma in early april set off a debate in the white house about whether the united states should trigger another round of economic sanctions to punish russia
the president seemed to refer to those measures friday night in a speech announcing strikes against the assad regime
he promised to respond with all instruments of our national power military , economic and diplomatic.
but it was unclear to officials whether trump wanted to hit russia with the next set of options on the sanctions menu or wait for another attack , according to the senior administration official
said the senior administration official.
often we dont know about them.
doubting the intelligence , trump pursues putin and leaves a russian threat unchecked
early in the trump administration , there were conflicts between haleys team and the president on russia
shortly after trumps inauguration , haley delivered a speech at the united nations that recommitted the white house to the obama administrations policy on sanctions related to russian aggression in ukraine
the speech was cleared by david cattler , then a senior official on the national security council , but the remarks frustrated trump , who demanded to know who had approved them
lots of people got yelled at some by the president , said a u.s. official at the united nations
cattler , in turn , was pushed out of his job a couple of weeks later in a reorganization of the nsc by mcmaster
white house officials said trump has been impressed with haley lately , particularly her remarks about syria over the past week , and stressed monday that the president holds her in high regard
in the absence of a permanent secretary of state , haley has been the face of american diplomacy , playing an especially prominent role over the past week as the trump administration responded to the attack in syria
the russians were listening
after haleys comments , kremlin press secretary dmitry peskov told reporters in moscow that the sanctions were a u.s. ploy to oust russia from international markets and constituted undisguised attempts of unfair competition.
trump tries to appear strong on syria even as he prepares to withdraw
but there was a subtle shift in moscow toward a less confrontational tone , even as officials continued to slam u.s. sanctions as veiled attempts at gaining economic advantage
russian lawmakers were crowing friday that they were going to make the united states pay for already imposed sanctions , potentially by blocking american imports or u.s.-russian aerospace cooperation , or allowing russians to violate u.s. intellectual property rights
russia , one top lawmaker promised , was going to hit the americans in the gut.
but on monday , senior lawmakers in the lower house of parliament , the state duma , decided to hold off until may 15 before considering any counter-sanctions against the united states
speaker vyacheslav volodin said the duma needed to meet with experts and the business community first
deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov also urged calm
