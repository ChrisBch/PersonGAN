for nearly three weeks , the world has watched president trump downplay the disappearance and apparent slaying of journalist jamal khashoggi , and waited for the most powerful man in the world to act
they are waiting still
trumps inconsistent and cautious remarks about the case have renewed questions about u.s. credibility and complicated the global response , emboldening adversaries such as russia and china and discouraging robust action by traditional allies , according to analysts and former u.s. officials
in effect , he added , the u.s. is setting a new standard for itself and in so doing , may be setting a new standard for the world
the white house did not respond to a request for comment
trump this week denied giving cover to the saudis
i want to find out what happened , where is the fault , and we will probably know that by the end of the week , he told the media
khashoggi , who was born in saudi arabia , was a contributing columnist to the washington post and a lived in virginia
articles he wrote for the post included criticism of saudi arabias government
on oct. 2 , he entered the countrys consulate in istanbul and never emerged
turkish intelligence believes he was killed and dismembered there by saudi agents
after denying any knowledge of khashoggis fate , the saudi government said saturday that he was killed during a fistfight in the consulate
the alleged assassination comes just months after the attempted assassination on british soil of sergei skripal , a former russian spy who acted as a double agent
it comes just weeks after the chinese head of interpol temporarily disappeared during a trip home
said nicholas burns , a professor of the practice of diplomacy and international relations at harvard who previously held several senior diplomatic roles
he added , but its been more than two weeks and theres been no signal.
into this void steps russia , which is using the khashoggi case to call out alleged hypocrisy by washington and to seek an advantage in the complex geopolitics of the middle east
at a foreign policy conference in sochi , russia , on thursday , president vladimir putin said the trump administrations cautious response to khashoggis disappearance underlined u.s. double standards
putin argued that the west was quick to punish moscow after the poisoning of skripal in may , but acted differently with khashoggi
russia denies involvement in the poisoning , but western allies levied sanctions and expelled russian diplomats.
theres no proof in regards to russia , but steps are taken , putin said
putin has invested deeply in ties with riyadh as part of a broader push to rebuild russian influence in the middle east
he hosted king salman last year for the first-ever visit to russia by a saudi monarch , and invited crown prince mohammed bin salman to join him at the opening match of the soccer world cup in june
on sunday and monday , russian officials , including a deputy foreign minister , met with the crown prince and other top officials in riyadh for talks on the conflict in syria , the russian foreign ministry said
a rupture between the united states and saudi arabia now could play into the kremlins hands
while western officials and business leaders have been dropping out of a marquee business conference in saudi arabia next week , their russian counterparts have followed suit
russias $ 10 billion sovereign wealth fund plans to actively participate in the conference , a spokesman said , and bring along top ceos from russia , china and other countries.
for china , like russia , this critique of u.s. actions is not about stopping abuses but shutting down conversations about human rights , analysts say
said bonnie glaser , director of the china power project at the center for strategic and international studies , a washington think tank
traditional u.s. allies in the middle east have for the most part fallen in line behind saudi arabia , the regional power , saying little about trump
europe also has been cautious but is now mustering a piecemeal response , experts said
germany , britain and france this week called for saudi and turkish authorities to mount a credible investigation , claiming that they were treating the matter with utmost seriousness , but not doing much else
french and german leaders have suggested that they could take a harder line
europe may need to correct its policies toward saudi arabia , juergen hardt , foreign policy spokesman for german chancellor angela merkels conservatives , told local media
human rights groups and opposition politicians are pushing for a change in policy
emily thornberry , britains shadow secretary of foreign affairs , wrote in the guardian
so far , trumps calculus seems to be that its worth protecting the status quo
critics wonder whether the saudi leadership is the best partner for those plans
richard haas , the president of the council on foreign relations , wrote on twitter
haas said trump has taken putins word that he didnt interfere in the 2016 election , north korean dictator kim jong uns word on denuclearization and now the saudi leaderships word on khashoggis disappearance
there was a time when u.s. policy was trust but verify , he said
now its trust but look away
