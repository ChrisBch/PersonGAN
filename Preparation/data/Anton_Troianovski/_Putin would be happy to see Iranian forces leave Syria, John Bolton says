jerusalem russian president vladimir putin told the united states that an iranian presence in syria does not tally with russian interests and that he would be content to see all iran-linked forces go home , national security adviser john bolton said wednesday
bolton made the comments at the end of a three-day visit to israel , where he spoke with officials ahead of a meeting with his russian counterpart in geneva
his claims clashed with recent statements by russian officials , who have said that iran is playing a constructive role in syria
israel has been lobbying the united states to do more about iranian entrenchment across its northern border in syria as the civil war winds down , demanding that all forces linked to its arch foe leave
persuading russia to assert its influence in containing iran could be one of israels best hopes to achieve this
alongside iran , russia has provided syria with the military assistance that helped tip the civil war in president bashar al-assads favor
the issue was raised in discussions between putin and president trump in helsinki last month , and the russian president also spoke with bolton on the subject three weeks earlier , the u.s. national security adviser said
however , putin said that i cant do it myself and that a joint u.s.-russia effort may be needed , bolton said
he was responding to a question about a reuters report that quoted bolton as saying that putin told trump that he could not eject iranian forces from syria
other russian officials have struck a different tone in public , however , casting iran as a constructive partner to russia in ridding syria of extremist militants
russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said , the interfax news agency reported wednesday
according to russias tass state news agency
in syria , accidental bulwark against iran shows confusion of trump policy
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said that boltons upcoming meeting with nikolai patrushev , russias security council head , would deal with many complicated issues
earlier comments by bolton from israel were not received well by the kremlin
peskov also said wednesday that boltons comments that russia is stuck in syria and looking for others to fund postwar construction , made in an interview with reuters , were incorrect
bolton said the united states remains determined to finish eliminating islamic state forces in the country , but also to deal with the presence of the iranians.
he cautioned syria against using chemical weapons as the government gears up for an offensive in idlib province
previously a vocal advocate of regime change in iran , bolton has stressed since taking his position in the trump administration last year that ousting the iranian government is not u.s. policy
however , the united states wants a massive change in iranian belligerence in the region , he said
european nations have been attempting to save the deal , although the threat of u.s. sanctions has caused private-sector companies to flee the iranian market
bolton said he briefed israels prime minister and other officials on diplomatic discussions that u.s. officials have had with the europeans and on the american determination to drive iranian oil exports down to zero.
they won that very big thing , he said
but its not an issue of quid pro quo , he said
