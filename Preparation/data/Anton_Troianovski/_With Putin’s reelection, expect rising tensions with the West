moscow when russian president vladimir putin took the stage on a square outside the kremlin to claim victory in sundays national election , he did so at an open-air concert celebrating the fourth anniversary of his annexation of crimea
he thanked the crowd for their support in the very difficult circumstances of recent years and then led a chant russia
with his landslide win sunday , putin got the election show he wanted
as he figures out whats next , expect rising tensions with the west
in the weeks leading up to putins reelection to six more years in power , the president hardly campaigned and offered few concrete plans for major domestic reforms
he did , however , awe russians with displays of fantastic new weaponry while state-controlled television intensified a drumbeat of reporting about the threats allegedly posed by the united states and its allies
the unified story line russia is under attack , and it needs a strong leader to survive
russias young people are putins biggest fans
as putin assembles his next government in the coming months , hell need to manage the competing interests of a ruling elite angling for influence in a post-putin era that will someday arrive
the result , many analysts say , is that as infighting over the countrys domestic course continues at the top , putin will have an interest in intensifying the conflict with the west
pavlovsky said british prime minister theresa may , for instance , delivered putin a pre-election present by quickly accusing russia of the attack on former spy sergei skripal and mustering an assertive response
the british response angered russians , he said , motivating some voters who may have otherwise stayed home
putin said about the skripal case in his victory news conference , referring to russias hosting of the championship this summer.
its simply unfathomable.
more quietly , russia is threatening escalation in syria , where its fight in support of president bashar al-assad is raising the risk of a military collision with the united states
last week , the head of russias general staff , gen. valery gerasimov , accused washington of planning a cruise missile strike on damascus
he offered no evidence but pledged that russia would retaliate against the missiles and launchers used.
putin ally said to be in touch with kremlin , assad before his mercenaries attacked u.s. troops
six years ago , when he last ran , putin stepped up his anti-american rhetoric amid large and continuing street demonstrations against him
u.s. officials , thinking it a campaign ploy , expected him to dial back the heat once he was safely in office but that never happened
and its unlikely to happen now
escalation abroad helps putin consolidate power at home
as a power struggle within the ruling elite over his succession looms , he may need it
with his win of another six-year term sunday , the road is clear on paper for putin , who is 65 , to rule until 2024 something that would give him close to a quarter-century in power
but what then
the first signs of how putin manages succession will come when he puts his next government together after his inauguration in may
keeping prime minister dmitry medvedev in his current post will be a sign putin wants to minimize the speculation about his successor
reinserting the comparatively liberal former finance minister alexei kudrin into the government would be a setback for the hard-line military and intelligence wing in the kremlin and a sign that putin may seek to carry out some economic reforms
despite the uncertainty in the kremlin , the pro-democracy opposition to putin looks more disorganized than its been in years
the most striking symbol sunday of the russian presidents staying power , in fact , was not his inevitable electoral victory
it was a debate streamed on youtube between two leading faces of the opposition anti-corruption activist alexei navalny and former liberal television host ksenia sobchak
in a live broadcast that more than 100,000 people viewed at one point , navalny lit into sobchak for running at all
her decision to do so , he said , simply added a patina of legitimacy to putins false and fake election
the government allowed sobchak to run and gave her television airtime , while navalny was barred from the ballot and was kept off tv
sobchaks future is another wild card
as the daughter of putins onetime mentor , the late st. petersburg mayor anatoly sobchak , she is in the unique position of having a personal relationship with putin even though she criticizes him publicly
she has announced plans to form a new political party something that could further sideline navalny , who is the russian opposition leader with the most nationwide support and who wants to tear down the putin system
one can hardly expect serious change , kolesnikov said
