u.s. astronaut tyler n. nick hague and russian cosmonaut alexey ovchinin had made it halfway to space before suddenly going in the other direction
they fell about 31 miles back to the ground , according to nasa
they were quickly located by rescue teams and flown back to the launch site for an emotional reunion with their families
the failure of the soyuz ms-10 rocket effectively halts all american and russian access to space pending an investigation into what went wrong
for seven years , since nasa retired the space shuttle , the united states has relied on russian hardware to ferry americans to and from the space station
three crew members currently on the space station are in no danger , nasa said
they have adequate supplies for an extended mission beyond their planned dec. 13 return and can get home in a spare soyuz spacecraft currently attached to the space station
but there are limits to how long the soyuz module can remain in orbit before its fuel is no longer reliable
another three-person crew is scheduled to launch in december for the station , but that mission is imperiled by thursdays rocket failure
nasa officials said its possible that at some point the astronauts in space will have to return to earth with no crew to replace them
nasa is not eager to abandon , even temporarily , the $ 100 billion orbital laboratory , which requires constant maintenance and has never before been operated solely by ground commands
big decisions lie ahead , but on thursday , u.s. and russian officials expressed relief after the close brush with disaster
this was a terrifying day but not a tragic one because the escape system worked
the launch looked good until a red light illuminated inside the capsule
failure of the booster , a translator called out at mission control near moscow , according to a transcript on russian state television
the computers took over
the capsule automatically separated from the rocket
the crew felt a jolt and then quickly reported being weightless they were in free fall back to earth
the crew members then initiated a ballistic trajectory that put hague and ovchinin under more than six times the force of gravity and put the capsule into a spin
we are getting ready for the g loads , ovchinin reported to mission control.
g load is 6.7.
they were briefly out of contact during the 34-minute descent
nasas deputy chief astronaut , g. reid wiseman , said his heart was pounding as he wondered where the capsule would come down
at that point only gravity was in control , and rescue teams in helicopters raced to where they thought the capsule would land
parachutes deployed automatically
the gray capsule tumbled onto its side on a grassy flatland
a photograph showed one crew member kneeling , the other reclining against the parachute fabric , while three rescuers approached
hague and ovchinin were examined by medical officials and deemed in good shape
russia suggests sabotage on the international space station
russian officials said crewed space launches have been suspended pending an investigation into the malfunction
russias interfax news agency also said all uncrewed launches could be halted for the rest of the year , citing space program sources
thursdays launch failure came at a dicey moment in the u.s.-russia space partnership
the two nations have been congenial 250 miles above the earths surface even when events on the ground , such as the russian annexation of crimea or the interference of russia in the 2016 election , have stoked tensions
but the united states and russia have been at odds over the cause of a small hole discovered in august on the soyuz module soyuz ms-09 currently docked at the space station
moscow says the hole , now repaired , was the result of deliberate drilling and has suggested sabotage , while the u.s. space agency said this week that investigators will determine the cause
companies in the cosmos a series from the washington post
against that backdrop , nasa administrator jim bridenstine traveled to kazakhstan to witness thursdays launch and meet his russian counterpart , dmitry rogozin of roscosmos
the summit turned far more dramatic than either had imagined
rogozin said he was forming a state commission to investigate what caused the failure
it was the first time the soyuz had failed on a launch to the 20-year-old international space station
russian deputy prime minister yury borisov , who oversees space flight , promised to share all information from the investigation with the united states
the failure puts tremendous pressure on nasa and the two companies spacex and boeing it is counting on to fly its astronauts to the space station
both companies have faced repeated delays
nasa recently announced that neither would fly even an uncrewed test flight this year and that the first flights with astronauts on board wouldnt happen until the middle of 2019
said lori garver , a former nasa deputy administrator who was a strong advocate for commercial crew during the obama administration
said space policy expert john m. logsdon , a professor emeritus at george washington university
in june , the spacecraft boeing plans to use to fly nasa astronauts to the international space station suffered a significant setback when officials discovered a propellant leak during a test
the last time moscows space program had a crewed launch failure was during the soviet era in 1983 , when a soyuz booster exploded
cosmonauts vladimir titov and gennady strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launchpad
