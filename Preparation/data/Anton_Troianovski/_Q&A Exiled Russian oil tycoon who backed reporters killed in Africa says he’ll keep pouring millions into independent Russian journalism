mikhail khodorkovsky , the former ceo of the russian oil giant yukos , used to be russias richest man
in 2003 , as he was increasingly criticizing russian president vladimir putin , khodorkovsky was arrested on fraud charges and spent a decade behind bars
since being freed in 2013 , khodorkovsky has lived in exile and become one of putins most prominent critics
he funds independent russian news outlets , including the investigations management center the organization with which three russian journalists were working when they were killed in the central african republic this week as they worked on a documentary about russian mercenary forces
khodorkovsky spoke to the washington post by phone from london on wednesday about the killings and why he spends several million dollars a year financing journalism in russia
translated excerpts of the interview are below
what can you say about the thrust of the journalists investigation and why its important to learn more about russian mercenary forces
vladimir putin likes to say , this isnt the government , these are private individuals.
i concluded that in our case , the situation with these kinds of nontransparent mercenary structures is even more dangerous than it is in general
tomorrow , they can be used to deal with things inside russia using nongovernmental hands
thats why i gave the approval to make this film
how do you see the balance between funding investigative journalism on the one hand and the risks faced by the people carrying out that journalism on the other hand
you know , im an adrenaline junkie myself
my favorite sport used to be rock climbing , because theres not enough adrenaline otherwise
so i understand people who live on adrenaline very well
such people are in demand in a profession as dangerous as investigative journalism
its clear that if they dont find a job in this area , theyll get their adrenaline in other areas
this is a civically beneficial path to fulfillment for people who live on adrenaline
of course , its very important that these people be professionals
before working in the oil industry , i worked as an apprentice at factories for munitions and explosives
this was a profession i liked because it gave me that adrenaline
well , so what someone has to carry out that work
yes , it was also a risk
factories blew up from time to time
well what can you do
what can you do
one must make sure one does all one can to prevent such things from happening
but on the other hand , you can never make sure you are completely safe
how do you explain to people in the west the situation with journalism in russia
i sometimes get the sense that people are surprised when they hear theres any independent journalism in russia at all
im surprised myself , because independent journalism has no economic foundation in russia , because not only do the authorities not support independent journalism at all , but independent journalists know full well that they can be arrested or beaten up even inside the country
theres a lot more risk in independent journalism , and much less money
over there at pro-kremlin publications you get official awards , while over here theyll throw you in jail or even , as we see , kill you
nevertheless , there are enough decent people those who dont want to be over there and are prepared to risk it over here
why do you think the authorities in russia allow independent journalism to be possible at all
those in charge dont want to look like utter monsters , for a variety of reasons
what are they going to do with these people
dont give them money
they dont give them money
beat them up
they already beat them up
what else is there put all of them in prison or kill them all
those in charge , luckily , arent yet psychologically ready for something like that
the authorities could block access to more independent news websites , as they have done with some of yours
as i understand it , they made the decision not to fight what only reaches 5 or 10 percent of the audience because that segment of the audience isnt ours anyway.
but as soon as you get beyond that threshold , theyll try to shut you down or fine or do something else
they are purposely trying to keep independent journalism in this narrow corral
so what influence can journalism have in this context
i remember the situation in the late '80s and early '90s the fall of the soviet union
at some point , a society can erupt , and the demand for such narrow sources of information grows like an avalanche
so its important that they exist
second , you know the russian saying that whats written with a quill cant be cut out with an ax
the people on the other side , in reality , are not that brave
they know perfectly well that what is seen by 10,000 readers or 100,000 readers today can become a huge problem for them tomorrow if the situation changes
thats why , when even rather small news outlets write about something and it gets attention in even a narrow segment of the public , the authorities can get rather sensitive and tuck in their paws
its one of the few ways we can currently influence the situation in the country
will you reconsider how you fund journalism after what happened
i may reconsider my degree of involvement in this
if i continue to do investigative projects and i certainly will i will try to be involved to a greater degree not just in the process of making decisions but also in the process of the ongoing work and risk assessment , and so on
i now have less of a feeling that i can allow myself to transfer the responsibility to anyone else in this
this doesnt mean there wont be risks and there wont be tragedies
but at least ill know that i personally did all i could do and didnt depend on professionals
