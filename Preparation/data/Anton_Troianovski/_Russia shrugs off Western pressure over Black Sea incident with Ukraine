moscow russia shrugged off western condemnation of its capture of three ukrainian naval ships and their crews , moving ahead tuesday with court proceedings against some of the 24 detained sailors
ukraine , meanwhile , prepared to impose martial law in 10 of the countrys 27 regions after the countrys leaders warned of the threat of a russian attack
russian officials , however , brushed aside kievs response as politically motivated alarmism and voiced confidence that moscow would ride out the criticism and threats of deeper sanctions
the united states and the european union have appealed to russia and ukraine to exercise restraint after sundays maritime clash near the narrow kerch strait between mainland russia and crimea , which russia annexed from ukraine in 2014
the regions of ukraine where martial law was set to take effect on wednesday included the azov sea coast as well as its waters
ukraines president , petro poroshenko , told cnn that ukraine may restrict the ability of russians to enter the country during the 30-day martial law period
the country had intelligence , he said , that russia was concentrating large numbers of troops along ukraines borders
we undertake all our efforts to defend and protect our sovereignty.
but a russian deputy foreign minister , alexander grushko , interpreted the western calls for both sides to ease tensions as a signal that even western officials believed ukraine shares some blame
how the azov sea became a flash point between russia and ukraine
in a further sign of russias resistance to western pressure , a court in russian-controlled crimea ordered at least two of the detained ukrainian sailors to remain behind bars until at least jan. 25 on charges of illegally crossing the border , russian media reported
ukraine acknowledged on tuesday that the ships had onboard agents from its sbu intelligence service
russia has claimed the agents were on a mission to stir up a provocation in the kerch strait
ukraine says they were on normal counterintelligence operations for the navy
the u.s. state department on monday had called for the detained sailors to be freed and ukraines ships returned
russias moves indicated the kremlin was confident it would weather western criticism amid a new flash point between russia and ukraine , which has battled separatists in two pro-moscow breakaway regions since 2014
sundays incident and the aftermath amounted to resolve signaling by both russia and ukraine , moscow foreign policy analyst vladimir frolov said
with president trump largely quiet and poroshenko facing a backlash at home over his handling of the crisis , russian president vladimir putin appears to be succeeding in showing his upper hand in the region
it is not.
sundays incident took place as three ukrainian navy ships were trying to pass through the kerch strait
russia claims that ukrainian sailors ignored the instructions of the pilot meant to guide them through the strait and illegally entered russian territorial waters instead
the kerch strait is a critical artery for ukraine , giving the ports in the countrys industrial southeast access to shipping routes to western europe and asia
while russia and ukraine agreed in 2003 on joint oversight of the strait and the adjoining azov sea , russia has been effectively in control of it since its annexation of crimea in 2014
tensions have risen in recent months after russias new bridge between crimea and the mainland limited the kinds of ships able to pass through the strait
western officials say russia is using its naval muscle in the azov sea to squeeze ukraines economy
russia denies the charges and says it continues to abide by the 2003 agreement granting both countries full use of the kerch strait and the azov sea
ukraines foreign minister , pavlo klimkin , told the associated press that he has asked the head of the international committee of the red cross to try to arrange a visit to the ukrainian sailors
