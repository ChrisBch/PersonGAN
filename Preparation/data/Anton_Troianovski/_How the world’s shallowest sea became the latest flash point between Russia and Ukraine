nestled in europes southeast corner is the worlds shallowest sea the azov
it is no more than 50 feet deep and smaller than lake michigan
but its come to bear outsize geopolitical importance because of the territories that bound it ukraine to the west , russia to the east , and russia-annexed crimea to the south
the narrow kerch strait , between crimea and mainland russia , leads from the azov to the black sea , which in turn connects to western europe and to asia via the mediterranean and the suez canal
months of brewing tensions over the use of this sea underpin the latest flare-up in the conflict between russia and ukraine
heres a quick primer to the worlds latest marine flash point
what is the azovs significance
the azov is a lifeline for ukraines industrial and agricultural east , connecting the countrys mines , fields and factories to the world
the ukrainian port city of mariupol and nearby berdyansk on the seas western shore export regional production such as coal , metals , grain and fertilizer
just 60 miles up the coast , the russian port of taganrog is a hub for trade through russias southwest
the azov is also an important fishing ground frequented by russian and ukrainian boats
why have tensions risen
under a 2003 agreement , ukraine and russia took shared control of the azov sea and guaranteed each others ships open access to it via the kerch strait
but when russia annexed crimea in 2014 , it took over both sides of the kerch strait and used that control to build a bridge connecting crimea to mainland russia
the bridges relatively low height limits the kinds of ships that are able to enter the azov sea putting ukraines ports there at a new disadvantage , as radio free europe/radio liberty detailed in august
citing terrorism threats against the kerch strait bridge , russia has also stepped up security patrols and started detaining ukrainian boats
ukraine accuses russia of militarizing the azov sea and harassing ukrainian ships
russia says its defending its sovereign territory and guarding the kerch strait bridge against legitimate threats
what happened on sunday
tensions escalated rapidly on sunday when russia blocked ukrainian navy ships from entering the strait and opened fire , injuring several ukrainians and detaining 24 sailors
the united states called russias actions a dangerous escalation and a violation of international law.
russia says the ukrainian boats had illegally entered russias territorial waters after ignoring the directions of the marine pilot who was supposed to guide the ukrainian ships through the kerch strait
after blocking all access to the azov sea in the immediate aftermath of sundays incident , russia has reopened the kerch strait to civilian ship traffic , according to russian news reports
the 24 ukrainian sailors remain in detention , and russia claims they include ukrainian intelligence service members
in ukraine , meanwhile , president petro poroshenko is under pressure to take a harder line against russia including ripping up the 2003 agreement that provides for shared use of the azov sea by the two countries
signaling that marine tensions will stay high , ukraine on monday night declared 30 days of martial law for 10 regions of the country including the azov sea coast and the waters of the sea itself
