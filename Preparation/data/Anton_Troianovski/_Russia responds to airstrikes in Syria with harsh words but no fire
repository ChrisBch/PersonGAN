moscow in the hours after american missiles rained down on its ally in syria , russia made clear it had no plans to respond in kind
after all , moscow still wields considerable control over the direction of the war
russian officials , including president vladimir putin , described the strike as an act of aggression against a sovereign state carried out on the pretext of a staged chemical attack
at the u.n. security council , russia called on the world to condemn the united states
but there was a second , unspoken message the incoming cruise missiles did not cross the threshold that would provoke a military response against western forces
instead , it appears that the western coalitions limited strikes did little to change the facts on the ground
russia , negotiating primarily with iran and turkey , remains keen to forge a political settlement in syria that would cement a long-term foothold for moscow in the middle east
the united states , with president trumps long-term strategy for the country still uncertain , is left as a less influential player
western powers warn syria another strike is possible
analysts say that putins syria intervention is part of his effort to turn russia into an actor known for asserting its interests on a global scale
russias insistent warnings that a u.s. airstrike could bring russian retaliation and the united states apparent effort to avoid threatening russian assets in its assault showed that strategy at work
but russias backing of assad and contribution to massive civilian casualties in syria , according to western leaders , have taken a toll on the countrys reputation
the syrian conflict was one reason the united states imposed sanctions on members of putins inner circle earlier this month causing the russian stock market and currency to plummet
british prime minister theresa may , speaking saturday about the aftermath of the airstrikes , tied russias support of assad to what she described as a destructive pattern by putin
she referred also to last months poisoning in england of a former russian double agent and his daughter an incident that britain blames on russia
moscow has denied involvement
how did ex-spy sergei skripal and his daughter survive nerve-agent poisoning
russias response saturday underscored putins effort to use syria to help portray himself as a guarantor of global stability despite the torrent of western criticism
he described the u.s. airstrike as the latest in two decades of american-led interventions that , in the kremlins telling , have unwound the international order
but while russia slammed the missile attack rhetorically , it signaled that the strike had not crossed the threshold that would bring russian retaliation
moscows response shows that washington appears to have succeeded in delivering a blow that did not provoke russia militarily
the u.s. ambassador in moscow , jon m. huntsman jr. , said in a video message to russians posted on social media saturday
over the past week , pro-kremlin officials , independent analysts and the state-allied news media described the situation in syria as a uniquely dangerous moment
not for decades , they said , had the united states and russia come so close to a direct military clash
the result , according to the worst-case predictions , could be a new world war
it was palpable , the fear , said vladimir frolov , an independent foreign-policy analyst in moscow
but after the attack , russias defense ministry quickly said that no russian air defenses were deployed against the incoming fire , even though thousands of the countrys troops are stationed across syria
hours later , the russian embassy in damascus said no russians were known to have been hurt in the overnight airstrike
and the defense ministry even noted that while syria shot down some cruise missiles , damascus did so using its own soviet-made not russian-made equipment
the defense ministry said
