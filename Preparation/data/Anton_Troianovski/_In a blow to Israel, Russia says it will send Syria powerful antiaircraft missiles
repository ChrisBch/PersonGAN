moscow russia said monday it would equip syria with sophisticated air defense systems , a move that could worsen a rift with israel by limiting its ability to bomb across its northern border
defense minister sergei shoigu said moscow would send russias powerful s-300 ground-to-air missile systems to syria , a longtime ally , in the next two weeks
israel , which has repeatedly bombed iranian targets in syria , has long opposed such deliveries , and russia up to now has refrained from supplying the weapons
but the downing last week of a russian reconnaissance plane with 15 service members aboard changed the dynamic
the plane was shot down by a syrian missile , but russia faulted israel for the crash because an israeli fighter jet allegedly had used the russian plane as a screen against syrias air defenses
israel , by contrast , said that its air force had not violated any agreements with russia and that israeli jets had already returned to israeli airspace when the missiles were launched
the crash was one of the deadliest incidents for regular russian service members in the syrian war
today , the situation has changed , for no fault of ours , shoigu said in a televised statement monday announcing the s-300 deliveries
shoigu said russia also will jam military aircraft communications in the airspace next to syria over the mediterranean sea while upgrading syrias air defense command systems
russian officials did not , however , signal a desire to fundamentally alter the relationship with israel a key element of the kremlins push to build its influence in the middle east
russian president vladimir putin told israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in a phone call monday that the missile delivery was meant primarily to counter any potential threat to the lives of russian service members , the kremlin said
netanyahu told putin that the transfer of advanced military systems to irresponsible hands would increase the dangers in the region and that israel would continue to defend its security and interests , according to a statement from his office
the leaders agreed to continue dialogue , and netanyahu reiterated his condolences over the deaths of the russian soldiers , it said
the flare-up in tensions between russia and israel marks a turnabout after months of personal diplomacy between putin and netanyahu , in which the two leaders forged a close relationship
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said monday.
everything had worked right up until the tragedy that occurred recently.
putin informed syrian president bashar al-assad about the missile delivery in a phone call monday , according to a statement issued by syrias presidency
if delivered , the s-300s would further shift the military balance in syria in favor of assad and of iran and its allied militia , hezbollah
iran and hezbollah have vowed to maintain a presence in syria , over israels objections , even though the war is winding down
israel has fiercely lobbied russia against providing syria with the s-300 systems
israel flies missions with relative ease over syria , given the latters largely antiquated air defenses , and israeli officials recently admitted that more than 200 bombing raids have been carried out by israeli warplanes inside syria over the past two years
israel says it is determined to stop iran , a longtime foe that has sent forces to back assad , from becoming entrenched near israels northern border
israel also wants to prevent the transfer of advanced missile systems to iranian proxies , including hezbollah , a militant shiite group based in neighboring lebanon
a flurry of shuttle diplomacy by israeli officials to russia appeared to be paying off in may , when russian officials said just days after a visit by netanyahu that they did not plan to sell the s-300 system to syria
more broadly , israel also sees russia as key to protecting its interests in syria by preventing a buildup of iranian-linked bases and infrastructure
the deterioration in relations between russia and israel , along with the promised transfer of the s-300 system , complicates israels efforts to contain iranian influence
