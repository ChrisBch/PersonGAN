pyeongchang , south korea at first glance , russia is shrugging off one of the stiffest penalties in olympics history
russian-born athletes are everywhere at these winter games , zipping down luge courses , jumping off ski ramps , pulling off triple axels
the nation has one of the games largest delegations
it has won five medals
its fans show up to arenas by the hundreds , draped in flags , waving pompoms and tricolor flags , chanting victory at the top of their lungs
but nearly one week into these olympics , the visuals belie the sting
sanctioned for a long-running nationwide doping operation , the russian group is in fact down 64 competitors from sochi in 2014 , cleaved of some of its best athletes
the beloved biathlon team was decimated
the top speedskater is at home
the medal pace is way behind the norm , and when russians do reach the podium , theyre reminded of their bizarre place in these games their anthem , like their flag , is banned in pyeongchang
for russians , these olympics have become two things at once a somber sporting moment but also a chance to project a defiant image to the world
at a time when russias resurgence is redefining global politics , the nation is being humbled in the sports world , though not without a fight
in u.s. womens hockey rout of russians , olympic controversies are put on ice
as part of the penalty set by the international olympic committee , team russia has even lost its name
its athletes are officially stateless , dressed in bland colors , given the designation olympic athletes from russia.
but for some russian media outlets , the olympics-mandated term doesnt get used
team russia is at these olympics
when the global olympic body levied its sanctions in december , it kept open the door to pyeongchang for russians without a proven history of drug use
at the time , no one knew how many athletes would be deemed eligible for the games evidence showed that more than 1,000 russian athletes , across at least 30 sports , had been involved in doping since 2011
athletes who wanted to compete in south korea had to seek exemptions from an anti-doping panel
in the end , the ioc approved 169 olympic athletes from russia
all but one of the approved athletes showed up to pyeongchang
but the severity of the iocs penalties goes beyond delegation size
the country has been stripped of enough medals since sochi to lose its first-place spot in those games retroactively
top athletes such as speedskater viktor ahn , biathlete anton shipulin and cross-country skier sergey ustiugov were barred from pyeongchang
from sport to sport , russian athletes have spoken cautiously about their place at these games
most have said they are just here to compete and dont worry about the ban on their flag or their anthem
but several have spoken to a greater sense of purpose
when semen elistratov won a bronze medal in a short-track speedskating race , he said he was holding back tears
this medal is for you.
in moscow , the olympic ban has been portrayed by top officials as a western-led campaign against a resurgent russia
many russians dont believe that their country engaged in a government-sponsored doping program , an echo of their doubts that russian intelligence agencies interfered in the u.s. elections
in both cases , many russians say that they dont see enough solid evidence and chalk the allegations up to anti-russian attitudes in the united states
shaun white apologizes for letting american flag drag on the ground after winning gold
ahead of the games , some russian politicians insisted the country should boycott the games if its flag was going to be banned in pyeongchang
the debate only calmed after president vladimir putin said he recognized how important the olympics were to athletes who had trained all their lives.
we will not prevent anyone from doing what they want , he said
but after athletes marched in gray at the opening ceremonies , questions flared again as to whether competing without a flag made the games too shameful to participate in
was it really acceptable , a journalist for leading tabloid komsomolskaya pravda asked , that russian athletes were performing under a white olympic flag the flag of surrender
in a december survey by pollster vciom , which is close to the kremlin , 45 percent of russians blamed political forces of other countries for the countrys olympic suspension
another 29 percent blamed russian sports officials
among russians who believe their athletes engaged in doping , many say that other countries do it , too and that russia attracted the ire of western anti-doping enforcers because of geopolitics
said oleg shamonaev , a top editor of sport express , russias biggest daily sports newspaper.
russia is a convenient target.
shamonaev said his websites most-read articles are largely about controversies surrounding the doping scandal
on monday , for instance , russian skeleton racer nikita tregubov said american and british athletes in pyeongchang have been refusing to greet him because theyre set against us politically.
zasport , the official clothing label for this years olympic athletes from russia , is selling i dont do doping sweaters in its moscow flagship store
a store associate said the oar neutral uniforms would be on sale soon
many of those fans have come from eastern russia , including vladivostok , a two-hour flight from seoul
one person said , and the dj cut the music
after a few minutes , medvedeva was done
the music came back on
everybody scattered , and some started talking about russias upcoming hockey game one it would lose in an upset , 3-2
a fan from st. petersburg , nikolay malakhov , 36 , had a ticket
the players would have to wear muted red-and-white uniforms saying olympic athlete from russia , but malakhov planned to sit in a crowd of friends , and he already was wearing his tricolor jersey
the fans we are the flags , he said
