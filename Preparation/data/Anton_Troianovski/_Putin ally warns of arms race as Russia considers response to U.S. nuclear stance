moscow one of russian president vladimir putins closest associates warned in an interview wednesday that the u.s. and russia are approaching a new arms race the latest sign that geopolitical tensions are undermining nuclear arms control
sergey chemezov , a top figure in russias arms industry , said he didnt believe that the new start accord limiting the number of nuclear weapons deployed by the two countries could be renewed in the current political environment
chemezov said in the interview with the washington post
q & a sanctioned putin ally holds out hope that trump will boost russia ties
chemezov is one of the most prominent russians to express skepticism in recent weeks about the prospect for new nuclear arms talks with the united states
with russian hopes dashed that president trump would improve relations with moscow , the russian elite increasingly appears unsettled by his more muscular approach
for russians , a new warning sign came earlier this month with the release of a u.s. defense department document recommending the development of new nuclear arms to counter russia
chemezov heads rostec , a state industrial giant that makes small arms , helicopters , radar systems and other weapons , and that controls russian arms exports
he is also one of putins key associates at the intersection of business and government and a longtime friend
the two served together in the kgb in dresden , east germany , in the 1980s and shared an entryway in a six-story apartment building
chemezov is under u.s. sanctions imposed by the treasury department
it referred to him as a trusted ally of president putin when it announced sanctions against him and several other russian officials in response to the annexation of crimea in 2014
late last month , treasury listed him as one of russias senior political leaders.
echoing senior russian politicians , chemezov said he had been expecting a friendlier u.s. policy toward russia after trump took office
loosened sanctions , chemezov said , would have allowed his company to deepen its business ties with american companies such as boeing , with which it already works to produce titanium airplane parts in russias ural mountains
the foreign ministry in moscow said russia will take measures to enhance our security on the heels of the u.s. nuclear plans
russia is already modernizing its nuclear arsenal , with upgrades to its bombers , missiles and submarines capable of delivering nuclear warheads
as tensions with the united states rise , russian politicians and media personalities have said russias nuclear arsenal ensures that the country will be taken seriously
russian officials are still working to digest the nuclear posture review and to divine trumps interest in arms-control negotiations
for moscow , a key question is how trump will proceed on the new start agreement , which expires in 2021
the treaty , which president barack obama negotiated with then-russian president dmitry medvedev , limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads by each country to 1,550 and institutes an extensive verification regime
the compliance deadline for the new start agreement was monday , and both moscow and washington said they complied with required reductions
the treaty can be extended automatically for another five years if both presidents sign
the united states is concerned that russia is violating other agreements , most notably the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty , and some u.s. officials doubt that washington should sign an extension if other agreements arent holding
