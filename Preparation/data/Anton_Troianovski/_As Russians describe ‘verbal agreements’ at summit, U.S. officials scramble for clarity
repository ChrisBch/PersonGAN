two days after president trumps summit with russian president vladimir putin , russian officials offered a string of assertions about what the two leaders had achieved
antonov also said putin had made specific and interesting proposals to washington on how the two countries could cooperate on syria
but officials at the most senior levels across the u.s. military , scrambling since monday to determine what trump may have agreed to on national security issues in helsinki , had little to no information wednesday
at the pentagon , as press officers remained unable to answer media questions about how the summit might impact the military , the paucity of information exposed an awkward gap in internal administration communications
the uncertainty surrounding moscows suggestion of some sort of new arrangement or proposal regarding syria , in particular , was striking because gen. joseph votel , who heads u.s. central command , is scheduled to brief reporters on syria and other matters thursday
defense secretary jim mattis did not attend wednesdays cabinet meeting with trump and has not appeared in public this week or commented on the summit
white house tries to clarify trumps response to whether russia still targeting u.s. elections
pentagon spokeswoman dana white said
current and former officials said it is not unusual for it to take at least several days for aides to finalize and distribute internal memos documenting high-level conversations
adding to the delay in the case of trumps russia summit is the fact that the presidents longest encounter with putin , a two hour-plus session , included no other officials or note-takers , just interpreters
trump continued to praise his private meeting with putin and an expanded lunch with aides as a tremendous success and tweeted a promise of big results , but state department spokeswoman heather nauert said the administration was assessing
three takeaways , which she characterized as modest.
they were the establishment of separate working groups of business leaders and foreign-policy experts and follow-up meetings between the national security council staffs of both countries
some military officials , accustomed a year and a half into the trump administration to a decision-making process that is far less structured than it was under president barack obama , appeared unfazed by the lack of clarity
unlike obama , who oversaw a national security process that was famously meticulous and often slow , trump has presided over a more fluid , less formally deliberative system
few if any top-level national security meetings , for example , have been held this spring following the administrations attack on syrian military facilities in april , according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations
that shift , while welcome by those frustrated by the pace of decision-making under obama , may provide top military officials less regular access to their commander in chief and fewer opportunities to influence the policy process
branding putin how the kremlin turned the russian president into a global icon
russia has , like syrian president bashar al-assad , defined all opponents of the syrian government as terrorists and made similar proposals throughout the seven-year syrian civil war
while a void remained in u.s. descriptions of the summit , antonov called it important , comprehensive , productive and constructive.
putin is expected to speak about the summit in a speech thursday
antonov said it was very bitter to hear the intense criticism in the united states of the helsinki meeting
he cited trumps reference to investigations of russian election interference as a witch hunt and said russia was a hostage to the domestic political battle in the united states
