helsinki responding to a question here about interference in the 2016 election , russian president vladimir putin distilled his worldview you cant believe anyone.
for once , putin had a western leader standing next to him who rejects his critics in the same way
mondays summit with president trump gave putin a new level of international prestige , especially for the many russians exhilarated by what they see as their presidents success in rebuilding their countrys global influence
it allowed the russian president to avoid the opprobrium of the worlds most powerful country over election interference and other issues that have riled the west
but beyond putins tactical gains , the helsinki meeting highlighted the global ascendance of putins ruthless approach to politics and to facts the posture that any truth can be an illusion , that any journalist or public servant is likely pursuing an ulterior motive
that worldview , driven for years by state-controlled television in russia and by russian officials led by putin himself , has long helped the former kgb agent consolidate power at home and buck western criticism of his regime
it has driven russias international influence efforts , such as on the airwaves of the pro-kremlin television network rt
now that same approach is allowing putin to make common cause with the president of the united states to spurn the determination of american intelligence agencies and deny a u.s. special counsels findings
as for those interference accusations , putin said , this is utterly delusional.
minutes later , trump would echo putin in claiming , i dont see any reason that russia would be behind the hacking of democratic emails
just as putin has long seen a sinister hand behind u.s. state actions , trump declared of special counsel robert s. mueller iiis probe , that was a total witch hunt.
asked how the talks went , russian foreign minister sergey lavrov quipped , fabulous , according to russian news agencies.
better than super.
well before putin and trump sat down at the presidential palace on the shore of the gulf of finland , kremlin allies were celebrating the simple fact that the summit was taking place
even its choreography allowed putin to claim a victory , down to the car that whisked him through helsinkis shuttered streets
after many years of riding in a mercedes , putin on monday climbed into a brand-new , russian-made presidential limousine on its first foreign deployment
putins nonchalant body language during the summit prompted a russian state tv host to note putin looks much more relaxed
trump looks nervous and concerned.
to putin and other russians who have long rejected talk of democratic values and human rights as a facade for furthering u.s. power , trumps lack of interest in such talk has appeared refreshing and advantageous
putin allies have touted trumps pragmatism compared to president barack obama , who often spoke of the need for countries such as ukraine to evolve as democratic societies
putin can use the boost
despite the triumph of the just-ended soccer world cup in russia , putin faces head winds at home because of his governments plan to raise the retirement age
why would trump play into his opponents hands
from the kremlins perspective , however , the project of improving u.s.-russian relations is only beginning
while trumps rhetoric on russia represents a striking departure from his predecessors , american policy has gotten tougher
pushed by congress , the trump administration imposed damaging new economic sanctions on russia and initiated weapons deliveries to ukraine
moscow is hoping for washington to take concrete steps toward rapprochement
putin has called on the united states to move forward on nuclear arms-control negotiations , but trump on monday signaled little progress on the subject
economic sanctions are continuing to pinch russias stagnant economy
in ukraine , u.s. policy remains opposed to russias intervention in the countrys east and the annexation of crimea
