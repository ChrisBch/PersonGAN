leaning against his cherry-colored lada as the sun set over the ural slopes , yevgeny govorov said he knew why the united states had imposed sanctions on his employer , the stalin-era aluminum plant behind him
the kremlins confrontation with the west is increasingly affecting ordinary russians
but few blame president vladimir putin for their woes
even fewer are , for now , prepared to brave the risks of trying to do anything about it
a bumpy two-hour drive from the aluminum factory , on a road through a birch forest , leads to a cemetery with two freshly dug graves
the fighters buried beneath the wreaths of colorful artificial flowers died in a february clash with u.s. forces in syria that russian state media have said next to nothing about
just over a week after u.s. secretary-of-state nominee mike pompeo revealed that a couple hundred russians were killed in that incident , all is quiet in the town of asbest
as putin continues to roll back democracy and russia heads toward a new cold war , the countrys industrial heartland , the urals region , is feeling the consequences and they could intensify
at least a half-dozen factories here belong to aluminum magnate oleg deripaska , a putin ally newly hit with sanctions
an entire town makes a living off titanium sales to boeing
the mayor of the biggest city , yekaterinburg , says the area depends on the economic relationship with the united states but that many of his constituents are in a state of denial
roizman said that a business executive recently complained to him that trade and demand were down
the only bright spot , the executive added , was putins foreign policy , because weve finally shown everyone.
even as both sides speak of a new iron curtain descending between russia and the west , life goes on
the kremlin has deployed russias financial reserves to cushion the blow on regular people , and rising oil prices are helping
russian officials have said they are prepared to step in to aid companies hurt by the latest u.s. sanctions
and the regions most prominent critical voice will soon lose his bully pulpit
roizman , russias best-known elected official who criticizes putin , will leave his post in september because regional pro-putin politicians recently canceled mayoral elections in the city
said konstantin kiselyev , a political scientist and local lawmaker who is critical of putin.
there is little pushing people into the streets.
just 6 percent of russians told independent pollster the levada center last month that they would participate in political protests if they took place the lowest level since at least 2010
to the extent protests happen , they are about calling on the authorities to fix specific problems , such as smelly landfills
in the former soviet republic of armenia , by contrast , street protests toppled the prime minister monday
some local protests have shown results , such as an outpouring of public anger over a mall fire that killed 60 in march in the city of kemerovo and brought about the regional governors resignation
but in those local protests , putin is often seen as someone who can help people solve their problems rather than someone who causes them
meanwhile , on the foreign policy issues that more frequently make headlines in the west from geopolitics to kremlin interference abroad russians are largely on putins side
even though critical news websites are freely accessible in russia and internet access is penetrating the countrys most remote reaches , state-controlled television is just about as influential now as it was five years ago
in a poll last month , 85 percent of russians told levada that tv was one of their main news sources , compared with 27 percent who mentioned the internet little changed from 2013
many russians dismiss accusations against their president as false pretexts for fresh sanctions
news broadcasts describe the poisoning of former russian double agent sergei skripal in england as a crude ploy to harm russia concocted by western intelligence services
only 9 percent of russians told levada that they thought their country was behind the poisoning
this is a conversation in different languages.
the fallout from putins foreign adventures hit home here in february when reports surfaced on social media that russian military contractors had participated in a syrian regime assault and then died in a clash with u.s. forces
yekaterinburg-based news websites confirmed that two of the dead hailed from the nearby town of asbest
the washington post reported that u.s. officials believed that a mercenary force run by business executive yevgeniy prigozhin was behind the assault and that he apparently coordinated it with the kremlin
the state media said little about the incident
dmitry kolezev , deputy editor of the news website znak , which reported on the deaths , said the story drew nationwide reader interest but little local outcry
he explained the relative silence by pointing to the dominance of the state media and said that , four years after the start of the ukraine crisis , people have gotten used to war.
another yekaterinburg journalist who reported on the syria deaths , maxim borodin , died this month after falling from his balcony
u.s. state department spokeswoman heather nauert described it on twitter as the fate of russias journalists who question the kremlin.
roizman said he believed borodins death had nothing to do with his work as a journalist
polina rumyantseva , editor in chief of borodins outlet , novy den , said the publication had conducted its own investigation and did not find evidence of a crime
a representative of the regional investigative committee said the official investigation is continuing
in kamensk-uralsky , where residents are bracing for u.s. sanctions to hit the citys aluminum plant , 24-year-old communist party secretary boris idiatulin said he only had success getting pensioners those with the least to lose out to protests
conditions would have to deteriorate to the point that people truly have no money for a broader swath of the population to seek political change , said idiatulin , who works at a cultural center
idiatulins co-worker mikhail achimov said he blamed putins foreign policy for sanctions against russia , which he says have led to higher prices
beyond boycotting last months presidential election , however , the 35-year-old achimov said he had no interest in trying to make his voice heard
