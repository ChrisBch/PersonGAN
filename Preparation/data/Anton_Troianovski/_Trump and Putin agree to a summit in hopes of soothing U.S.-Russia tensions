moscow signaling a growing rapprochement between the united states and russia , the white house and the kremlin on thursday will announce the date and location of a summit meeting between president trump and russian president vladimir putin
both men have pursued the tete-a-tete in hopes of soothing tensions over russias interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and its aggression in ukraine and elsewhere , despite retaliatory actions taken by both governments this year
plans for the trump-putin summit were finalized here on wednesday by national security adviser john bolton , who held marathon meetings in the russian capital that included talks with putin himself at the kremlin
trump has long sought to cultivate a warm friendship with his russian counterpart as a means to solving intractable problems around the world , and he has said he admires the strength of putins authoritarian rule
bolton said wednesday that trump believes so strongly that now is the time for a new level of personal engagement and that putin agrees
bolton said at a news conference in moscow after his day of meetings.
id like to hear someone say thats a bad idea.
bolton said the summits time and place would be announced simultaneously in washington and moscow on thursday
the summit is expected to take place in mid-july outside russia , during trumps trip to europe for a previously scheduled nato summit meeting july 11-12 in brussels and a visit to britain on july 13
trump said the putin meeting would occur probably after the nato summit , a sequencing that is of particular concern to european allies
there is speculation that trump and putin could meet in helsinki or vienna , but neither u.s. nor russian officials confirmed the location
the president praised the russians for doing a fantastic job hosting the world cup , complimenting the quality of the venues and saying that the matches have been exciting even if you are not a soccer fan.
thomas wright , director of the center on the united states and europe at the brookings institution , said the summit announcement is a sign of trump unbound.
wright said , noting that trump was always a reluctant participant in implementing sanctions and other tough measures against russia
trumps summit with putin threatens to further rupture his relationship with european leaders and is likely to raise additional doubts about his commitment to the united states traditional alliances
it will also garner scrutiny in light of special counsel robert s. mueller iiis ongoing investigation into russias election interference and possible collusion between putins government and trumps campaign
bolton dismissed those concerns while chiding trumps domestic detractors
in washington , trumps critics worry that he might shrink from directly confronting putin on the substantial and serious differences between their countries
they cited not only russias election interference but also its alleged poisoning of a former russian double agent in britain its support for syrian president bashar al-assads government and its occupation of crimea in ukraine
sen. christopher a. coons ( d-del
) , a member of the senate foreign relations committee , said in an interview that a trump-putin summit could be constructive and noted that u.s. presidents regularly met with russian leaders at the height of the cold war
at the kremlin , putin warmly greeted bolton in a grand oval meeting hall , flanked by statues of russian czars set before lime-painted walls
the russian president opened the meeting by repeating to bolton his frequent contention that u.s.-russia relations are in a poor state in large part because of the domestic political environment in the united states
boltons engagement with putin on wednesday contrasted sharply with the longtime hawks harsh criticism of the russian president before he took over as trumps national security adviser in april
last year , bolton described russian interference in the 2016 election as a true act of war and concluded we negotiate with russia at our peril.
john bolton was once a fierce critic of putin
drawing a big smile from the russian president
boltons meeting with putin also included talks on iran , syria and nuclear arms control , officials said
the discussions very briefly touched on allegations of russian election interference , kremlin foreign policy aide yuri ushakov said
bolton said election interference would be part of the conversation when putin and trump meet
asked at his news conference about his prior writings on the matter , bolton said he would not comment on his statements before entering his current job
russian officials have sought a trump-putin summit for months and have blamed u.s. domestic politics for the difficulty in making it happen
trump has also pushed for a meeting with putin despite resistance from senior political aides and diplomats
boltons visit to moscow came as russias energy minister , alexander novak , was in washington this week for meetings with treasury secretary steven mnuchin and energy secretary rick perry , as well as to attend the world gas conference
tass , a russian government-owned news agency , reported that novak discussed gas development and other energy investments by u.s. companies in russia with mnuchin and perry
