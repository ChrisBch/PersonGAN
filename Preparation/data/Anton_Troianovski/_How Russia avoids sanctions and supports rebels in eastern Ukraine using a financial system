an isolated , war-scarred enclave in the caucasus mountains has become a hidden financial crossroads for russias shadow empire around the black sea
the kremlin has for years bankrolled an array of pro-russian breakaway states within the former soviet republics of ukraine , georgia and moldova
for moscow , the goals could not be bigger rebuilding russias influence and countering the regions drift toward the west
the network of semi-states has become so important for russia that an off-the-grid financial system now ties some of them together , bridging hundreds of miles and circumventing international sanctions
a washington post investigation including interviews with business and political leaders uncovered the extensive use of this improvised banking system , which runs through a mountainous patch called south ossetia , a self-declared splinter state in georgia
it works like a relay around the barriers put up by sanctions imposed by the european union , the united states and others spelling out penalties for doing business directly with the separatist territories
separatist officials and business figures in eastern ukraine one of the main moscow-backed breakaway territories in the region transfer money to south ossetia
the funds are wired to russia , officials familiar with the arrangement told the post
the money then pays for goods such as fuel and building materials , which are shipped from russia directly to eastern ukraine , interviews and records show
the arrangement also works in reverse , allowing exports from the separatist territories to be sold in russia
this year alone , more than $ 150 million in payments has been funneled through south ossetia , according to an estimate by the territorys tax office
in a rare visit by a western journalist to south ossetia , the post reviewed documents and conducted interviews that showed how the enclave has quietly become a financial linchpin for moscow
the story of how a caucasus backwater became a kremlin financial hub sheds light on russias opportunistic , low-budget approach to building its foreign influence in the region
on a practical level , south ossetia has allowed russia to create its own rules and discrete financial channels to help sustain separatist economies and sidestep sanctions
the main beneficiary has been the separatists in eastern ukraine the most active flash point around the black sea
south ossetia also serves as a key russian foothold to project staying power
for russian president vladimir putin , the black sea region is among the main arenas as moscow challenges what it views as western encroachment
some of the western-looking governments in the region including georgia , ukraine and moldova have deepened cooperation with nato and hold aspirations of possible formal membership in the future
said ketevan tsikhelashvili , the georgian government minister in charge of conflict resolution with her countrys breakaway territories
with a gross domestic product less than one-tenth of the united states , russia struggles to compete with the west economically even as moscows huge nuclear arsenal and costly military expansion remain key elements of its global ambitions
that economic mismatch means that western sanctions can have an impact and forces russia to be both frugal and creative in trying to work around them
conflict-battered south ossetia also has become an improbable financial gateway over the past three years
about the size of rhode island , it has been the site of two wars between western-leaning georgia and moscow-backed forces since the 1990s
reminders of combat toppled buildings and walls pockmarked by gunfire rest among orchards , springs and mountain valleys
the population of roughly 50,000 largely speaks the native ossetian tongue and maintains its traditions of homemade wine and salty cheese
the kremlin-backed rebel territories in eastern ukraine the self-proclaimed donetsk and luhansk peoples republics are 400 miles to the northwest
and the battles there have no direct impact on life in south ossetia
still , south ossetia is a vital cog for moscows reach into the black sea region
the enclaves murky international status gives russia free rein to set up its own banking system outside the normal rules
while south ossetia describes itself as independent , it relies on russia for its security and for almost all of its budget revenue
georgian officials say that no major decisions are made in the territory without moscows approval
the separate banking system , in turn , serves as a way to sustain the separatist eastern-ukrainian economy as the war grinds on
more than 10,000 people have died in that conflict since 2014 , according to the united nations
sporadic fighting continues between the rebels and ukrainian forces
the financial threads between the kremlin and ukraines separatists pass through a sleek office building on stalin street in tskhinvali , the main city of south ossetia
there , a three-year-old institution called the international settlements bank handles financial transactions with separatist territories in eastern ukraine
russia traded roughly more than $ 150 million in goods with rebel-held territory in ukraine in the first half of this year using south ossetia as the payment center , according to officials and tax records
at least 146 limited liability companies , the south ossetian tax office said , were active this year in facilitating trade with the russian-backed separatist territories
ossetia is essentially like an offshore company , said a lawyer based in the eastern-ukraine rebel stronghold of donetsk who specializes in foreign trade
he spoke on the condition of anonymity because he said he worried about repercussions for describing the system to a western reporter
this scheme , he said , was clearly thought up by some rather sophisticated people.
the arrangement which lawyers , businesspeople and officials described to the post , many also speaking on the condition of anonymity works like a triangle , according to an adviser to separatist leaders in the donetsk region
anytime someone in separatist territories wants to wire money to a company in russia and beyond they do so by way of the international settlements bank in south ossetia
( south ossetia is the only entity that recognizes the eastern-ukraine breakaway regions , making it the only place to have a formal banking relationship with them )
the money is sent onward to russia
( russia recognized south ossetian independence after the 2008 war
that allows russian banks to transfer money to and from south ossetia )
the goods paid for by the transfers including fuel , building materials and food are shipped to eastern ukraine , largely by truck from russia over a shared border
( rerouting cash and trade through south ossetia lets russia avoid the western sanctions and opprobrium it would incur were moscow to officially recognize ukraines separatist republics )
following the money triangle
money from separatist territories in eastern ukraine makes its way to russia via a bank in south ossetia and vice versa
the arrangement fosters trade in goods between russia and the separatist territories despite international sanctions

to be sure , russia sends other aid to the separatists more directly
international monitors surveillance drones in recent months have repeatedly sighted truck convoys traveling at night from russia into separatist territory and avoiding official border crossings
western and ukrainian officials say russia provides the rebels with troops and military and logistical aid
russia denies providing any direct military support
the south ossetian connection provides a more formalized financial link that allows the roughly 3 million people living in the separatist-occupied territories to trade with the outside world
the framework of the system goes back to 2015
that year , the international settlements bank opened on tskhinvalis stalin street
in moscow , meanwhile , another financial institution was formed at almost the same time with almost the same name the center for international settlements
it got a banking license in 2016
and its chairman , vyacheslav mazurin , is a 1981 graduate from the higher school of the kgb an elite training ground for russian spies
mazurin declined an interview request made through a spokeswoman
but lawyers , businesspeople and government officials said that they form the backbone of the sanctions-snubbing financial nexus between moscow and eastern ukraine
south ossetia also gives the kremlin something else a military outpost deep in the caucasus region that was once part of the soviet union
after hostilities between georgia and south ossetia erupted into war for a second time in 2008 , the russian military stepped in and invaded georgia proper
moscow now recognizes the independence of south ossetia and another breakaway georgian region , abkhazia , and strengthened its military presence there
but the kremlins commitment to separatism as statecraft is expensive
russias treasury is sapped by sanctions , an aging population , global military ambition and endemic corruption
of south ossetias $ 120 million in budget revenue last year , $ 110 million came as aid from russia , according to official records
a new bridge connecting annexed crimea to russia cost some $ 4 billion
and russias military intervention in eastern ukraine , along with spending on welfare payments and other assistance to separatist-controlled territory , also amounts in the billions , according to russian media reports and ukrainian government estimates
a green fence , with cameras and motion sensors , runs through abandoned orchards separating south ossetia from georgia proper
the road that once connected georgias capital , tbilisi , to tskhinvali is blocked by barricades and machine-gun nests
on either side , memorials featuring charred remnants of warfare depict the other as the barbaric aggressor
in south ossetia , there are the remains of burned cars
on the georgian side , glass bottles melted from the heat of fires
for south ossetians , the winding drive and two-mile tunnel through the caucasus to russia is now the sole link to the rest of the world
there is no airport
credit cards do not work
imports are so sparse that printed books are a prized commodity
ossetia united with russia and with putin , say letters scrawled in white paint on the road north from tskhinvali
every saturday morning , dzerassa dzhegayeva and three friends wend their way up a steep , dirt path before dawn , hauling a thermos of coffee and a bag of chocolates
they do exercises next to the ruins of a hilltop restaurant destroyed in south ossetias first post-soviet war in the 1990s
the second conflict , in 2008 , killed dzhegayevas brother and father
anatoly bibilov , the president of the separatist government in south ossetia , keeps a white bust of putin and a statuette of the russian president riding a bear on his desk
the memorabilia , he said , was given to him as gifts in eastern ukraine
russian-language outlets such as meduza and kommersant have also reported on south ossetias role in trade with eastern ukraine , but the sheer volume of the funds now flowing between the enclaves has not been previously documented
the south ossetian tax office gave the post a list of 146 registered south ossetian companies likely to be doing business with separatist eastern ukraine
the list indicates that fuel , food and building materials exported from russia into eastern ukraine represented much of the flow of goods
the tax office compiled the list by naming companies that pay corporate income tax but no other types of taxes , such as on property
such companies have no operations in south ossetia and have proliferated in the territory over the past three years , according to tax-office head vladimir kadzhaev
the lawyer in eastern ukraine specializing in international trade said he recognized some of the companies on the list
the companies paid around $ 600,000 in taxes on the profits from revenue of about $ 150 million in the first half of this year , according to the document and interviews with kadzhaev
the revenue total represents an estimate for the overall sum of money funneled between eastern ukraine and russia through south ossetia , according to kadzhaev
the flow of funds is nearly twice what it was last year
in the first six months of 2017 , south ossetian companies doing business with eastern ukraine reported revenue of $ 90 million at the current exchange rate , according to kadzhaev
the company that is the biggest taxpayer on the tax offices list is rtk , initials that are commonly used for the republican fuel co. , an operator of 52 gas stations controlled by the rebel government of the donetsk peoples republic
the records suggest it buys fuel from russia and pays for it via south ossetia
a representative of the fuel companys marketing department said its bosses were unwilling to comment on south ossetias role in their business
they thought the info was too political , the representative wrote in an email
appending a frowning-face emoticon , he added , were scared.
the united states in january imposed sanctions on a south ossetian-registered company called vneshtorgservis for exporting coal out of the separatist territories via russia
kadzhaev and other south ossetian officials said they had no knowledge of the company , and its representatives could not be reached
the south ossetian government is now working to replicate the countrys middleman role to offer trade links to other internationally ostracized territories that are close to russia , said dzhigkaev , the deputy head of the south ossetian chamber of trade and industry
bibilov met with syrian president bashar al-assad in july
south ossetia now plans to open a representative office in damascus
south ossetia also signed business and economic cooperation agreements with crimea earlier this year , and officials from the fellow pro-russian breakaway territories of transnistria and abkhazia make regular visits , according to reports by russian media
we dont fear sanctions.
the growing role of south ossetia in moscows financial outreach to the region creates a quandary for georgia
georgias government , like the west and almost all other governments , considers south ossetia to be russian-occupied georgian territory
but georgian officials indicated they did not want to raise too much of an outcry
georgia still has not restored diplomatic ties with russia , which it severed after the 2008 war
but relations have gradually improved , and a resurgence in russian tourism and trade has pumped much-needed cash into the georgian economy
georgian officials say they are focused on reconciling the population of abkhazia and south ossetia with the rest of georgia
unfortunately , we know about the financial flows from south ossetia to eastern ukraine , said tsikhelashvili , the georgian government minister dealing with the breakaway territories.
but not much can be done at the moment.
in eastern ukraine , the two separatist governments refused to allow the post to visit their territory and declined requests for telephone interviews
the kremlins point man for the breakaway territories in ukraine and georgia is vladislav surkov , a former deputy prime minister who now works as a personal adviser to putin
emails leaked in 2016 by ukrainian hackers showed his office closely involved in how the territories are run , reviewing expense reports from donetsk and draft legislation in abkhazia
at a tskhinvali celebration in august marking the 10th anniversary of russias recognition of south ossetian independence , surkov waxed lyrical on the territorys courage in recognizing the peoples republics of donetsk and luhansk
surkov said , according to russias tass news agency
surkov declined an interview request
just as a post reporter was asking south ossetias bibilov about surkov during an interview in the presidents office in tskhinvali , a beige telephone rang
the phone had no dial or a keypad
it sat next to the putin memorabilia
bibilov stopped the interview mid-sentence
he picked up the phone and then , with an amused expression , mouthed surkov
before stepping out of the office
he came back after several minutes
it was business , he said
