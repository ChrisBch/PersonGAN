simferopol , crimea on the eve of russias presidential election , government television here has been airing segments showing crimeans what they would face if not for russian president vladimir putin rocket fire , grieving women and same-sex weddings
on a political show , the host warns that the west will use any sign of russian weakness due to low turnout to carry out plans to exterminate the russian people
our role is a military one , says yekaterina kozyr , the head of this annexed territorys fast-expanding government broadcaster.
there is a war going on.
in 2014 , as putins capture of this black sea peninsula unfolded , russian troops wearing uniforms without identifying markings seized the dilapidated crimean headquarters of the ukrainian state television broadcaster
four years later , the building gleams , freshly sheathed in gray metal siding
inside the new modern studios , a staff more than double the ukraine-era size is fanning fears of annihilation to boost putin ahead of sundays vote
for all the buzz about kremlin efforts to influence the internet , control of the television airwaves remains central to putins power
nowhere is this clearer than in crimea , where a propaganda machine that russia spent millions of dollars to build over the past four years is now fully deployed to drum up votes
even though putin is assured of a blowout victory , analysts say , the kremlin is seeking turnout as a stamp of legitimacy for his fourth six-year presidential term
in crimea , a place central to putins domestic image as a fearless protector of russian interests , officials see turnout as especially symbolic
they are determined to see it exceed the turnout in crimeas internationally unrecognized referendum to join russia in 2014 , which pro-russian authorities put at more than 80 percent
said grigory ioffe , chairman of the territorys civic chamber.
public opinion in the west will be counting this.
for crimeas state media , that means war war against western spies who they claim would like to use an underwhelming putin election victory to foment unrest
kozyr describes her staff , who were trained by state media specialists from moscow , as informational special forces.
dmitry taran , host of a show called information warfare , says he is both an information specialist and a military man.
he said , referring to the day after the election
is russia dangerous , cold and run by a dictator
heres what russians said
the message on crimean television is , if anything , darker and more conspiratorial than the regular fare on russias national tv
that may be because daily life in crimea is harder than in mainland russia
international sanctions mean that even russian companies are wary of doing business here , and the lack of a road connection to the rest of russia leads to higher prices and more-limited goods
according to crimeas new state media , politics in crimea isnt about material well-being
its about life or death
kozyr , the crimean government broadcasting head , said its her job to remind the locals of that
during the pro-western revolution in ukraine in 2014 , which included radical nationalists , russian media warned of imminent violence against russian speakers and crimeas more than 2 million residents
after russia seized crimea , the state spent more than $ 4 million at current exchange rates to build up the regions state broadcaster , and the regional government continues to provide multimillion-dollar annual subsidies
kozyr , a former morning show host who refers to past ukrainian rule in crimea as an occupation , said she received media-management training in st. petersburg and advice from moscow-based media specialists who flew to crimea
russian state tv engineers helped in outfitting the studio despite procurement difficulties because of western sanctions
crimean information minister dmitry polonsky said in an interview
the putin generation young russians are putins biggest fans
in the converted ukrainian state tv building , storage space that used to hold soviet-era props now houses a 24-hour crimean news channel
the new cameras are japanese , and a coffee table for the morning show includes a built-in heater to keep the hosts drinks warm
two modern mercedes tv trucks assembled in moscow have replaced the ukrainian channels rusting soviet-made van , and a third is on the way
there is now a childrens department , and a family show that emphasizes patriotism and russian history is in development
an independent channel catering to the minority crimean tatar population has been banished from the peninsula , replaced by a state-funded , pro-kremlin version called millet
the independent channel , atr , now broadcasts from kiev and has been urging crimean tatars still living on the peninsula not to vote in sundays election
millet , meanwhile , has been airing a political talk show with a visual style very similar to atr but with the opposite message
ukraine is trying to fight back
last year it erected a 500-foot television tower at the crimean border to transmit ukrainian tv signals into the peninsula and has provided government funding to atr
atr head lenur islyamov describes his operation as an informational cannon shooting at crimea
but he said the russian media campaign is succeeding in creating a feeling of permanence around russian authority in crimea that seems to make a return to ukraine impossible
with no reliable public-opinion polling on the peninsula , the impact of russias media campaign is hard to quantify
protests are suppressed by the authorities and kept off the television screen
occupied territory becomes home turf as putin campaigns in crimea
but when putin came to crimea on wednesday for a campaign stop , the power of russian state media was on display
kozyrs broadcaster deployed both of its new trucks and nine cameras to cover putins rally in the port city of sevastopol , beaming a live feed by satellite to state tv headquarters in moscow
in the crowd of thousands , people repeated the tropes that have long been a staple of russian nationwide state tv and are now amplified by the operation in crimea
the united states wants to destroy russia , they said
anything the west sees as russian aggression is simply russia defending itself
life under russian rule may not be perfect , they said , but if putin hadnt saved crimea from the ukrainian nationalists in 2014 , unimaginable violence would have followed
