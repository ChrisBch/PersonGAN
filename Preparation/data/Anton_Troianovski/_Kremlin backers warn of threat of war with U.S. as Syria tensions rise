moscow in the kremlins telling , this is a country under siege
the united states is considering strikes on russian ally bashar al-assad in syria , prompting ominous speculation among people close to the kremlin that such a move could touch off a wider conflict
one scholar who advises the russian defense ministry even raised the specter of world war iii.
at the same time , u.s. sanctions against top russian business executives wiped billions of dollars off russian stock market values this week , prompting fears that the countrys already stagnant economy could be thrown back into recession
as if to drive the point home , a new article from a top kremlin aide declared that russia must prepare for a century of geopolitical solitude and that its epic journey toward the west was over
russian president vladimir putin and his supporters have for years been casting their country as one that has to rally around its leader and fight back in the face of an increasingly aggressive west
that besieged fortress narrative has now roared back to the forefront in ways not seen since the height of the ukraine crisis in 2014 and russias internationally denounced annexation of crimea
the question now is how russia responds both to the sanctions and to any u.s. strike in syria , where moscow has military forces aiding assads regime
trump says putin shares blame for syrian chemical attack
putin has said little on both topics in recent days
he visited russian scientists tuesday and thanked them for their role in helping develop new russian nuclear weapons
slides in the russian stock market this week showed that fridays u.s. sanctions were the trump administrations most damaging move against moscow so far
the ruble fell to 63 against the dollar , the russian currencys weakest level since december 2016 , and government officials said they were preparing to take steps to stabilize the russian businesses affected
deputy prime minister arkady dvorkovich said tuesday
sanctioned businessman oleg deripaskas company rusal , an aluminum giant that employs 62,000 people worldwide , has lost more than half its stock market value since the sanctions were announced
sberbank , russias biggest bank , has lost some 15 percent on the stock market this week even though it was not sanctioned
mondays plunge of more than 8 percent in the benchmark moex russia index was the worst since march 2014 , when russia annexed crimea , though the index recovered some of those losses tuesday
trumps rebuke of putin resets tone from white house
said economist alexandre abramov , a financial-markets expert at moscows higher school of economics
the risk , he said , is that investors will shun all russian company stocks , fearing further sanctions
even as russia reeled from the blow to its economy , another crisis was deepening in syria
the suspected chemical attack in rebel-held douma brought dire predictions in moscow that disaster could follow if washington launched airstrikes in response
russia denies that its syrian allies used chlorine or other agents in the saturday attack , which claimed dozens of lives
the west says overwhelming evidence points to assads forces , with their backers russia and iran sharing responsibility
igor korotchenko , a russian military scholar and a member of the defense ministrys public advisory council , said a u.s. attack that killed russians in syria would compel a military response , potentially against a u.s. plane or ship
that could bring about a chain of events as dangerous as the cuban missile crisis in 1962 , korotchenko said , and potentially provoke world war iii.
opinion why trump must drive putin crazy
russian general staff chief valery gerasimov said last month that russia had information that the united states was planning to fake a chemical attack in syria and use it as a pretext for a strike on assad
if such a strike endangered russian lives , he warned at the time , russia would respond by hitting the missiles and their launchers
lawmaker igor morozov said on a state tv talk show monday
representatives of the syrian arab red crescent , as well as russian specialists , have visited the site of the douma incident and found no trace of any use of chemical weapons , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said tuesday
he said russia would propose a u.n. security council resolution later tuesday that would call on international experts from the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons to visit the site , at the invitation of the syrian government
syria and russia , he said , would be prepared to guarantee the inspectors security
if the west rejected the russian proposal , lavrov said , this would be further evidence of its anti-syrian and russophobic line.
amid the fast-moving developments , a longtime architect of putins rule , kremlin aide vladislav surkov , this week published an article in the journal russia in global affairs that presented a theoretical foundation for the estrangement between russia and the west
