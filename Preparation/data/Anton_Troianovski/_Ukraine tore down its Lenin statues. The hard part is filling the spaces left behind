four angels and the virgin mary mark the spot where the communist used to stand
we used to get drunk next to the lenin , a 45-year-old mechanic named volodymyr said as he passed by
now its a sin to drink there , i guess , his friend yulia said
five years after the start of ukraines pro-western revolution , the once-ubiquitous figure of vladimir lenin has been eradicated by law
so have other symbols of the soviet era gone from the countrys squares , streets and buildings
but ukrainians are still searching for meaning and identity in the spaces left behind
depending on where you look , those spaces are now an empty pedestal
or replaced by a wooden cross
or a new plaque on a rock
or fresh tiles
or just a circle of bare earth
as elsewhere in the former soviet union , the likeness of bolshevik leader lenin remained the focal point of hundreds of towns and villages for years in ukraine after communisms demise
then came the protests , starting in november 2013 , that toppled ukraines moscow-friendly government touching off russias annexation of crimea , the war in eastern ukraine and a race by the new authorities in kiev to erase all vestiges of soviet rule
the ensuing decommunization laws spelled out scores of historical figures , mottos and symbols to be deleted from public spaces
but they didnt say how toppled statues should be replaced
analysis century later , russia still revising story of imperial familys slaying
volodymyr viatrovych , head of the ukrainian institute of national remembrance , which helped write and implement those laws , says all known lenin statues on ukrainian government-controlled territory have now been dismantled more than 1,300 since the decommunization laws were passed in 2015
one exception monuments near the site of the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster
what remains , he acknowledges , are hundreds of empty spaces and pedestals , often in towns central squares
in the institutes internal jargon , the vacancies are known as stumps.
our views of our history are still being formed.
ukraines search for new symbols to replace its lenins reflects the countrys larger struggle to reorient itself toward the west amid economic turbulence and the continuing war with russian-backed separatists in the east
government proponents say ukraine needs to free itself from russias sway by embracing and developing a national narrative and national heroes
critics say that the government is ceding too much power to far-right nationalist groups and enforcing an official ideology just as the soviets did
said ievgeniia moliar , a kiev activist and art historian critical of the governments hard-line approach to decommunization
she sees an unflattering parallel in ukraines new monuments rising on the very spots sometimes on the very same pedestals where lenin used to stand
ukraine like much of central and eastern europe was already bringing down many of its lenin and soviet statues in the 1990s
but the push to remove the rest after the 2014 revolution was remarkable in its legally mandated scale and speed
moliar , who has tracked lenin replacements across the nation , says the most common genres are the religious and the patriotic
in the central ukrainian city of bila tserkva , frozen-dumplings magnate liudmyla drygalo thought of both
she and fellow activists created a makeshift memorial to ukrainians who died in the 2014 protests and the war in the east and erected a wooden cross to stand in lenins place
far from former soviet union , a place where a communist can still dream
locals say they still refer to the spot as where lenin used to be.
the city issued a call for proposals last month to rebuild the square entirely
another popular lenin replacement has been taras shevchenko , ukraines national poet
the 19th-century figure repeatedly passed through on his way to nearby kiev , says a plaque on a rock installed in place of a bust of lenin in the village of ksaverivka
i never heard of him stopping here , said tatyana , the head of the community center in whose parking lot the lenin used to stand sentry.
he just passed through.
the community center run by tatyana she refused to give her last name because she feared retribution from authorities used to be called the house of culture of the friendship collective farm
the letters spelling out collective farm were pried off the facade last year , but the word is still legible because of the different-colored paint underneath
moliar argues that attempts to remove communist terms and symbols often end up drawing more attention to them
in kiev , a tall black pedestal that says lenin still overlooks one of the citys central squares
the figure on top was toppled amid the 2013 protests , but the stone pedestal proved more difficult to move
viatrovych says it should end up in a museum
as they replace their lenins , some villages are considering the fragility of ukrainian politics and hedging their bets
in kodaky , south of kiev , one villager wanted to erect a monument to the people killed in the 2014 protests in kiev , referred to as the heavenly hundred
the village authorities instead put up a more neutral monument to the heroes of independent ukraine in the park next to lenins former spot
kodakys lenin statue sold to collectors for roughly $ 5,000 , money that officials say went toward new windows for the school
all that marks the spot is a 7-by-7 grid of gray paving stones that are less weathered than the rest
kaharlyk , a town of 14,000 an hours drive south of kiev , got a more creative lenin replacement a giant egg , painted with a flower design and a window , that an area businessman installed for easter in 2014
city officials complained the businessman was unwilling to pay for maintenance of the egg
it was finally removed earlier this fall , leaving behind a circular patch of dirt on top of a grass mound
it faces a giant ukraine above all else
placard that covers up a hammer-and-sickle mosaic on the soviet-era house of culture
soon , mayor oleksandr panyuta pledged , the house of culture will be renovated and the mosaic boarded over
a fountain will be built where lenin used to stand
but itll take decades longer , deputy mayor oleh purii said , for the soviet legacy to be banished for good
