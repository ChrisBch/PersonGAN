moscow europes top human rights court ruled thursday that russian arrests of anti-corruption activist alexei navalny have been politically motivated , delivering a broad-ranging if mainly symbolic rebuke of the kremlins methods of keeping domestic opposition at bay
the upper chamber of the european court of human rights said seven arrests of navalny from 2012 to 2014 violated his rights and appeared to be part of a broader effort to bring the opposition under control.
the court ordered russia to pay navalny about $ 72,000 in damages and expenses and called on the country to extend greater legal rights to people protesting peacefully
the russian government had no immediate comment
even though russia is one of the 47 countries within the courts jurisdiction , it has found ways to avoid following the courts rulings in the past
nevertheless , the ruling was significant and more far-reaching than many of the courts past decisions against russia
it endorsed the position of navalny , perhaps russian president vladimir putins most vocal and well-organized critic inside russia
and unlike a lower chamber that delivered an opinion last year , the court found navalnys arrests to be politically motivated
said a news release announcing the verdict
navalny referred to the ruling as a big victory.
he said he had expected a narrower decision that did not determine his arrests to have been politically motivated
navalny has spent more than four months in total behind bars in the past two years , serving 30 days or less at a time , largely on charges of organizing unpermitted protests
analysts say that such arrests allow the kremlin to disrupt navalnys efforts to build anti-putin sentiment while avoiding the public outcry that would ensue if he were sentenced to a longer jail term
navalny , who has built a large online following with viral videos spotlighting corruption in russias ruling elite , was barred from running in the presidential election this year
but he has built a nationwide network of campaign offices able to organize protests across the country , including rallies in september against putins unpopular plan to raise the retirement age
