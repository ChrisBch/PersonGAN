sevastopol , crimea on a streetside bench in the dark as crowds filed by , a 58-year-old woman wednesday was watching a video she filmed on her cellphone , reliving a fleeting moment a campaign event by vladimir putin
i would have loved to see more of him , galina gomozova said
we understand that he is busy , her sister lyudmila gomozova , also 58 , chimed in
the same day that the russian president was the focus of international outrage over the chemical attack on a spy in britain , putin came to the site of another event that drew western furor crimea
posters across the city touted wednesdays rally and concert , marking the fourth anniversary of what people here rarely refer to as russias annexation of crimea
nationally known musicians took turns crooning patriotic songs pop singer vika tsiganova premiered a new one simply called russia.
a prominent mural in the city shows putin steering a ship with the caption heres to returning to the home port
but if anyone was expecting a rousing speech from putin about patriotism and unity after thousands of supporters waited for hours in a central square to see him , the president had other plans
he spoke for two minutes
i am sending you all hugs , putin concluded.
see you soon.
putin has shown little interest in campaigning , even though the state is investing millions of dollars in raising awareness of sundays vote
there are presidential debates on national television , but putin doesnt participate in them
would-be campaign events like wednesdays further highlight the incongruity of russias democratic-in-appearance but autocratic-in-fact political system
while the government sometimes goes to great lengths to boost and solidify support from the public at large , putin himself often acts as though he doesnt need to
nearly all of the world still recognizes the peninsula of crimea , home to about 2 million people and legendary cliffs and beaches , as part of ukraine
ukrainian president petro poroshenko called putins visit to crimea on wednesday an extremely dangerous provocation , according to news reports
but for putin , this was home turf
many locals , who are predominantly russian speakers , looked to him as a savior in early 2014 amid reports in the russian news media that the pro-western revolution in kiev was a fascist , anti-russian coup
on wednesday , he repeated that the referendum in favor of joining russia that was held on the peninsula in march 2014 represented real democracy even though it was held after russian military forces had already taken control of the region
four years after the annexation , residents of crimea grouse about higher food prices and limited commercial services because of international sanctions
many still hold out hope that the situation will improve , in particular if a new multibillion-dollar bridge to connect crimea with the russian mainland opens by the end of the year as planned
putin toured the construction site before wednesdays rally and , as tv cameras rolled , encouraged construction workers to hurry up and finish by may instead
but the most important argument for joining russia , putins backers say , is that civil war or even mass murder of russians would have been the alternative
one of the sisters on the streetside bench after the rally , lyudmila gomozova , said it was putin who kept nato out.
said olga boychenko , 35 , a shopkeeper.
were not being bombed , and were not being cut down.
boychenko , who lives in a resort town four hours away , said she rode to the rally in a convoy of three buses organized by the ruling united russia party
there was little concern for russias growing international isolation in the crowd , let alone the consequences of britains allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian spy sergei skripal
