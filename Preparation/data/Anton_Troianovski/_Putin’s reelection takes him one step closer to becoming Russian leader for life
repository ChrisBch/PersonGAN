moscow with his reelection , vladimir putin took one step closer to becoming russian leader for life
on paper , putins victory gave him a new six-year term as president
but some of his most visible allies quickly signaled that they saw it as a mandate for something greater than that leader of the russian people , rising above politics at a time when the countrys very existence is threatened by an aggressive west
margarita simonyan , the editor in chief of pro-kremlin network rt , wrote that putin had turned from president to our leader , or vozhd a word with medieval roots that was applied to joseph stalin in the soviet era
vladimir zhirinovsky , a nationalist presidential candidate who supports putin , predicted on national television that these elections were the last ones.
and a parade of pro-kremlin commentators , politicians and officials claimed that the 65-year-old putins victory represented nothing less than the unity and determination of a people under siege
said konstantin gaaze , an independent political analyst
russias constitution would bar putin from running again in 2024
but for months , theres been growing speculation in moscow that putin will either change the constitution to allow him to run again or create a new office that would turn him into a supreme national leader , like irans ayatollah ali khamenei
in the wake of sundays election , in which the government said putin won 77 percent of the vote with 68 percent turnout , that speculation has burst into the open
alexey chesnakov , a former kremlin adviser turned pro-kremlin commentator , said he was sure that putin wont go anywhere in 2024.
on a state television talk show sunday evening , zhirinovsky said that because voters seem uninterested in electing a different leader , we should get rid of elections.
the growing talk of a putin lifetime presidency is being accompanied by increasingly dire rhetoric about russias confrontation with the west
putins allies are presenting his victory which was accompanied by footage of ballot-stuffing and many reports of people ordered to vote by their employers as a response to western aggression
international fury over the poisoning of former russian spy sergei skripal in england , these allies say , is only the latest in a series of western attempts to keep russia down
olympic doping , syria , ukraine , hacking and allegations of election interference all fall into that category , too
that russians have against the west
komsomolskaya pravda said.
and this will be the will of the people.
one of the most striking responses , however , came from rt editor simonyan , who deployed a term for putin that has rarely been heard here despite his years-long dominance of russian politics
in referring to him as russias vozhd , she was resurrecting a word for leader that was last commonly used in the country to refer to stalin
in the days of serfdom , it was used in the sense of master.
putin brushes away talk about his future
when a reporter asked him sunday evening if he planned to run again , putin responded that the question was somewhat ridiculous.
