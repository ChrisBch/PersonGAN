moscow a group of russian military contractors died in a u.s. airstrike in syria last week , people who knew two of those killed said tuesday , signaling the beginning of a potentially dangerous phase in the crowded theater of war in the middle east
the incident appears to be the first publicly known case of the u.s. military firing on and killing russians fighting on behalf of syrian president bashar al-assad
neither washington nor moscow officially confirmed the deaths
and the kremlin , rather than using the incident to fan anti-american feelings , sought to play it down
the united states described the feb. 7 airstrike southeast of the city of deir al-zour as a counterattack after an unprovoked assault by pro-government forces on a base where u.s. troops were operating in support of local partner units
one u.s. official said that the american-led coalition was in regular contact with russian counterparts before , during and after the attack and that no regular russian service members were believed to have been killed
beyond russias official military engagement in syria backing the regime , an unknown number of russian mercenaries are fighting as part of assads army
in recent days , rumors swirled online in russia that large numbers of those military contractors had perished under american fire
the contractors have been active in syria since the kremlin began its intervention in september 2015 , according to russian news reports
on tuesday , two russians told the washington post that people they knew were among the dead
russian news media reported that the deaths of several other military contractors have been confirmed , as well
i know he didnt die alone , said alexander averin , a spokesman for the far-left other russia party , describing the death in syria of party member kirill ananyev
averin added that it was a fact that other russians also died , according to his sources in syria
in the baltic sea city of kaliningrad , a local cossack conservative group also reported losing one of its own , vladimir loginov , in the attack
group leader maxim buga said loginov , a sapper by training , departed last fall to help the syrian army clear mines
he said loginov had years of experience in chechnya and a humanitarian mission in eastern ukraine under his belt
analysts are increasingly concerned that the conflict in syria could spill well beyond its borders , given the number of powers engaged in the country
just this month , israel , russia and turkey have had aircraft shot down over syria
briefing reporters by video at the pentagon , lt. gen. jeffrey harrigian , who heads air forces central command , said deconfliction conversations between the u.s. and russian militaries in syria continued on a daily basis
he described the interactions as professional.
but he repeatedly declined to specify who was killed in the feb. 7 airstrike
president trump and russian president vladimir putin spoke by phone monday , but neither side publicly mentioned syria as a subject of their call
the united states initially said that about 100 pro-government fighters were killed in the feb. 7 counterattack
in moscow , officials said none of them were russian service members
russian news media confirmed the deaths of several mercenaries in addition to ananyev and loginov , based on interviews with people who knew them , and speculated that the number of russians killed may have exceeded 100
that would be more than double the 44 russian service members who the government says have been killed in action in syria since october 2015
but the kremlin , which has been quick to play the anti-american card in the past , was more circumspect
putin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters tuesday in response to a question about the russian deaths
vitaly naumkin , perhaps russias most prominent syria expert , also urged restraint in a news conference at the valdai discussion club
moscows reticence on the matter underlines a key kremlin balancing act preventing anti-american sentiments stoked daily on russian state television from getting out of hand
vladimir frolov , an independent moscow foreign policy analyst , said putin was looking for calm ahead of the presidential election next month , in which he is expected to win a fourth term
it wants this story to die asap.
