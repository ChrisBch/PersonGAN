all of the soccer fans were in russia for the first time
nick skinner , one of the australians , hadnt told his mother
the once-every-four-years soccer world cup the most-watched sports tournament on the planet starts on thursday in the worlds biggest country
despite calls for a boycott , cost overruns and security jitters , it could become russias biggest-ever international event
russia is about to come face to face with the world , on a scale both intimate and grand
svetlana , a retired fire-emergency communications engineer from russia , had a question for the migration lawyer from canberra who was sitting across from her and sipping vodka out of a traditional russian tea glass
do you want president putin of australia
no
said the lawyer , nicholas houston.
where is the democracy
a successful world cup would be sure to augment russian president vladimir putins global prestige , as the kremlin works to shed the international isolation ushered in by the ukraine crisis in 2014
but britain and iceland have announced their government officials will boycott the competition
human rights watch has called it the world cup of shame because of russias support for the assad regime in syria
ukrainian officials have urged the world to stay away
nevertheless , more than half of the 2.4 million tickets sold for the world cup have gone to non-russians , including some 90,000 to fans from the united states more than any other foreign country
said daniel futcher , 41 , a travel agent from australia
the westbound train wove past goats and cows , swamps and streams , wildflowers of orange and lavender and rail cars of lumber and coal
it traveled slowly enough that you could pick out the finely cut trim of shutters of passing wooden cottages
the sky glowed blue
bits of crooked wooden fencing stuck haphazardly and illogically out of the lush grass
by the third day of the journey , kensuke utsumi had already learned that train passengers fill up bottles with hot water to take showers in the restrooms , packing shampoo and a towel like going to a hot spring.
he could say ya lyublyu futbol i love soccer , as well as ya ne lyublyu vodka a slightly mangled version of i dont like vodka.
danil serov , an internet marketer for chinese natural-health supplements , had already taught utsumi the quintessential russian long-distance-travel card game called durak , which means fool.
the 40-year-old utsumi fell in love with soccer watching his fathers tapes of the 1986 world cup
he quit his job on the first day of the 2002 tournament to backpack across japan as it co-hosted the event
he still remembers the angel who came to him at the train station in his home town of kobe a woman who asked him for directions to the stadium and turned out to have an extra ticket to see belgium play brazil
sixteen years later , utsumi runs a language-learning travel agency and is a world cup veteran , having visited each of the three tournaments since
in one pocket of his red camouflage cargo pants , utsumi has a white and red hachimaki headband , a japanese flag and a foldable fan at the ready
the australians and other foreigners would board the train after making a connection in irkutsk , still ahead
up to that point , utsumi had had practice separating unpeeled siberian pine nuts with his teeth , but he had yet to meet another world cup traveler
the easternmost of russias 11 match host cities , yekaterinburg , still lay some 2,000 miles and three time zones away
some of the passengers said they were taking the train because the crush of tourists had made it too expensive to fly
a litany of complaints followed from yevgeny and fellow riders about poor roads , poor pensions and low wages in russia
the government was pouring untold sums into ukraine and syria without taking care of its own
yevgeny said he would try to move to america if he could speak english
serov , fresh from a round of durak with utsumi , hopped over onto the bunk next to him
everyone is used to complaining , serov said.
but no one wants to change anything.
there was an awkward silence
the three australians boarding at irkutsk were recovering from what skinner called a blinder of a night sampling the citys actually really good craft beer selection
three argentines boarded having lost their yerba mate vessel and were now sipping their tea out of a glass
wang gang , 40 , was perusing his smartphone outside the sleeping area of his third-class car
the sales and marketing employee for an educational newspaper in shanxi province in china was hoping to get tickets to see his favorite team , germany their will is very strong
theyre very cold
he gave three reasons for wanting to visit russia its literature , its architecture , and its culture of alcohol.
there were , in fact , few signs of drunkenness on the train other than in the dining car , which was mainly frequented by a few all-day beer drinkers
got the money transferred
malyshkin yelled over the din as he slid open the door between cars on his way to the diner.
it wasnt stolen
i think so , utsumi answered.
i survived two earthquakes.
the young men from argentina , who had met on a work-and-travel program in australia , brought their own wine and snacks to the dining car and were promptly shooed out by the waitress , who then asked if all americans were that rude
the argentines were unfazed
they had already spent several days at lake baikal , where they said their vision of russians as cold and distant had been dispelled
martin graffigna , 26 , displayed the evidence on his smartphone a video of what looked like an impromptu dance party in a general store
one of his friends had been trying to talk to a woman in the store when her male companion appeared
the argentines thought this meant trouble
but then , graffigna recalled , the man seemed to ask the shopkeeper to turn on latin music , brought over beers , and said , welcome to russia
a few times a day , the train stopped at a station for a long enough time that travelers could go outside
the usual ritual is to stand around , buy snacks and smoke
the argentines added something else a soccer ball
when a kick overshot the group at the busy krasnoyarsk train station , utsumi sent it back with a header the ball slicing miraculously parallel to the parked train without hitting a window or disappearing under the car
passersby stopped to watch
a pair of policemen on patrol walked past without a word
a conductor abandoned her post at the door of the train car , walked toward the group , pulled out her smartphone and started filming
