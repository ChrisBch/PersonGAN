helsinki president trump handed russian president vladimir putin an unalloyed diplomatic triumph during their summit here monday as he refused to support the collective conclusion of u.s. intelligence agencies that russia had interfered in the 2016 u.s. presidential election
the gathering along the glistening waterfront of this nordic capital turned into a clear political victory for the russian president , who aims to expand his countrys global influence by sowing discord within the united states and disrupting western alliances
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov called the summit fabulous and better than super , according to russian news agencies , while putin spokesman dmitry peskov was snickering with exuberance as he watched the news conference from the sidelines
trump and putin spent their first two hours speaking alone , joined only by their interpreters
after emerging from the tete-a-tete with the former kgb agent , trump appeared to discount the findings of his own intelligence agencies about russias behavior
both presidents are highly focused on projecting dominance and machismo , but trump on monday waffled beside a stone-faced putin and avoided a confrontation when an associated press reporter asked trump whether he believes u.s. intelligence officials or putin
trump declined an invitation by the ap reporter , jonathan lemire , to warn putin , with the world watching , never again to interfere in a u.s. election
after being told of russia indictments , trump still aspired to be friends with putin
trumps failure to confront putin drew stern rebukes from leaders of both political parties in washington and left the american national security establishment alarmed and dismayed
director of national intelligence daniel coats responded by stating that the intelligence assessment of russias ongoing , pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy has been clear and has been presented to trump in an unvarnished and objective fashion
former cia director john o. brennan tweeted that trump proved himself to be wholly in the pocket of putin and that his comments were nothing short of treasonous.

as trump returned to washington aboard air force one , the president took to twitter to defend his performance
wrote the president , who has remained fixated on the exploits of his campaign two years ago
for three straight days leading up to the summit , trump vented on twitter and stewed in private with advisers over the indictments of a dozen russian intelligence officers
the probe , overseen by mueller , has produced charges against or guilty pleas from 32 russians and americans , including charges against former trump campaign chairman paul manafort , who is in jail
discussing the investigation here monday with putin at his side , trump insisted that there had been no coordination between his campaign and moscow , using as his argument that he had no relationship with putin at the time
trump went on to air many of his pet grievances , including unsubstantiated conspiracy theories familiar to his campaign rally crowds and twitter followers
in the morning hours before the summit began , trump said his own country , rather than russia , was to blame for the hostilities between their two nations
although most u.s. officials fault russias election interference , its alleged use of a nerve agent on british soil and its aggression in ukraine and syria , trump instead faulted u.s. foolishness and stupidity in a tweet
the russian foreign ministrys official twitter account retweeted it and added , we agree.
after sitting down with putin , trump said relations had warmed and putin agreed
in a show of bonhomie , putin , who hosted the world cup soccer tournament that concluded sunday in moscow , handed trump a souvenir soccer ball.
now the ball is in your court , putin said
the united states , canada and mexico will jointly host the world cup in 2026 , after qatar in 2022
trump tossed the ball to first lady melania trump , who was sitting in the front row at the news conference , and said they would give it to their son , barron , 12
the trump-putin summit began later than originally planned , after the perennially tardy russian president arrived in helsinki well behind schedule , keeping trump waiting
their one-on-one meeting lasted about two hours , a half-hour longer than anticipated
putins helsinki showmanship starts with his limo
helsinki , which sits across the gulf of finland from putins hometown of st. petersburg , has hosted past diplomatic breakthroughs between american and russian presidents because of finlands stance of political neutrality
although a member of the european union , finland is not part of nato
but mondays summit here produced no such breakthrough
trump and putin said they discussed a range of issues including the civil war in syria as well as terrorism and nuclear disarmament but announced no substantive agreement at the conclusion of their discussions
heading into the summit , u.s. officials said the meeting itself was a deliverable , and trump said there would be future talks between the two presidents and their delegations
