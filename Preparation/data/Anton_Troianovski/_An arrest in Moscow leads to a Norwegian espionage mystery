frode berg volunteered in a soup kitchen in rural russia
he helped organize an annual cross-border festival and ski race
his congregation supported a new church in a russian town just over the boundary line that divides east from west
then the russians arrested him and accused him of being a spy
that an espionage mystery is unfolding here on the arctic frontier confounds residents who didnt expect to be swept up in the confrontation between russia and the west
on the snowbound shore of an icy fjord , a three-decade experiment in building cross-border ties independent of geopolitics now hangs in the balance
no one in this barents sea port town , a 15-minute drive from the russian border , seems to know why the police arrested berg , a 62-year-old retired border inspector , near moscows red square in december
his lawyers say berg stands accused of mailing envelopes with cash and spy instructions addressed to a moscow woman named natalia and now faces a virtually certain espionage conviction
the case has received scant international attention , in part because the norwegian government has resisted the entreaties of bergs friends to bring more public pressure to bear on the kremlin
but it has jolted kirkenes , where residents say that berg personified this remote regions efforts to foster bonds even after geopolitical tensions spiked in recent years
did russian spies set up berg to provoke an international incident with norway , a front-line member of the north atlantic treaty organization
did norwegian intelligence use berg as an unwitting courier in an operation gone wrong
or in a scenario that bergs friends categorically rule out did he truly lead some kind of double life
on friday , a moscow judge extended bergs jail term for an additional three months as russias investigation of him continues
after the hearing , as norwegian journalists lobbed questions at him , berg gripped the bars of his courtroom cage and insisted he had been trapped
i feel really misused , berg said , referring to unidentified people in norway who his lawyers say gave him the envelopes to mail.
i have been fighting against hate and anger.
for now , the only thing that seems clear is that not even kirkenes liberated by the soviets from the nazis in 1944 and part of a russia-norway visa-free zone can escape the confrontation between russia and the west
schoolteacher robert nesje realized that last weekend when he was keeping the time at a friendly russian-norwegian swim meet and thought of his close friend berg imprisoned at the same moment in moscows high-security lefortovo prison
the regions coordinator for international affairs , tatiana bazanova , said berg participated everywhere and in everything when it came to cross-border projects and that his case could cast a shadow on all of them
berg came to kirkenes on the front line of the original cold war as a military officer in 1975
weekly , he drilled in preparation for a soviet invasion , training in the use of defensive fire on tanks and helicopters , he recalled in an interview last year for an art project about the border region
he switched to the border commission in 1990 , and in the ensuing quarter-century lived western hopes for a closer relationship with russia
he went out on joint patrols with russian counterparts and ate and fished with them after meetings
he helped arrange an annual ski race for russians , finns and norwegians passing through the normally off-limits border strip
after he retired in 2014 , he joined the board of a kirkenes art organization , pikene pa broen , that focuses on cross-border exchange
the efforts of berg and others pushing for closer ties paid off
russian fishing and oil firms flocked to the kirkenes port and shipyards , and russian shoppers sought out cheap diapers and other western goods
an agreement allowing visa-free travel for residents near the border came into force in 2012
border crossings surged from around 2,000 a year in 1990 to a high of 320,000 in 2013
daily buses now run between kirkenes and russias northern port city of murmansk
travelers wind past russian military bases hidden in the hills and snow-sheathed barbed-wire fences that , in late january , are bathed in the pink light of the arctic afternoon
according to the official line in moscow , it was all a lie
bergs version of the story , according to his lawyers , is that an oslo acquaintance introduced him to another norwegian who asked him to take 3,000 euros in cash to moscow in december and send it to someone named natalia
on dec. 5 , when berg was on his way to the post office with the cash , russian authorities arrested him
bergs norwegian lawyer , brynjulf risnes , is trying to find out whether the men who sent him were spies , and if so for whom
they could have been connected to norwegian intelligence , he says , or they may have been part of a russian plan to entrap berg and provoke an international incident
said bergs russian lawyer , ilya novikov , referring to russias security agency , which is investigating berg
novikov said that even though his client maintains his innocence , bergs best hope was to be traded for russian spies in custody in the west
a norwegian foreign ministry spokesman said that diplomats were working to safeguard bergs interests but that he wasnt at liberty to discuss details of the case because of norwegian confidentiality rules
the lawyers say berg denies knowing that the envelopes he was carrying contained spy instructions
they say that the fsb has accused berg of being merely a one-way courier , who learned no russian secrets
but the russian state news media said berg stole secrets on russias northern fleet and suggested that pretty much any foreigner who takes a great interest in russia can not be trusted
russian counterintelligence agents should keep an eye out for foreigners who are too passionately in favor of developing relations with russia , a national-security expert interviewed on state television said about the berg case
relations between russia and norway , a founding nato member , have grown more tense as europes far north has re-emerged as a strategic focal point
about 300 u.s. marines arrived in central norway early last year for winter-warfare training
said lars georg fordal , head of the norwegian barents secretariat , which finances russian cooperation projects.
even during the cold war , nothing like this was actually happening.
