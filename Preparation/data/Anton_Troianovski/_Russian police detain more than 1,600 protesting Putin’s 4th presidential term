moscow thousands of people on saturday marked president vladimir putins upcoming fourth inauguration with street protests across russia , defying a heavy police presence that detained more than 1,600 demonstrators
police dragged the organizer , 41-year-old opposition leader alexei navalny , out of the moscow rally by his arms and ankles minutes after he arrived
protesters packed pushkin square in the center of the city nevertheless , and they were met by columns of riot police who charged into the crowd to try to disperse it
across the country , 1,612 people were detained in 26 cities , with more than 700 in the capital alone , according to the protest-monitoring website ovd-info
said natalia znaminskaya , 58 , editor of a regional journal in the moscow suburbs.
no one can survive with these salaries , and in this environment.
navalnys team organized 90 protests across the country , dubbing them he is not our czar , a reference to putin , who was first elected president in 2000 and is already russias longest-serving leader since joseph stalin
images from cities as far-flung as kaliningrad on the baltic sea , nizhny novgorod on the volga river , krasnoyarsk in siberia and khabarovsk in the far east showed hundreds or thousands of protesters
they chanted russia without putin , putin is a thief and out with the czar
in st. petersburg , hundreds walked down nevsky prospekt , the citys central thoroughfare
in russia , protests must receive the green light from authorities to go ahead , and saturdays rallies were no exception
authorities in many places , including moscow , denied permits
in the russian capital , the whine of police sirens and the chanting crowds clashed with a nearby outdoor international music festival organized by the city , where performers sang a cappella to a small audience
the protests captured the duality of the political mood in russia ahead of putins inauguration on monday to a fourth term
saturdays rallies were smaller than the ones that preceded putins last inauguration , in 2012 , when some 100,000 turned out in moscow alone in a wave of winter and spring protests
but the protests also showed the determination of navalnys sizable number of core supporters , many of them young , who are still willing to risk detention and police violence to make their voices heard
but polls show putin still has the support of most russians of all age groups , who see him as a guarantor of prosperity , stability and security in the face of an increasingly threatening west
a recent survey showed peoples readiness to participate in protests at the lowest level since 2010
the u.s. state department was critical of the heavy-handed police action
the european union also condemned the russian authorities actions , saying in a statement that the fact the rallies were not authorized can not justify police brutality and mass arrests
navalny was barred from running for president against putin earlier this year and has no clear avenue for gaining elective office
early sunday morning in moscow , navalny tweeted that he had been released after being detained for organizing the unsanctioned protest and resisting the police
still , despite having no access through state tv , he has built a following by producing viral videos spotlighting corruption among russias ruling elite and describes street protests as the only way to put pressure on the kremlin
he has built up a network of offices across the country and has staged several nationwide protests over the past year
his arrest is the latest act of government repression of dissent , which , along with perceived corruption and a stagnant economy hit by sanctions , is helping to fuel the protests
thousands protested in moscow on monday against the governments effort to block access to the telegram messaging app
fatigue with putin is another factor motivating the opposition
his new presidential term will keep him in office until 2024 , and moscow is rife with speculation that the 65-year-old putin will seek to remain in power for as long as he lives
