moscow russia banned a popular messaging app , threatened to pirate u.s. goods , and claimed great britain had orchestrated a staged chemical attack in syria all on the same day
fridays rapid-fire series of events underscored the intensity with which russias estrangement from the west and its rollback of domestic freedoms continues to play out
analysts warned that rock bottom is still far off
pro-kremlin politicians blamed the united states and its allies for the rising tensions and said that the west should stay out russias domestic affairs
even opponents of the regime said that president trumps tweet this week telling russia to prepare for a missile strike on its ally syria didnt help reduce tensions , and warned that russian president vladimir putin has many ways of increasing them even more
trump tweets condemnation of syria chemical attack , saying putin shares the blame
but the way friday unfolded showed how putin is girding for an escalating battle on multiple fronts from tamping down the opposition at home to engaging in an expanding economic and potentially even military conflict abroad
the opening salvos came friday morning
at the tagansky district court in eastern moscow , a judge heard the state telecommunications watchdogs request to block access to the telegram messaging app because it had refused to provide its encryption keys to authorities
the app , founded by russian entrepreneur pavel durov , is one of the countrys business success stories , with 200 million users worldwide
the apps channels function allows users to broadcast lengthy messages to their followers and forms a key part of russias political culture , especially for kremlin critics , who are finding traditional media more and more inaccessible
telegram can be used by terrorist organizations and extremist organizations , the regulator , roskomnadzor , said in court , according to the interfax news agency
with telegrams lawyers boycotting the hearing , the court quickly upheld the regulators request and ordered the messaging service blocked
trump administration to impose fresh sanctions against russia
a 15-minute subway ride away , at the state duma , members of the lower house of parliament were detailing proposed new legislation to retaliate against u.s. sanctions
while the sanctions announced by the treasury department in washington this month target certain people and companies close to the kremlin , the russian lawmakers proposed response was much broader
they said russia could curb u.s. food , drug , medical and services imports , and even pirate u.s. goods without regard for intellectual property rights
the kremlin stopped short of endorsing the specifics of the legislation , and some analysts said they expect the measure to be softened in its final version
but the move showed that moscow was looking for creative ways to hit back against u.s. sanctions , given russias relative economic weakness compared to the united states
kremlin backers warn of threat of war with u.s. as syria tensions rise
in the afternoon , russia further dug in as tensions remained high over syria
the defense ministrys chief spokesman , maj. gen. igor konashenkov , told reporters in moscow that western assessments of a syrian government chemical weapons attack in the town of douma last weekend were a fabrication
instead , he doubled down on russias previous claim that the attack was staged by great britain , he said , in concert with the syrian volunteer aid group known as the white helmets
konashenkov said , according to interfax
officials in washington , paris and london said they are increasingly certain that a chemical attack did take place
another source of contention is the case of poisoned former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter in the united kingdom
amid the escalating tensions , opposition leader navalny announced plans for nationwide protests against the kremlin to be held the weekend before putins may 7 inauguration for a fourth term
but in the past , tensions with the west have helped shore up putins support domestically
and to his supporters , putins assertive stance merely represents a long-overdue response to years of western encroachment on russian interests
