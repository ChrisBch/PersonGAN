president trump and russian president vladimir putin will meet july 16 in helsinki , both of their governments announced thursday , setting the stage for a high-profile attempt to soothe tensions between the united states and russia
both trump and putin have pursued the tete-a-tete in hopes of moving beyond friction over russias interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and its aggression in ukraine and elsewhere
trump wrote as part of tweets in which he also disparaged former fbi director james b. comey and once again claimed that the investigation is tainted by partisan bias
russia continues to say they had nothing to do with meddling in our election
where is the dnc server , and why didnt shady james comey and the now disgraced fbi agents take and closely examine it
why isnt hillary/russia being looked at
so many questions , so much corruption
finland , officially neutral during the cold war and not a nato member , shares a border with russia , and its president , sauli niinisto , has fostered a relationship with putin
during their meeting in the finnish capital
even small steps in reducing tensions would be in everybodys interest , niinisto said in a statement
niinisto said he had received a joint inquiry last week from high-level u.s. and russian officials about the possibility of hosting a meeting in helsinki
the summit meeting is expected to include a one-on-one meeting between trump and putin , a working breakfast , and a joint news conference , kremlin foreign policy adviser yuri ushakov told reporters
the kremlin and the white house are discussing a possible joint statement that putin and trump would issue at the summit with a plan for improving bilateral relations , ushakov said
the summit date falls after previously planned stops during a trip to europe by trump for a nato summit meeting july 11 and 12 in brussels and a visit to britain on july 13
it also allows putin to be in moscow for the world cup soccer final on july 15
trump plans to fly to helsinki after a weekend of golf in scotland , officials said
trump owns two golf courses in scotland
the guardian newspaper reported last month that he planned to play in scotland with a professional golfer or possibly a member of the royal family
trumps tweets wednesday about russian election interference underscored the scrutiny that the summit will garner in light of muellers ongoing investigation
on wednesday , secretary of state mike pompeo told the senate foreign relations committee that trump would confront putin over the allegations of russian interference
in his tweets , trump once again derided muellers investigation as a rigged witch hunt and suggested that law enforcement officials should instead investigate the relationship between russia and his 2016 democratic opponent , hillary clinton
trumps decision to highlight putins denials of russian interference drew sharp rebukes from some democratic lawmakers
sen. mark r. warner ( d-va. ) , the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee , said in tweets
other democrats voiced skepticism thursday about how much a trump-putin summit would accomplish
at the same time , u.s. lawmakers are stepping up their own engagement with russia
a congressional delegation will make a rare visit to moscow and st. petersburg from saturday to july 5 , led by sen. richard c. shelby ( r-ala. ) , russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said thursday
but russian officials are playing down expectations for any major agreements at the helsinki summit
i suggest taking a fairly pragmatic , realistic attitude toward these meetings.
the summit with putin also threatens to further rupture trumps relationships with european leaders
trump has long sought to cultivate a warm friendship with his russian counterpart as a means of solving intractable problems around the world , and has said he admires the strength of putins authoritarian rule
earlier this month , trump called for russia to be readmitted to the group of seven nations that hold economic summits
nato leaders had expressed concerns about a trump-putin meeting taking place either before or after their planned summit
a friendly trump meeting with putin ahead of the nato meeting , they reasoned , could have exposed cracks in the alliance , which is divided over whether the west should further isolate russia or open more dialogue and business dealings with it
both options are bad , concluded the diplomat , who spoke about the summit on the condition of anonymity in advance of the nato gathering
the putin-trump meeting could be a positive step because lack of communication really is a problem , said samuel charap , a russia specialist at the rand corporation think tank in washington
but , he said , in practice one has to wonder what the broader strategy with russia is right now because there are pieces moving in so many different directions at the same time that its hard to make sense of it all
there seem to be multiple u.s. policies toward russia at the moment
charap said , referring to trumps decision to scrap military exercises with south korea as an example
