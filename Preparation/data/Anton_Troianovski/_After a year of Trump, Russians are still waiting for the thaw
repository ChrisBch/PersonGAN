moscow russian nationalist leader vladimir zhirinovsky still fondly remembers the time he says a russian official working at the united nations arranged a meeting for him with donald trump
he understood that the way russia is portrayed in the american press does not correspond to reality , zhirinovsky said of trump , recalling the 2002 meeting in new york
he understood that we were even better than the americans
but as russia takes stock of year one of the trump presidency , the pundits and politicians here who predicted a sea change in relations with the united states increasingly are concluding that they bet wrong
the first year in the white house of the most pro-russian major-party presidential nominee in recent history has brought u.s.-russian relations to an even lower point than before trump took office
i thought there would be a revolution , said zhirinovsky , who hosted a champagne reception in the russian parliament after trump won
we could not possibly have foreseen all that happened
in his campaign , trump promised to improve relations with russia
he called russian president vladimir putin very smart
but in trump 's first year as president , his administration has doubled down on president barack obama 's support for ukraine against russian-backed separatists and gone along with congressional sanctions against russia
the result a civics lesson for those russians who thought that the u.s. president could wield as much influence as their own
the state news media , pro-kremlin politicians and many commentators now accuse the washington establishment and the u.s. media of spinning a fiction about russian election interference and blocking trump from carrying out his promise of a friendlier policy toward moscow
putin told reporters last month that trump has not been able to improve relations with russia even if he wanted to , because of the obvious constraints
his press secretary , dmitry peskov , called the state of u.s.-russian relations the main disappointment of 2017
using a phrase that is a favorite in russian political circles , he added , the russian political elite saw the u.s. president as being at the top of a vertical of power , as we have it here
one bellwether is zhirinovsky , a presidential candidate and longtime firebrand who revels in racially charged and xenophobic rhetoric
russians often ridicule him for his outrageous statements , but he supports putin and is one of the most prominent voices in russian politics
in an interview , zhirinovsky said he wanted to meet prominent americans , preferably politicians , when he visited new york in 2002
but a russian official working at the united nations , vladimir grachev , arranged a meeting for zhirinovsky with trump instead
zhirinovsky said that in the meeting , he tried to persuade trump to build a development in moscow and offered to help with contacts in the city government
he was the only one who agreed to meet with me , zhirinovsky said
trump apparently was already on the radar screen as someone who traveled to moscow and did n't refuse meetings with those who arrived in new york
grachev , now the deputy administrative head of russia 's central election commission , confirmed in a phone interview that he arranged the 2002 meeting as a favor for zhirinovsky , whom he had long known
the white house did not respond to a request for comment
two months after trump declared his candidacy in 2015 , russian newspapers were already quoting zhirinovsky as a trump supporter
we need trump
he shouted on a prime-time talk show the following year , in september 2016
we need to fight for a trump victory
and after trump did win , zhirinovsky hoisted a plastic cup of champagne in parliament and delivered a toast to a rapid improvement in relations between russia and the united states
a year into trump 's term , that improvement is nowhere in sight
by the end of the month , the u.s. treasury is expected to release a list of russian business executives close to the kremlin part of legislation responding to russian election interference enacted by congress over the summer
being on the list is not tantamount to being hit with sanctions , but it probably will carry a stigma
trump has given his go-ahead for the delivery of lethal weapons to ukraine for use against russian-backed separatists , a step obama avoided
and the new u.s. national security strategy , which the white house released last month , names russia alongside china as challenging american power , influence , and interests
if hillary clinton had won , then the whole elite of the u.s. would n't be so set against us , said zhirinovsky
in the 90-minute roundtable discussion of trump 's first year , the topic barely came up
zhirinovsky said he does not know whether the interference allegations are true
but even those pro-kremlin politicians who decisively reject them also sometimes voice satisfaction that more americans now see russia as a force that can not be ignored
obama called us a nation in ruins that is a small regional power
a year later , people in america are talking about nothing but russia , said andrei klimov , deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee in russia 's upper house of parliament
the only right lesson out of all this is do n't pretend that others are dwarves
