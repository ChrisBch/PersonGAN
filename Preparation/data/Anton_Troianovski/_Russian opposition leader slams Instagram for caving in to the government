moscow u.s. tech giants were thrust into the middle of the battle for russian internet freedom on thursday as instagram apparently bowed to a court order to block access to posts that embarrassed an oligarch and a top government official
russias telecommunications regulator also said it had ordered service providers to block the website of opposition leader alexei navalny , whose team dug up instagram posts that showed metals magnate oleg deripaska and deputy prime minister sergei prikhodko socializing on a yacht in norway
navalny had posted a youtube video showing the instagram posts and presenting evidence that women aboard deripaskas yacht worked for an escort service , and it went viral in russia last week
deripaska successfully sued for the removal of the posts and navalnys video , claiming they violated his right to privacy , and this week the government started implementing the court order
on thursday , telecom regulator roskomnadzor said that it had ordered navalnys website blocked and that it was satisfied that the instagram posts that deripaska sought to remove were no longer available
google , however , had not yet complied with the demand to take down navalnys video on its youtube platform , the agency said
roskomnadzor is hoping for a positive decision by google , the agency said in a statement
google did not immediately respond to a request for comment
facebook , which owns instagram , issued a statement saying that governments may ask the company to restrict access to content they say violates their laws
a facebook spokeswoman said
navalny criticized instagram on his twitter account , which remained accessible
navalny said on twitter.
shame on you , instagram
the fight touched off by navalnys video , which has been viewed more than 5 million times , represents the latest escalation between the russian government and opposition activists over freedom of speech online
while the state under president vladimir putin controls the top television networks and has cracked down on independent news media , many opposition websites and critical social network accounts remain freely accessible
navalny , who rose to prominence as an anti-corruption activist and now is calling on supporters to boycott the march 18 presidential election , has used the web to gain a nationwide following despite being shut out of the state-controlled media
his fast-paced youtube videos presenting evidence of government corruption have helped propel anti-putin protests by thousands of people across russia on several occasions in the past year
analysts say that fear of a public and international backlash , as well as a desire to maintain a veneer of openness at home , has so far discouraged the kremlin from trying to shut down navalnys communication channels
the state response to navalnys latest video suggests a new , tougher approach
while his site has been blocked several times in the past , his most-watched video so far an investigation last year into the hidden wealth of russian prime minister dmitry medvedev remains accessible on youtube
the instagram posts appear to show the aluminum tycoon relaxing on a yacht in norway in 2016 together with prikhodko
navalny said the posts and other evidence he collected showed deripaska was bribing prikhodko with the yacht trip and women working for an escort service
and sued the woman who made the instagram posts
his company basic element said in a statement thursday
deripaska filed his lawsuit in ust-labinsk , the town in southwest russian where he grew up
the court , in a proceeding closed to the news media , ordered the womans instagram posts to be removed
roskomnadzor said in its statement thursday
