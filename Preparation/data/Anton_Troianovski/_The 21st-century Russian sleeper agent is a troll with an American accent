washington not long after marat mindiyarov started working at the internet research agency , the russian troll factory indicted by the u.s. justice department on friday , he began hearing about the coveted facebook department.
there , workers could earn more money and work alongside a younger , hipper crowd
but to gain entry , job candidates had to prove they could seamlessly insinuate themselves into the american political conversation
the english-language test , which mindiyarov said he took in december 2014 , included a question about vegetarianism and another about hillary clinton and the prospect that the democratic front-runner would win the u.s. presidential election
mindiyarov , 43 and a teacher by training , wrote that clinton had a good chance of winning , and that it would be a remarkable feat , making her the countrys first female president
his bosses were not impressed
you didnt pass the test , the woman who administered the exam told him later that day , he said , although it wasnt clear if his shortcoming was imperfect english or failing to bash clinton
either way , mindiyarov remained stuck with the less-glamorous job of commenting on articles posted to russian websites and quit three months later from a job he compared to something from 1984 , the dystopian novel by george orwell
read the indictment of the internet research agency and 13 russians
allegedly leading this effort was russian catering magnate yevgeny prigozhin , often called putins chef because of his close ties to president vladimir putin
u.s. intelligence officials concluded in december that putins top aides had to approve , if not directly oversee , prigozhins operation , according to a classified nsa report , parts of which were shared with the washington post
the nsa report also said that the internet research agency , which ran online disinformation campaigns in russia itself and in foreign nations such as ukraine and the united states , used polls from american organizations to identify issues important to voters here
the russians involved in the campaign executed it with almost perfect pitch learning to mimic the way americans talk online about politics so well that real americans with whom they interacted found them in no way suspicious
such deception did not happen by accident
russian trolls worked hard to sound like americans and camouflage their political messages in other content
neither mindiyarov nor savchuk were named in the indictment
prosecutors alleged that the operation was launched in may 2014 before u.s. political figures had formally declared their candidacies giving russians time to master how ordinary americans think and talk and what they like and dislike
the trolls compiled reports on internet metrics similar to those used by many american companies to figure out which russian-created memes and posts were viewed and shared most , and by whom
those working on the disinformation campaign paid particular attention to what issues would outrage americans , making them more likely to go to the polls , and which were likely to cause them to grow disillusioned and stay home
russian trolls were even provided with a list of american holidays , prosecutors said , so they could craft appropriate content to follow the rhythms of an american year
all of this ran through an operation that closely resembled a modern american campaign , with budgets , data analysts and design teams
trolls received guidance on the ratio of text to graphics in posts , how to effectively use video and how to manage multiple accounts for maximum impact
former employees said little was left to chance
mindiyarov , the teacher , said he was paid about $ 700 a month to work a 12-hour shift , from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. two days on , two days off
his job was to write comments to append to russian-language news items , toiling in a room with 20 computers and the window blinds closed , and required to hit post quotas
sometimes , he said , he and his colleagues would engage in a group troll in which they would pretend to hold different views of the same subject and argue about it in public online comments
eventually , one of the group would declare he had been convinced by the others.
those are the kinds of plays we had to act out , he said
prosecutors said three russians , including two charged in the indictment , spent more than three weeks in the united states in 2014 and visited 10 states to gather intelligence for the disinformation campaign , which appeared to evolve over time
after a grass-roots activist in texas advised them to concentrate their efforts on purple states , such as colorado , virginia and florida , prosecutors say the russians began discussing among themselves the need to target such swing areas
russians first used ads purchased on social media and media contacts to announce rallies in new york city in june and july 2016 a place where their efforts might get attention but was hardly an electoral battleground
but by late august , they were concentrating on the crucial swing state of florida
that month , the russians allegedly used the impostor facebook group being patriotic to get americans to organize a wave of pro-trump rallies in the state
the events drew light crowds , but thousands of others learned of the effort online , giving the illusion of a groundswell of volunteer support for trump all over florida
i was supporting donald trump anyway
i didnt need persuading , said max christiansen , 28 , a lawyer in jupiter , fla. , who volunteered to host a get-together after seeing a request for volunteers posted online by being patriotic.
hyer had been politically active both online and in real life for years
she had been involved with tea party groups and had previously organized a pro-trump march through her retirement community that included a caravan of dozens of golf carts
on the day of the rally , she called a number she had been provided as a contact for the organizing group
the group had not put forward any people to join her group , and she was wondering if the man would be coming to his own rally
in unaccented english , he apologized and said he could not attend , she recalled
in the end , hyer persuaded 35 or 40 of her own friends to come out and wave signs
the russian-affiliated group had not needed to provide any people or suggest any messages
all of that came from hyer and her friends even the orange prison jumpsuit with the word clinton scrawled on the back and the blond hillary clinton wig that hyer said she wore to the rally
