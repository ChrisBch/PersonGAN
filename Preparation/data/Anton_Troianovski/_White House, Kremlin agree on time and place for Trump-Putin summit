moscow national security adviser john bolton finalized an agreement with the kremlin here on wednesday for a summit between president trump and russian president vladimir putin that moscow has been pursuing for months
after a marathon of meetings that included kremlin talks with putin himself , bolton said an announcement on the time and place of a trump-putin summit would be made simultaneously in washington and moscow on thursday
the summit is expected to take place somewhere outside russia while trump is in europe in mid-july for previously scheduled visits to belgium and britain
the meeting between trump and putin will be hotly anticipated and closely watched
it will be their first official encounter that does not take place on the sidelines of a broader international gathering
it would garner intense scrutiny because of special counsel robert s. mueller iiis investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination between moscow and trumps presidential campaign
and it could overshadow the july meeting of the north atlantic treaty organization , raising fresh questions about trumps commitment to americas traditional alliances
bolton , in a news conference in the russian capital after his meetings , dismissed those concerns while chiding trumps domestic critics
boltons push for engagement with putin struck a sharp contrast with the longtime hawks harsh criticism of the russian president before he took over as trumps national security adviser in april
last year , he described russian interference in the 2016 election as a true act of war and concluded negotiate with russia at your peril.

john bolton was once a fierce critic of putin
putin warmly greeted bolton in a grand oval meeting hall at the kremlin , flanked by statues of russian czars set before lime-painted walls
the president opened the meeting by reiterating his frequent contention that u.s.-russian relations are in a poor state in large part because of the domestic political environment in the united states
the meeting also included talks on iran , syria and nuclear arms control , officials said
the discussions very briefly touched on allegations of russian election interference , kremlin foreign policy aide yuri ushakov said
bolton said the issue of election interference would be part of the conversation when putin and trump meet
asked about his prior writings on the matter at his news conference , bolton said he would not comment on statements he made before entering his current job
secretary of state mike pompeo said last week that trump and putin will probably meet in the not-too-distant future after boltons visit to moscow
russian officials have sought such a meeting for months and have blamed u.s. domestic politics for the difficulty in making it happen
trump also has pushed for a meeting with putin despite resistance from senior political aides and diplomats
the trump-putin meeting is expected to take place while trump is in europe in mid-july
he is scheduled to attend the nato summit meeting july 11 and 12 in brussels and to visit britain on july 13
earlier wednesday , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov declined to comment on news reports that a trump-putin meeting could take place in vienna or helsinki
