moscow the wests sanctions on russia have morphed from pinpoint economic strikes into a years-long war of attrition
washington has been leading the way this year , punishing russia for actions in syria , ukraine and cyberspace , as well as for general worldwide malign activity.
meanwhile , russian president vladimir putin has been building up his countrys economic defenses , putting a priority on long-term stability over policies that could spur growth
the upshot sanctions are already crippling russias long-term economic prospects
but in the short term , it is far from certain that even the implementation of tougher measures could provoke a crisis severe enough to have a serious impact on russian politics
the latest move came tuesday with sanctions against shipping companies accused of selling oil to north korea
fresh sanctions over the poisoning of a former russian spy in england and a new sanctions bill being considered in the u.s. congress could deliver an even more serious blow
all that comes on top of sanctions on sectors of russias economy and on individuals that the obama administration and the european union put in place after the ukraine crisis erupted in 2014
in all , the treasury departments office of foreign assets control lists 491 russian people and entities , compared with 146 from china and 335 from iran
the sanctions have stunted russian economic growth and sapped the urban middle class of wealth and opportunity
but with unemployment low and inflation in check , the sanctions so far have done little to undermine the countrys fundamental economic stability
now that even tougher measures seem all but inevitable , the government is hoarding its budget surplus and boosting its reserves to safeguard its economic stability
in the process , putin is doubling down on a trade-off that seems likely to help him survive the near-term pain of sanctions while harming russias economic prospects in the longer term
his government is pumping the windfall from higher oil prices into russias rainy-day coffers , while avoiding privatization or other risky reforms that could foster a more vibrant economy and attract investors
russia has an array of resources , economists say , to prevent sanctions from touching off a crisis severe enough to quickly destabilize putins rule
but as the punitive measures pile up and putin responds by further prioritizing stability over growth the countrys long-term development prospects are increasingly being harmed
the value of russias gold holdings alone has risen to about $ 80 billion , almost twice as much as five years ago
after the international monetary fund completed a regular review of the russian economy in may , the washington-based organizations staff cautioned that the countrys income growth has stalled and is lagging behind that of other eastern european countries
but it praised the government as creating a strong macroeconomic policy framework that is helping to address rising uncertainty amid renewed geopolitical tensions.
the work of central bank chief elvira nabiullina , in particular , has drawn international recognition
the kremlin is considering a more drastic measure to secure its finances
a proposed new tax would raise as much as $ 7.5 billion a year from mining and other enterprises that have benefited from the falling value of the ruble
a leak revealing the proposal floated by putins top economic adviser drew a rare public pushback from government ministries , where officials fear that such a tax would deliver another damaging blow to the confidence of investors already fearful of state interference
in the short term , gevorgyan says , the sanctions have a silver lining
foreign investment and credit have dried up , hitting businesses large and small
but by weakening the russian currency , gevorgyan says , sanctions have aided russian exports and helped energy companies that sell their products in dollars while making their investments in rubles
putins decision in 2014 to strike back at sanctions by banning food imports from the west boosted russias domestic production to the point that , in dollar terms , russia now sells more agricultural products abroad than it does weapons
in russia , even many critics of putins government are ambivalent about the wisdom of sanctions , arguing that they strengthen the kremlins narrative of a russia besieged by the united states and undermine the development of a western-oriented middle class
milov , the economic adviser to navalny , said new sanctions would not have a short-term effect
but he said additional measures , particularly ones targeting russian government banks , as the proposed new congressional sanctions would , could eventually have an impact
