beirut tensions between russia and israel reignited sunday after russias defense ministry issued a harsh critique of israels role in the downing of a russian plane in syria last week , despite previous efforts to smooth over the rift
fifteen russian service members were killed on board the plane , one of the highest tolls in a single incident for regular russian troops since russias military intervention in syria three years ago
by failing to give adequate warning of its intention to strike in the area , in the vicinity of russias main hmeimim military base in syria , israel violated russian-israeli agreements intended to deconflict their air operations in syria , konashenkov said
he said an israeli jet had used the russian plane as cover , thereby exposing it to syrias antiaircraft fire
israel responded with a statement disputing the russian findings , saying that it had already presented russia with a detailed account of the incident that demonstrated that israel had acted within the boundaries of russian-israeli agreements
israel also claimed last week that its jets had returned to israeli airspace when the missiles were launched
israel would also continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and well-being of russias troops , it said
the criticisms from russia on sunday were in contrast to an assessment last week by president vladimir putin that the shooting of the plane was attributable to a chain of tragic accidental circumstances and not to any missteps by israel
in seeking to tamp down the tensions , he had signaled that russias ties with israel are too important to put in jeopardy , despite the deaths of the soldiers
russia gave no indication that it is planning to take any action against israel
the incident has also put the kremlin in a tough spot
acknowledging syrian responsibility for the deaths of 15 russian service members would cast an unflattering light on russias alliance with syrian president bashar al-assad , amid domestic political challenges for putin and unease in the russian public over moscows engagement in syria
blaming israel , on the other hand , also carries risks
putin has cast israel as a key partner , and russian officials point to his close relationship with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu as a prime example of growing russian influence in the middle east
