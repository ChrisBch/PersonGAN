helsinki he allegedly helped him get elected
he has charmed him and egged him on
and on monday , when russian president vladimir putin meets president trump face to face here in finlands capital , he will see what he gets out of it
coming into mondays one-on-one summit , trump faces intense pressure back home to confront putin over russias interference in the 2016 presidential election , especially in the wake of fridays indictment of 12 russian intelligence officers for hacking and releasing democratic party emails
in washington and throughout the west , leaders are also pressing trump to hold firm in countering putins intervention in syria and ukraine by refusing to recognize russias annexation of crimea
but trumps week-long tour through europe underscored his common ground with putin more than their differences
and trumps recent moves to disrupt americas traditional alliances , both with trade disputes and rhetorical broadsides , enhance russias position as putin seeks to expand moscows influence around the world
trump landed in helsinki on sunday night with what he said were low expectations and an unusually loose agenda for the kind of high-stakes international meeting that typically is tightly scripted and has predetermined outcomes
but trump has an uncommon faith in his abilities to wing it on the global stage
in a trio of tweets sent sunday from air force one , he complained that the news media would not give him due credit for the summit
when he departed washington last week , trump said meeting with putin may be the easiest part of his trip
and as in last months singapore summit with north korean leader kim jong un , he is banking on his personality to forge a lasting bond with putin that could improve u.s.-russia relations and solve some of the worlds intractable problems
in an indication of his friendly posture , trump said , under prompting in an interview with cbs news anchor jeff glor , that he hadnt thought of asking putin to extradite the 12 russian agents indicted by the u.s. justice department
for the kremlin , blaming former president barack obama and the washington establishment for the worlds ills has been one way to continue winning over trump
both trump and putin have said the investigations are undermining u.s.-russia relations and preventing progress on syria and other problems
putin spokesman dmitry peskov said last week , according to tass , a russian state-controlled news agency
in washington , democratic leaders called on trump to cancel the summit over last fridays indictments
while there is precedent obama nixed a moscow meeting with putin in 2013 in part because russia granted asylum to edward snowden , who is accused of illegally leaking u.s. intelligence secrets trump decided to go ahead with the meeting
trump has pledged to ask putin whether russia interfered in the election , though he said he assumes the russian leader will again deny it
u.s. intelligence agencies have said russia is likely to try to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections , and both democrats and republicans have implored trump to sternly warn him against doing so
sen. ben sasse ( r-neb )
said in a statement
on monday , putin is likely to try to win concessions by playing to trumps eagerness to one-up obama and reject establishment thinking
one russian objective , for instance , has been to win a more accommodating approach from trump on russias intervention in ukraine , which included the annexation of crimea in 2014
putin claims that the obama administration fomented a pro-western revolution in kiev that year in a bid to weaken russian influence , and that russia needed to take over crimea to protect russian-speaking residents of the black sea peninsula
trump has kept his options open regarding crimea
asked last week whether he intends to recognize crimea as part of russia when he meets with putin , trump blamed the situation on his predecessor
european leaders , still shellshocked from trumps ambush over defense spending at last weeks nato meeting , said they fear trump will legitimize russias claim on crimea
that , they said , would mean ending sanctions against russia , blowing up the security response and giving a green light to the redrawing of international borders by force
said r. nicholas burns , a former ambassador to nato and senior state department official in the george w. bush administration
leaders who had dealt with putin previously recounted their own experiences , being careful not to make it sound as though they were instructing trump on how to behave , the official said
among trumps statements that clashed the most with the way americas main european allies see the world were those on immigration
standing alongside british prime minister theresa may at her chequers retreat last week , trump used language similar to the white-nationalist movements to denounce immigration as permanently altering cultures throughout europe
may disagreed , but trump would find kinship with putin
the russian president has described europes immigration policy as diluting traditional national values.
and russian state media , like some conservative news outlets in the united states , has been aggressively highlighting security problems and cultural clashes arising from the migration of refugees to western europe from syria and other war-torn places
syria will be another top agenda item , officials on both sides have said
mondays summit is scheduled to start at 6 a.m. washington time with finnish president sauli niinisto welcoming putin and trump at helsinkis presidential palace , a neoclassical residence facing the nordic capitals heavily touristed baltic sea waterfront
trump and putin will first meet one on one and then be joined by their top advisers for a working lunch
they will conclude their visit with a joint news conference the first such joint news event between an american and russian president since 2010
russian officials say it was trump who insisted on holding a one-on-one meeting with putin to start mondays talks
but some of them havent hidden their anticipation that such a format will produce desired results
konstantin kosachev , chairman of the foreign affairs committee in russias upper house of parliament , said in a radio interview
within the u.s. foreign policy establishment , there is considerable concern that trump is meeting with putin without the presence of advisers or note-takers
some russia experts fear trump is a relative novice and will be taken advantage of by putin , a former kgb agent
