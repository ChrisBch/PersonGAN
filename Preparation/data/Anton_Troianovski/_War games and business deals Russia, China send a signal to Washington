meanwhile in siberia , more than 3,000 chinese troops joined russian soldiers for the countrys biggest military drills since the soviet era
china and russia regularly cooperate in bilateral exercises
but this is the first time that moscow has integrated chinese forces into its annual strategic exercises typically reserved for russias closest allies drones , paratroopers , artillery and warplanes deployed in mock battles
this years vostok ( east ) drills have been billed by the russian military as the biggest since 1981 , involving about 300,000 russian service members , more than 1,000 aircraft , 36,000 tanks and scores of ships over the next week
the addition of the chinese units underscores a potentially major shift two countries that had long considered each other potential military adversaries are now partners in confronting the united states
said alexander gabuev , chairman of the russia in the asia-pacific program at the carnegie moscow center think tank
washington is fighting a trade war with china and imposing mounting sanctions on russia
the trump administration has reoriented the u.s. national security strategy toward great-power competition with russia and china , describing both countries as seeking to shape a world antithetical to u.s. values and interests.
chinas mounting tensions with washington have raised the value in beijings eyes of russias military technology and experience , analysts say
for putin , western sanctions are making chinas economic might more attractive as he searches for new allies
the deepening military bond between moscow and beijing , analysts say , gives china valuable access to russian military technology and russias field experience in syria and ukraine
pentagon fears it is losing the hypersonic arms race with russia and china
russia in recent years started selling china some of its most advanced weapons , including the s-400 surface-to-air missile system and su-35 fourth-generation fighter jet
such sales had been hindered in the past by moscows worries that china was a potential adversary and that it would steal the technology
but amid russias conflict with the west , those worries have mostly dissipated
russian defense minister sergei shoigu said in july
few expect russia and china to enter a formal alliance akin to nato
but the two countries are sending a signal that they could partner up in a military entente in the event of a confrontation with washington in which their interests align
the relationship , independent moscow foreign policy analyst vladimir frolov said , now represents a de facto military alliance , purposefully not codified to maintain ambiguity.
chinese officials generally shy away from open talk of joining forces with russia against the united states
but in the lead-up to xis trip to vladivostok , chinas state-run media was full of effusive commentary lauding the relationship between moscow and beijing
bilateral trade is booming it is expected to cross $ 100 billion this year , up from $ 84 billion last year and the countries are deepening their economic cooperation
russia could supply its neighbor with energy , while china could share its expertise in e-commerce , analysts said
such cooperation is especially important in the current international environment , they said , hinting at president trumps protectionism
chinese e-commerce giant alibaba said tuesday that it would partner with a prominent russian oligarch and the russian sovereign wealth fund to expand into russia
this year has been a remarkable year for china-russia relations , a columnist for the peoples daily wrote , noting that putin had just visited beijing and that xi had awarded his counterpart chinas first friendship medal.
feng yujun , director of the center for russian and central asian studies at fudan university in shanghai , said the geopolitical aims of the two countries do not coincide
china is trying to integrate itself into the established international order and promote globalization , he said , while russia is not willing to obey the established order
in vladivostok on tuesday , xi gave putin a boost by bringing a delegation of nearly 1,000 chinese businesspeople and officials to the eastern economic forum , a putin-led effort to lure foreign investment to russias remote asian reaches
after hours of talks , putin took xi to the sea of japan ( east sea ) waterfront , where the presidents cooked blini thin russian pancakes
opinion china and russias game of distortion
china is also seeing benefits from the deepening relationship
kui yanwei , chinas military attache to russia , said at a briefing at the defense ministry in moscow last week
critics of the trump administrations national security strategy say that by grouping an overtly hostile russia with a less aggressive china , washington risks driving them toward greater cooperation against the united states
but defense secretary jim mattis played down the prospects
kofman , the cna researcher , cautioned that lingering tensions between russia and china shouldnt lead to conclusions that they wont cooperate militarily in the future
he noted that they could act together against the united states in an arrangement that falls short of a formal , on-paper alliance
