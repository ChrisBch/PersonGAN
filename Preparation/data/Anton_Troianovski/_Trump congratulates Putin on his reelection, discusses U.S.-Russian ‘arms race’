president trump congratulated russian president vladimir putin on his reelection victory in a phone call tuesday and said he intends to meet with putin to discuss various subjects , including an arms race that is getting out of control.
the call was initially disclosed by the kremlin and subsequently confirmed by trump in remarks at the white house
speaking to reporters in the oval office , trump said he congratulated putin on his electoral victory , adding that he and putin would get together in the not-too-distant future.
some world leaders have hesitated to congratulate putin , since his reelection occurred in an environment of state control of much of the news media and his most prominent opponent was barred from the ballot
beyond the congratulations , the kremlin said , the two leaders discussed syria , ukraine , north korea and arms control
putins reelection takes him one step closer to becoming russian leader for life
the kremlin also said that trump and putin discussed a potential meeting
trumps failure to raise moscows alleged poisoning of the former russian spy in britain risked angering london , which is trying to rally its closest allies in condemning the attack
russia has denied involvement in the march 4 poisoning of sergei skripal and his daughter , yulia skripal
but the attack has badly damaged british-russian relations , and british prime minister theresa last week announced the expulsion of 23 russian diplomats in retaliation
trump confirmed the call early tuesday afternoon to reporters who shouted out questions during a short photo session in the oval office with visiting saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman

without giving further details
the kremlins statement also noted that arms issues were discussed
putin says russia is developing nuclear arms that can avoid missile defenses
the call appeared to catch u.s. lawmakers by surprise , and sen. john mccain ( r-ariz. ) promptly denounced it
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ) also distanced himself tuesday from trumps congratulatory remarks.
well , the president can call whomever he chooses , mcconnell said with a chuckle at his weekly news conference tuesday afternoon.
when i look at a russian election , what i see is a lack of credibility in tallying the results
im always reminded of the election they used to have in almost every communist country where whoever the dictator was at the moment always got huge percentage of the vote
mcconnell added so calling him wouldnt have been high on my list.
state department spokeswoman heather nauert strongly criticized the russian elections in a news briefing tuesday , citing a preliminary report by a monitoring group , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which noted instances of intimidation
but she defended trumps call to congratulate putin as standard protocol , noting that both countries are major powers
putin won a fourth presidential term in sundays russian election , allowing him to serve until 2024
he took 77 percent of the votes , with 68 percent turnout , the government said
but putin barely campaigned , opposition activist alexei navalny was barred from the ballot , and reports of ballot-stuffing and people being ordered to vote by their employers rolled in throughout election day
putin ally warns of arms race in response to u.s. nuclear stance
at the white house press briefing tuesday afternoon , sanders said trump would continue to be tough on russia but that he also wants to have an open dialogue with putin
she twice declined to comment on how the russian election was conducted and whether it was fair
in the oval office on tuesday , trump also repeated his warnings of a possible u.s. withdrawal from the 2015 iranian nuclear deal , which was negotiated during the obama administration between iran and six world powers , including russia and the united states
trump faces a may 12 deadline to decide whether to keep in place a waiver on economic sanctions that were lifted in exchange for curbs on tehrans nuclear program
if trump does not sign the wavier , the pre-deal u.s. sanctions would automatically go back into effect
russia and u.s. allies in europe strongly support the iran deal and worry that a u.s. rebuff could leave it in tatters
well , were going to see what happens , trump told reporters
