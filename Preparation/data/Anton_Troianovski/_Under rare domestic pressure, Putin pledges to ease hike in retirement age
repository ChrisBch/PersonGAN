moscow russian president vladimir putin holds vast influence over this countrys news media , security apparatus and politics
nevertheless , he took to the airwaves on wednesday to announce a concession to critics and to plead for the peoples support
a public backlash in recent weeks against the governments plan to raise russias retirement age , unchanged for the better part of a century , has laid bare some of the potential cracks in the foundations of putins popularity
but the move was deeply unpopular , polls showed , and it sparked protests across the country
addressing the nation in an unusual televised speech , putin said he would move to reduce the new retirement age for women to 60
the revised age for men would stay the same , maintaining a discrepancy in mens and womens retirement ages in contrast with international trends
at the same time , putin sought to convince russians that painful changes remain necessary to put the economy on more solid footing
rather than blame the west , putin cast the changes as an unavoidable consequence of longer life spans and a low birthrate
the televised address , coming after a summer of criticism , was a sign that the kremlin fears the consequences of public discontent despite putins dominance over russian politics
analysts say that for all the kremlins might , putin is worried about sudden mass protests against him , the likes of which brought down leaders in ukraine and elsewhere in the former soviet union
in wednesdays speech , putin repeatedly referred to the audience as his dear friends and ended with i ask for your understanding.
and he appealed in particular to russias women , who would have seen the starker retirement-age increase under the original proposal
the crisis that could take down putins presidency
at the same time , putin used his half-hour-long remarks to argue that demographic and economic realities mean that the countrys pension system largely unchanged from soviet times needs to evolve
it was a rare instance of putin turning directly to the public to defend an unpopular measure
and it underscored the challenges that russias lackluster economic growth , undermined further by western sanctions , poses to putins rule
putin said , speaking directly to the camera from a wood-paneled office , flanked by russian flags , a large phone and a leather binder
putins approval ratings dropped to 67 percent in july from 79 percent in may , according to the independent levada center
almost 90 percent of russians opposed the pension overhaul , the pollster found
opposition politicians seized on the plan to galvanize their supporters
russia takes economic hit from new u.s. sanctions
that might help putin
activist alexei navalny , who called for nationwide protests coinciding with russian regional elections sept. 9 , was sentenced monday to 30 days in jail
analysts said the move to put navalny behind bars , as punishment for his role in organizing protests in january , appeared designed to keep the prominent opposition leader off the streets for the demonstrations opposing the pension overhaul
the blowback against the pension plan illustrated that managing russias shaky economy represents more treacherous ground for putin at home than does his foreign policy
the annexation of the ukrainian peninsula of crimea in 2014 and the ensuing conflict with the west have allowed putin to position himself as a defender of the russian people who is above the fray of daily politics
but the move to raise the retirement age suddenly brought the publics focus back to russias domestic malaise and putins approval rating dropped to a level last seen just before the annexation of crimea
beyond reducing the retirement-age increase for women , putin also promised a more generous approach to old-age benefits for people younger than the new retirement threshold
finance minister anton siluanov said putins concessions would cost an additional 500 billion rubles $ 7.4 billion at the current exchange rate over six years
kremlin backers showered putin with praise for hearing peoples concerns and taking responsibility for an unpopular policy
but navalny renewed his call for september protests
navalny said on his website.
in fact , putin today , after a long silence , supported this robbery.
