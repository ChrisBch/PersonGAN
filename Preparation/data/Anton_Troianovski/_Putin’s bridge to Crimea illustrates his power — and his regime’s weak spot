moscow president vladimir putin on tuesday opened a $ 4 billion bridge directly linking russia to crimea , giving him a propaganda victory that drew condemnation from the west and served as the latest demonstration of his personalized system of power
putin , clad in jeans and a jacket , walked on the russian end of the 12-mile-long , four-lane bridge alongside the business mogul who built it arkady rotenberg , the presidents former judo partner
then putin took the wheel and drove over the kerch strait of the black sea in an orange kamaz dump truck manufactured by a state-owned company headed by sergey chemezov , putins kgb colleague in east germany in the 1980s
both rotenberg and chemezov are under u.s. sanctions
vote or else crimeas propaganda machine fans fears in closing days of campaign
putin annexed crimea , a ukrainian peninsula in the black sea , in 2014 after claiming that ethnic russians in the region were threatened by the countrys pro-western revolution
starting wednesday morning , up to 40,000 passenger cars a day will be able to cross the bridge , drastically reducing the time it takes russians to reach crimea , which until now was accessible from russia only by plane or ferry
ukraine and the west slammed the bridge opening as illegal
the bridge , constructed without kievs consent , constitutes another violation of ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity by russia , an e.u
spokesman said in a statement
state department spokeswoman heather nauert called on russia not to impede passing ships bound for other parts of ukraine
the west and much of the rest of the world do not recognize the annexation as legitimate
but to many russians , putins return of the popular vacation destination remains his crowning achievement
in 1954 , soviet leader nikita khrushchev had transferred control of crimea from russia to ukraine
it also demonstrated , his supporters say , putins uncompromising push to put russian interests first and stand up to western hegemony
the bridge opening represented a milestone in putins efforts to show the world and his people that the annexation of crimea was irreversible
the bridge will open to truck traffic in the fall , and a railroad component is scheduled to open late next year
it has been eagerly anticipated by crimeans as an economic lifeline to their now-isolated and sanctions-hit territory
on tuesday , state television predicted that it would bring many new tourists and lower food prices to crimea
it also underscored the putin-centric system of political and economic patronage in russia
rotenbergs role as the builder of the bridge showed how russias billionaires have been able to leverage their closeness to putin to further enrich themselves while also rendering services to the state
russian media outlets have documented putins close involvement in the project at length
when a worker at the site told him in march as cameras rolled that the roadway was slated to open by the end of this year , putin responded can it be done by may
well try , the worker said
the focus on putins role , however , also hinted at a less flattering reality the untold number of poor roads , railroads and bridges across the country that dont benefit from the presidents personal patronage
the world bank ranks the quality of russias trade and transport infrastructure at 94th in the world , just behind tunisia and ahead of colombia
across the country , russians complain of corruption and poor execution hindering much-needed public works repairs and infrastructure projects
the governments push to pour money into crimea will mean even fewer funds for projects elsewhere , said dmitry oreshkin , a moscow political analyst
