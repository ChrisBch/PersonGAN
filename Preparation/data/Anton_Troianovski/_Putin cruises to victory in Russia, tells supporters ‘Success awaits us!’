moscow vladimir putin cruised to victory sunday for another six-year presidential term after an election that was long on spectacle and short on suspense
from the arctic to the international space station , russia rolled out an elaborate election-day display designed to show the breadth of putins public support as he extended his tenure for a fourth term to 2024
putins opponents on sundays ballot included a nationalist , a communist and two liberals
but putin barely campaigned , opposition activist alexei navalny was barred from the ballot , and reports of ballot-stuffing and people being ordered to vote by their employers rolled in throughout the day
with about two-thirds of the ballots counted , more than 75 percent were for putin , according to the central election commission
the runner-up was communist party candidate pavel grudinin , with 12.7 percent
the biggest question as russians went to the polls on sunday was the level of turnout , and uncertainty on the final tally lingered into the night in moscow
while independent surveys show that most russians continue to approve of putin as president , a lack of suspense or popular opposition candidates threatened to keep people home
the kremlin , analysts say , was looking for high turnout to deliver legitimacy for another putin term
even as the commission reported results , throughout the evening there was no updated information on turnout
at 6 p.m. moscow time , three hours before polls closed , the election commission said that nationwide turnout stood at 59.9 percent just above the level in the 2012 election at that time
russian cities have been plastered with billboards touting sundays election your country , our president , our choice
some cities made public transportation free on sunday , and social media posts from russias far-flung regions showed free food and giveaways at polling places
in khabarovsk in russias far east , the regional government organized a food festival to coincide with the vote that , at one polling place , was to include a presidential breakfast featuring skim-milk oatmeal with regional pine nuts
russian state tv broadcast images of lines of russian beachgoers voting in thailand , a polling place in the mountains of dagestan , mothers casting their ballots at a maternity ward , and a helicopter delivering ballots to remote settlements in the arctic
a russian on the space station was reported to have voted while in orbit
a state tv journalist reporting live from the southern city of rostov-on-don cast his ballot on camera i have done my civic duty , he said
the election was being held on the fourth anniversary of russias annexation of crimea a move core to putins domestic brand as a fearless defender of russian interests
the ukrainian territory that russia seized in march 2014 was voting sunday for the russian president for the first time after an intense propaganda campaign on the territory warning of war and same-sex marriage as the possible consequences if putins power weakened
critics described the vote as a charade , and opposition activist navalny has been urging his supporters to boycott the vote ever since he was barred from the ballot in december
the independent golos election-monitoring group broadcast a video from the city of krasnodar that it said showed people being forced to vote by their employers.
they told us at work to go vote , one of them said
online , videos of ballot-stuffing at polling stations across russia surfaced throughout the day
one such video , taken outside moscow , showed two election officials repeatedly dropping ballots into a box in the center of the room
the moscow region election commission later said that both of the women seen in the video are facing criminal charges and that the ballot box has been sealed and will not be counted
other videos published sunday showed ballot-stuffing in chechnya , dagestan and the sakha republic
while several outspoken putin opponents were on the ballot , including liberals ksenia sobchak and grigory yavlinsky , many potential voters who dislike putin stayed home to avoid legitimizing the election
daria suslina , 20 , said she decided to skip the chance to vote in a presidential election for the first time in her life after getting numerous appeals to do so by text message and at work
at a polling station in central moscow , a rush of midday voters lined up nearly out the door of a school and filled up three floors of steps to a crowded room with a handful of voting booths
outside the polling station , a 31-year-old who identified herself by her first name and patronymic , anna sergeyevna , said she voted for putin
election day was even complete with allegations of foreign meddling
a cyberattack originating in 15 countries hit the website of the central election commission overnight , according to commission chairwoman ella pamfilova , the interfax news agency reported
as with prior elections , the elections commission rolled out foreign observers to testify to the fairness of the vote
among them kline preston iv , a nashville lawyer who has done business in russia and previously said he introduced a prominent russian senator to the president of the national rifle association
preston was in crimea earlier , where he told local journalists that crimea was , is , and will always be part of russia.
preston said in a phone interview from the city of vladimir outside moscow , where he was touring polling places.
i think theres a lot more fraud in our system.
