moscow president trump proposed meeting vladimir putin at the white house in a march phone call , the kremlin said monday , a fresh revelation about a conversation that stirred controversy over trumps friendly tone toward the russian leader amid mounting tensions with the west
he did not mention any meeting venues at that time
white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said monday that a number of potential venues , including the white house , were discussed
a kremlin aide , yury ushakov , disclosed the white house invitation in comments to russian journalists monday
he added that no preparations for such a meeting have been made , according to russian news agencies
if a white house visit did come together , it would be putins first since 2005 when moscow and the west were on better terms
those relations have been in a free fall since the nerve-agent poisoning of a former russian double agent and his daughter in britain on march 4
british authorities blamed the attack on russia
trump was slow to back their assessment , but the united states on march 26 joined countries in europe and elsewhere in retaliatory expulsions of russian diplomats
here are the countries that expelled russian diplomats
the kremlin denies it had anything to do with the nerve-agent attack and has ordered tit-for-tat expulsions
the former spy , sergei skripal , and his daughter , yulia , remain hospitalized
the added detail that trump floated a white house meeting with putin renews debate over a presidential phone call that came in the midst of that political storm and drew broad criticism last month
in the march 20 call , trump congratulated putin on his reelection to a fourth term two days earlier and did not raise the nerve-agent attack
his national security advisers had urged him to condemn the skripal poisoning and included an instruction in his briefing book that said , do not congratulate , officials familiar with the call told the washington post afterward
what was discussed in trumps call to putin
such summits are a very precious commodity for russian presidents , boosting their popularity at home , and should be offered only as a reward , aron said
he noted that in addition to the spy-poisoning episode , putin last month bragged about the strength of his countrys nuclear weapons in a nationalistic speech that was accompanied by an animated video depicting warheads aimed at florida
the kremlin also scheduled the presidential election to coincide with the anniversary of russias formal annexation of crimea
if trump meets with putin as an equal given these events , aron said , he is sending the message that it is acceptable to kill more people , seize more territory.
the white house on monday sought to play down the meeting proposal
sanders said in a statement after ushakovs comments.
we have nothing further to add at this time.
she interpreted the kremlins decision to share the information on monday as a way to prove that , even though the united states expelled dozens of russian diplomats , putin still has an open door in washington.
russias interfax news agency reported
since trump became president , the two have met at the group of 20 summit in germany in july and , briefly , at the asia-pacific economic cooperation summit in vietnam in november
but a full-blown bilateral meeting has proved elusive , in part because of political head winds in washington , fanned by the investigations into russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election and into possible collusion with the trump campaign
lawmakers call for greater protections from russian election interference
for putin , a sit-down with trump at 1600 pennsylvania ave. would represent a dream come true , said vladimir frolov , an independent foreign policy analyst in moscow
frolov said of putin , a former kgb agent
he added , however , that the kremlins decision to disclose the detail about the white house invitation may also have been meant to embarrass trump , which could provoke an adverse reaction from the u.s. president
putin last visited the white house for a 2005 meeting with president george w. bush , who afterward described russia as a strong ally in the war on terrorism
dmitry medvedev , during his term as russian president , held white house talks with president barack obama in 2010 , but putin has not made another white house visit since he returned to the presidency in 2012
in 2013 , obama canceled a planned moscow summit with putin after russia took in edward snowden , the national security agency leaker facing espionage charges in the united states
the russian news media has cast the criticism of trump as too friendly with putin as evidence of the u.s. establishment seeking to undermine its presidents efforts to pursue a sober , fair-minded russia policy
